        for many hundred years ; any family above the lowest order may there find
        their origin and pedigree, and any remarkable circumstance that has attended
        any indi vidual in their family. As our time would not admit of a particular
        examination of every thing, the librarian recom mended us to confine our attention
        to the most curious ob- jects, the original manuscripts. Mr. K. seemed much
        in terested with some ancient treasures that were put into his hands, and
        I was not less so by some more modern curiosi ties. There were several original
        letters of our Henry VIII., Henry IV. of France, and Louis XIV. I was, of
        course, most attracted by what belonged to our own coun try; I read over Henry
        VIII. letters ; they were in a legible hand, and very intelligible English,
        and chiefly letters ad dressed to Anne Bullen, previous to their marriage
        ; head dresses her as deary and sweeten, and tells her his heart longs for
        her, and that his life will not be worth having ''till they meet ; with many
        other expressions not exactly suited to modern times. We were particularly
        delighted with the ancient mo numents, another subject of science and curiosity
        that would require repeated examination ; the arrangement and plan of these
        beautiful relics of antiquity was admirable, and calculated to convey useful
        instruction to the mind on more subjects than one. We were introduced to Monsieur
        Lenoir, the founder of this very curious collection, who was so polite as
        to spend some hours with us, in pointing out particular beauties, and relating
        curious anecdotes. These monuments are a collection, from every part of the
        kingdom, of beautiful pieces of sculpture and different relics of antiquity
        from the churches and mausoleums, de stroyed by the savages during the Revolution,
        and which, but for Monsieur Lenoir''s zeal and labour, would have been lost
        to posterity : here are most of the monuments of their', 1]

        additions to which have been made by the plunder of Egypt ; it contains also
        the royal collection of medals which was in the King''s ca binet ; the whole
        is very scientifically arranged, and is in excellent preservation. This room
        somewhat resembles our British Museum, with this superior advantage, that
        it is open at all times ; and every part of the library is accessible to respectable
        people, to pass what time they please there, without expence or trouble. It
        is always full of the lite rary and curious, for whose accommodation tables,
        seats, and writing utensils are provided ; the rooms are generally fully occupied,
        and numbers of people in Paris pass whole days there. In the centre of one
        of the angles of the library I observed a bijou, which scarcely seemed worthy
        of the situation it possessed : it was a piece of sculpture about ten scet
        high, representing Mount Parnassus, and little figures of the French poets
        clambering up the side; at the top is Pegasus kicking his heels, and Apollo,
        with a laurel wreath in his hand, ready to crown the first that reaches him.
        As we were introduced by a friend to the librarian, we had opportunities of
        seeing every thing to the greatest ad vantage ; but though we spent several
        mornings there, we found the time very inadequate to the purpose of seeing
        and enjoying so many literary curiosities ; years would scarcely be sufficient
        for the whole. We had no idea at first view of its extent and value ; the
        first floor, which contains all the printed books, the cabinet of curiosities,
        and the globes, forms but a small part of the building : on the second floor
        there is a gallery for manuscripts, which occupies two. angles of the building

        a little below the Nore at midnight. This day Dr. Haweis, Mr. Wilks, and Mr
        Prooksbank, the directors then on board, assembled the missionaries, and re-
        quired them to elect by ballot four persons, to constitutea committee in pursuanceof
        the print- ed instructions of the body of the directors; in consequence of
        which tbe following gentlemen were chosen and admitted to that office by the
        directors, viz-, the Rev. James Cover, John Eyre, John Jefferson, and Thomas
        Lewis*. On the 12th at four in the morning they weighed, ran through the Five
        Fathom Chan- nel, and passed through the Downs. At one in the afternoon they
        rounded the South Fore- land, and had little wind during tbe remainder of
        the day. Calms and breezes from the west- ward alternately succeeded on the
        14th, and but little way was made. It being sabbath-day, Dr. Haweis preached
        in the morning, Mr Brooksbank in the afternoon, and Mr. Wilks in the evening,
        on the quarter-deck. At eight in the morning on the Ifjth they an chored at
        Spithead, where they were speedily visited by the Rev Mr. Griffin, of Portsea,
        and other friends of the mission, who manifested the most fraternal affection,
        and furnished them with salutary supplies Here Captain Wilson arrived, and
        took the command ofthe Duff Of this the directors were informed, and they
        were ordered to wait the opportunity. The delay, however, began to weary their
        patience, as they all longed for the day of their departure; and though entertained
        with the most cordial welcome by the brethren at Portsmouth and Gosport, they
        waited the signal from the Ada mant with eager desire. Yet the stay was not
        unprofitable; the same giacious hand which directed them thither, gave them
        cause to ac knowledge his loving kindness; some good, they hoped, might result
        from the preaching of many who visited the ship, and from the missionaries
        at Portsea, Gosport, and its vicinity. Here an ingenious clergyman of Portsmouth
        furnished Dr. Haweis and Mr. Greathead, two directors of the society, with
        a manuscript vocabulary ofthe Otahetian language, and an account of the country,
        which he had preserved from the mu tineers who were seized by the Pandora,
        which was of inconceivable service to the missionaries. The missionaries,
        during this delay, con- stantly exercised themselves on board, in rota- tion,
        in preaching, prayer, and praise, which many attended ; and they also usefully
        employ- ed themselves in reading and writing, especially respecting the objects
        of their mission. In one of their assemblies, it was unanimously agreecf to
        transmit to the body of the directors a very affectionate address; part of
        which the editor thinks it his duty to introduce as a specimen of the whole.

        ; but can cheerfully give ourselves up unto him, who holdeth the wind in his

        dejection of mind, which induced the missionaries to send her on shore, at
        her request: her husband went with her, though reluctantly: he was a man of
        a meek and quiet spirit, and would probably have been an useful member of
        their community ; but the directors thought it would have been improper to
        separate man and wife. Their anxious enquiries respecting their de- parture,
        produced authentic information that they would shortly sail with a convoy
        for Lisbon and Gibraltar. Dr. Haweis, with Mr. William Wilson, went an board

        to take them under his protection. * Mr. Wilson, as chief mate, being considered

        \ was held accordingly, when there appeared for each group the list of the\
        \ names in the fol lowing statement'1'\". Their passage from Toobouai was\
        \ much 1cm 1 than they expected, variable winds and unsettled weather militating\
        \ against them. v)n the 1st of March, from tuo in the afternoon till four,\

        \ ami conflict of the elements formed a sight so truly dismal, that all on\
        \ board ac knowledged they had never witnessed any event so tremendous. On\
        \ the 21st, the articles and rules being com pletes!, they were approved and\

        \ Rio Janeiro, and, with the exception of small vessels, they had not seen\
        \ ship or shore in all this time, though they had sailetl thirteen thousand\
        \ eight hundred and twenty miles. Tired with so long beholding a vacant horizon,\
        \ and the familiar objects the sea daily presented to their view, they began\
        \ eagerly to look out for a South Sea Island ; and the time \u25A0was now\
        \ arriving when this curiosity would in part be gratified. At seven in the\
        \ morning, Toobouai was descried from the fore-yard by one of tbe seamen,\
        \ bearing south-east by east, about nine leagues off, appearing at that dis\
        \ tance like two separate islands, but on their nearer approach, they perceived\
        \ the low lauds which connected the hills. It having now been fourteen weeks\
        \ since they last saw' the land, they thought it a delightful piospect. The\
        \ wind blew fresh from Toobouai, and the captain had no intention of going\

        are more fit for a nation of children than for an en lightened one. What will
        further contribute to retard this re form is, that even several of the learned
        of mo dern Spain are of opinion that it is by no means necessary, and defend
        with warmth the old Spa nish stage ; and, proud of the applause they re ceived
        formerly from nations who were at that time in an age of darkness and bad
        taste, assert that it may still serve as an example ; and even some of them
        repay with usury those nations, and particularly the French, the reproaches
        which the rest of Europe has a right to cast on them. In 1749, Don Bias Nasure,

        The Abbe Marillo, librarian to this academy, has been commissioned to make
        an abridgment of this dictionary, in one volume, which will suffice for ordinary
        use. This academy consists of only twenty four or dinary members, but the
        number of supernume rary ones is not limited. For several years it had for
        its president a Spanish grandee, the Marquis de Santa Cruz, governor of the
        Prince of Asturias ; in which instance, it was not an empty compliment paid
        merely to his rank and birth. After his death his place was filled by his

        but beg of you, that a librarian may be sent to me in all haste, and especially
        a Greek one: for I waste much of my time in transcribing the lectures and

        at Athens: who, as it has been already said, was exceedingly'' taken with
        his virtue and good principles, of which he sent a high encomium to his father;
        and entrusted him, though but twenty years old, with a principal command in
        his army, in which he acquitted himself with a singular reputation both. of
        courage and conduct, and, in several expeditions and encounters with the enemy,
        where he commanded in chief, always came off victorious. After the battle
        of Philippi, and the death of Brutus, he escaped to Pompey, who had taken
        possession of Sicily with a great army, and a fleet superior to any in the
        empire. This was the last refuge of the poor republicans; where young Cicero
        was received again with particular honours, and continued fight ing still
        in the defence of his country''s liberty; till Pompey, by a treaty of peace
        with the triumvirate, obtained, as one of the conditions of it, the pardon
        and restoration of all the proscribed aud exiled Romans, who were then in
        arms with him. Cicero, therefore, took his leave of Pompey, and returned to
        Rome with the rest of his party; where he lived for some time in the condition
        of a private nobleman, remote frpm affairs and the court of the emperor: partly
        through the envy of the times, averse to his name and principles; partly through
        choice, and his old zeal for the republican cause, which he retained still
        to the last. In this uneasy state, where he had nothing to rouse his virtue,
        or excite his ambition, it is not strange that he sunk into a life of iudolence
        and pleasure, and the intemperate love of wine ;', 1]

        the Lords of the Privy Council. The undermost floor of the Parliament-house
        is, upon the north and east sides, entirely under ground. It is laid out in
        six apartments, not very well suited to the purposes to which they are presently
        applied. In two of them, the public records of the nation are kept. The other
        four are generously bestow ed by the town council of Edinburgh on the Faculty
        of Advo cates, for accommodating their magnificent library. Of the Advocates''
        Library. This is a very valuable collection, and is managed upon principles,
        and with an attention which render it as useful as it is valuable. The celebrated
        Sir George Mackenzie, Lord Advocate of Scotland, had the merit of projecting
        this insti tution, and of founding it A.D. 1682. For some time after its institution,
        no regular fund was appropriated to the use of the library ; and it derived
        its support chiefly from donations made to it. The catalogue of noble, and
        even royal donors, evince how much it has been thought to deserve encourage
        ment. As every advocate, at his admission, pays a certain sum to the Faculty,
        part of this was allotted to supply the library ; and, as the admission money
        has been raised, the quota for the library has been increased proportionally.
        Ths statue of Queen Anne, which, for the encouragement of learn ing, vests
        in authors a literary property, or monopoly over their works, also aids this
        collection : For by this it is provided, that, to entitle the author to that
        monopoly, a copy of every book entered in Stationers'' Hall must besent to

        by the learned Ruddiman, who is the best antiquarian Scotland has produced,
        and by Mr Walter Goodall, keepers of this library. The second, consisting
        of its late acquisitions, was compiled, A.D. 1776, by Mr Alexander Brown,

        may not oe amiss here to observe, that David Hume was some time keeper of
        this library. The books are lent out to the members of faculty in such a manner
        that the institution is more useful than that of any library we know. Besides
        printed books, the Faculty are in possession of a valuable collection of manuscripts,
        consisting of the registers of many of the Scottish monasteries, of illuminated
        missals, and of many volumes of original papers relating to the affairs of
        Scotland, as well as copies of others which have been preserved by Sir Robert
        Cotton, or are extant in the public effices in England. The faculty are also
        possessed of a collection of prints, which has, of late, been enriched by
        donations from some of the most celebrated engravers. It must, however, be
        confessed, that due attention has not been paid towards sup plying the library
        with productions in this elegant branch of the fine arts. Among other curiosities,
        the faculty are possessed of an entire mummy, preserved in its original chest.
        This was purchased by the late Earl of Morton, Lord Register of Scot land,
        at the expence of L.-00, and was by him presented to the faculty. In A.D.
        1705, the faculty purchased, and are still (as we have been told) in possession
        of a collection of coins and medals, to the number of between three and four
        thousand. These are partly Greek, Roman, Saxon, Scottish, and English. They
        are not in the custody of the librarian. For years, they have been as utterly
        lost to the whole world, as if they had been buried in the deep. Not only
        are visitors with-held from inspecting them, but even the members of faculty
        cannot get access to them. Instances have been repeatedly made in the faculty,
        for rectifying such absurd management ; but they have been always shifted
        with a fair answer and a smile, by those who assume to themselves the controul
        of the whole affairs of this society. The Parliament House forms part of the
        south and west side of the square, which goes by that name ; the west side
        of which is compleated by the Goldsmith''s Hall. The north side is formed
        by the Cathedral Church of St Giles, disfigured by low booths, built adjoining
        to the walls of the church, pos sessed by jewellers, ''she east side, and
        part of the south, are occupied by houses of a vast height, being in their

        of Physicians was incorporated by a charter of Charles II. of the 29th November
        1681, which was ratified * by parliament A.D. 1685. We had occasion formerly
        to remark f the wretched state of the medical science at that period. By this
        charter and ratification, the Royal College are granted an exclusive privilege
        of practising me- dicine in Edinburgh, of making bye laws for the regulation
        of their society, and other privileges and immunities. It is further provided
        by this statute, that the Royal College shall, at least twice a year, visit
        all the apothecaries'' shops within the city and liberties of Edinburgh, and
        destroy all insufficient and corrupted drugs i this part of their duty, however,
        they, for a long time, have omitted. The College of Physicians had formerly
        a meeting room, and some other property, near the Cowgate Port ; but the house
        having become ruinous, they did not chuse to build in that situation : they,
        therefore, disposed of the ground to the gentlemen of the Episcopal Communion
        in Edinburgh, who have there erected the English Chapel. The College of Physicians
        feued from the town of Edin- burgh a large area, in the centre of one of the
        divisions of George''s Street, in the extended royalty, on which they have
        erected a magnificent hall, the design of Mr Craig, who plan- ned the New
        Town. The foundation stone was laid by Dr Cullen, assisted by all the medical
        professors, 27th November 1775. This building extends upwards of eighty feet
        in front. It is adorned with a portico, the pediment of which is sup- ported
        by four superb Corinthian columns, which stand at a distance of six feet from
        the wall. The platform on which they are erected, is about seven feet above
        the level of the street, and the ascent to it is by a flight of steps thirty
        feet wide. The under floor contains lodging for a librarian and porter, and
        some other apartments. The second floor, to which the entry is by the stair
        leading to the portico, consists of four apartments, a lobby, which is a cube
        of thirty-feet, lighted by five windows, two on a level with the door, and
        three above. On the right hand is a room of twenty-four feet by eighteen,
        and fourteen high ; and on the left, another of the same di mensions. One
        of these apartments is intended for the or dinary meetings of the college
        ; the other for a waiting room, to accommodate those who may have business

        \ that he escaped with his life. Many of the cavaliers blamed extremely that\
        \ lenity towards him, which was so honourable in the king,and so advantageous\

        \ of taste as a more pow erful bond of union, than any difference of party\
        \ or opinion as a source of animo sity. It was during a state of poverty,\

        \ but all the compositions which had flow ed from his pen during the vigour\
        \ of his age and the height of his prosperity. This circumstance is not the\
        \ least re markable of all those which attend that great genius. He died in\

        \ that the greatest genius by far that shone out in England, during \"this\

        \ pen in theological con troversy, in factious disputes, and in justifying\
        \ the most violent measures of the party. This was John Milton, whose poems\
        \ are admirable, though liable to some objections ; his prose writings disagreeable,\
        \ though not al together defective in genius. Nor are all his poems equal\
        \ : his Paradise Lost, his Comus, and a few others, shine out amidst some\
        \ flat and insipid compo sitions : even in the Paradise Lost, his capital\
        \ performance, there are very long passages, amounting to near a third of\
        \ the work, almost wholly destitute of harmony and elegance, nay, of all vigour\
        \ of imagination. This natural inequality in Milton's genius was much increased\

        \ than Tasso, more nervous than Lu cretius ; had he lived in a later age,\
        \ and learned to polish some rudeness in his verses; had he enjoyed better\
        \ fortune, and possessed leisure to watch the re turns of genius in himself,\
        \ he had at tained the pinnacle of perfection, and borne away the palm of\
        \ epic poetry. It is well known, that Milton never enjoyed in his lifetime,\
        \ the reputation which he deserved. His Paradise Lost was long neglected:\
        \ prejudices against an apologist for the regicides, and against a work not\
        \ wholly purged from the cant of former times, kept the ig- norant world from\

        \ many faults, and, what is more material, they contain but feeble and superficial\
        \ beauties. Gaiety, wit, and ingenuity, are their ruling character : they\
        \ aspire not to the sublime ; still less to the pathetic. They treat of love,\
        \ without making us feel any tenderness ; and abound in panegyric, without\
        \ ex citing admiration. The panegyric, how ever, on Cromwell, contains more\
        \ force than we should expect from the other compositions of this poet. Waller\
        \ was born to an ample fortune, was early introduced to the court, and lived\

        between Egypt and the countries which extended to its mouth, he established
        governors from the isthmus of Suez, along the Arabian and African coasts,
        as far as the straits of Babelmandeb ; and planted colonies of Greeks and
        Egyptians to carry on the commerce, and protect the interests of his subjects.
        But the most extraordinary instance of his enterprising spirit is to be found
        in his con quest (evidently for the purpose of facilitating and securing the
        commerce of the Red Sea) of part of Abyssinia. The proof of this, indeed,
        rests entirely on an inscription found at Aduli, which there can be no doubt
        is the harbour and bay of Masuah ; the only proper entrance, according to
        Bruce, into Abyssinia. The inscription to which we have alluded was extant
        in the time of Cosmas (A. D. 545), by whom it was seen. From it, Ptolemy appears
        to have passed to the Tacazze, which he calls the Nile, and to have penetrated
        into Gojam, in which province the fountains of the Nile are found. He made
        roads, opened a communication between this country and Egypt and during this
        expedition obliged the Arabians to pay tribute, and to maintain the roads
        free from robbers and the sea from pirates ; Subduing the whole coast from
        Leucke Come to Sabea. The inscription adds : " In the accomplishment of this
        business I had no example to follow, either of the ancient kings of Egypt,
        or of my own family ; but was the first to conceive the design, and to carry
        it into execution. Thus, having reduced the whole world to peace under my
        own authority, I came down to Aduli, and sacrificed to Jupiter, to Mars, and
        to Neptune, imploring his protection for all who navigate these seas." Ptolemy
        Euergetes was particularly attentive to the interests of the library at Alexandria.
        The first librarian appointed by Ptolemy the successor of Alexander, was Zenodotus
        ; on his death, Ptolemy Euergetes invited from Athens Eratos thenes, a citizen
        of Cyrene, and entrusted to him the care of the library : it has been supposed
        that he was the second of that name, or of an inferior rank in learning and
        science, because he is sometimes called Beta; but by this appellation nothing
        else was meant, but that he was the second librarian of the royal library
        at Alexandria. He died at the age of 81, A. C. 194. He has been called a second
        Plato, the cos mographer and the geometer of the world : he is rather an astronomer
        and mathematician than a geographer, though geography is indebted to him for
        some improvements in its g 4', 2]

        \ of November, 1665, in which the founder is styled \" our trusty and well\

        \ poor, and of good affection to learning.\" The dress of the boys resembles\

        \ the county of Lancaster, Mr. Chetham gave \xA3200, to be laid out in books\
        \ to be fixed in the parish churches of Manchester and Bolton, and in the\

        \ of the said library. The right of ordering and disposing the books is vested\
        \ in the feoffees ; it is also ordered that none of the books shall be taken\
        \ out of the library, and for their better preservation they were ordered\

        \ of a brief history of Manchester from the earliest times to the period of\
        \ the Commonwealth\u2014compiled with industry, and containing a considerable\
        \ share of local information : the Lancashire visitation of Flower in 1580,\
        \ and of Smith in 1599 ; a number of manuscript pedigrees and other papers,\
        \ by the late indefatigable Mr. Thomas Barritt ; Wickliffe's New Testament,\
        \ an ancient Psalter, from the monastery of Godstow, and a very curious Pentateuch,\
        \ &c. The library contains also a number of antiquities and natural curiosities,\
        \ which are hourly expounded by the blue coat boys, to the edification of\
        \ admiring visiters. In 1791, a Cata logue of this Library was compiled by\
        \ the Rev. J. Radcliffe, A. M. the Librarian, entitled \" Bibliotheca Chethamensis\
        \ : sive Bibliothec\xE6 public\u0153 Mancuniensis ab Humfredo Chetham Armigero\
        \ Fundat\xE6 Catalogus,\" with a portrait of the founder. One of the last\
        \ facts mentioned in Hollingworth's Mancuniensis is sufficiently indicative\
        \ of the return of the country to a state of settled peace and confidence\
        \ : in the year 1652, says he,a \" The towne (of Man chester) was dismantelled\
        \ ; the walls throwne down ; the gates solud or carried away.\" This act seems\
        \ to have been entirely voluntary on the part of the inhabitants and the authorities\
        \ of the town, after their frail military works had existed for ten years.\
        \ Although the barons of Manchester held a seat by writ of summons in the\
        \ upper house of parliament, by successive calls from the twelfth to the sixteenth\
        \ century, this town was never represented in the commons till the year 1654,\
        \ when the Lord Protector, desirous to strengthen his government, and willing\
        \ to stamp a dignity upon a town to which the Commonwealth was so much indebted,\
        \ issued a writ to the high sheriff of the county of Lancaster, requiring\
        \ the burgesses of Manchester to re turn a member to parliament.\"]: This\
        \ mandate the inhabitants duly obeyed, and the following indenture, preserved\
        \ in the archives of the newly enfranchised borough, and never before published,\

        \ the expenditure in this department has for some years been gradually diminishing,\

        \ to the prosperous state of trade. The The history of the public press of\
        \ Preston is contained in a narrow Pre**- compass: In the year of the rebellion\
        \ of 1745, the first newspaper ever published in this town appeared, under\
        \ the title of The British Courant. or Preston Journal, published by James\
        \ Stanley and John Moor ; but, from lack of patronage, this Journal was at\
        \ a subsequent period discon- tinued. At the breaking out of the revolutionary\
        \ wars between France and England, when the thirst for news was ardent in\
        \ the extreme, the late Mr. Thomas Walker established a newspaper, entitled\
        \ The \u2022June 1st. Preston Review, the first number of which was published\
        \ in 1793 ;a after languishing through a few years with indifferent success,\
        \ this Journal ceased. The next effort to supply the inhabitants with a me\
        \ dium of intelligence and of commercial and professional annunciation, was\
        \ made with better success, by stir. Thomas Croft, who issued the first number\
        \ of his publication on the 7th of February, 1807, under the title of The\
        \ Preston Journal ; and this newspaper is still continued on the Saturday,\
        \ by Mr. Isaac Wilcockson, under the altered title of The Preston Chronicle,\
        \ which it took on the 5th of September, 1812. A newspaper, called The Preston\
        \ Sentinel, was published by Mr. L. Clarke, from Saturday the 7th of April,\
        \ 1821, to Saturday the 30th of March, 1822, when it was discontinued; but\
        \ on the 1st of January, 1825, ano ther newspaper was issued from the same\
        \ office, called The Preston Pilot, which is published on the Saturday. No\
        \ works of any great note have issued from the press in this town, though\
        \ several men of literary eminence have received their education here.* The\
        \ town of Preston is deeply indebted to an alderman of this borough of the\
        \ name of Shepherd, a physician of eminence, who died on the 4th of December,\
        \ 1761, bequeathing, by will, \" all and every of his \" books, of what nature\

        are written, and for this reason, as well as for that of enabling the librarian
        to take them out and put them in again with greater facility, the books are
        placed with the edges outwards. Amongst the curiosities of this library is
        preserved with much care a large folio volume, in which the four Gospels,
        and certain productions of the holy fathers, are written in letters of gold.
        It was commenced by direction of the Emperor Con rad, and finished in the
        time of his son, Henry II., and is, therefore, at least seven hundred and
        eighty years old ; yet the letters appear as fresh as if they were recently
        executed. The pages are beautifully illuminated. Another curious volume is
        also shown, which contains the Apocalypse ex quisitely written. At the beginning
        of each chapter there is an illuminated representation of its contents. Over
        this library there is another apartment equally exten sive, which is chiefly
        appropriated to manuscripts in Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, Latin, and other languages.
        Amongst these are several very ancient Bibles in different languages, particularly
        a Greek copy a httle injured, which belonged to the Emperor Cantacuene, and
        is said to agree very closely with that of the seven interpreters. Not the
        least curious of these trea sures is an Alcoran. The total number of the manuscripts
        is at present estimated at four thousand; and of printed books, in both libraries,
        at twenty-four thousand. Their number was at one time considerably greater,
        but several of the former were consumed in a destructive fire which oc curred
        in the Escurial in 1671 ; and when the intrusive king was in Madrid, he ordered
        the printed books to be removed to the convent of the Trinity in that capital.
        Upon the restoration, they were conveyed back to the Escurial, but upwards
        of ten thousand were found missing. From the libraries we descended to the

        figure of a Roman H. Another room near these, contains the valuable collection
        of topo graphical and other works, lately bequeathed to the University by
        that learned antiquary, Mr. Cough. Below the Library, on the same staircase,
        is an apartment called the Aucta rium, fitted up in 1788, for the reception
        of classical manuscripts, early printed classics, &c. In an adjoining room
        there is a very fine col lection of oriental manuscripts. Strangers fond ofthe
        study of bibliography, may, through the introduction of a Master of Arts,
        or any gen tleman well known in the University, derive what information they
        may wish for relative to the curious contents of this invaluable Library,
        from the Librarian, or Sub- Librarians. All members of the University who
        have taken a degree, are admitted to study in the Library; no books are suffered
        to be taken from it. Literary characters, either natives or e2', 2]

        to 44. Even at so late a period as the reigns of Nectanebo the first, of Teos,

        right reverends came out two or three in a year ; and I found, by Dr. War-
        burton''s railing, that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good company.
        However, I had a fi.xed resolution, which I inflexibly main- tained, never
        to reply to any body; and not being very irascible in my temper, I have easily
        kept myself clear of all literary squabbles. These symptoms of a rising reputation
        gave me encouragement, as I was ever more disposed to see the favourable than
        unfavourable side of things ; a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess,
        than to be born to an estate of 10,0002. a year. In 1751, I removed from the
        country to the town, the true scene for a man of letters. In 1752 were published
        at Edinburgh, where I then lived, my Political Discourses, the only work of
        mine that was success- ful on the first publication. It was well received
        abroad and at home. In the same year was published at London, my Inquiry concerning
        the Principles of Morals ; which in my own opinion (who ought not to judge
        on that subject) is, of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary,
        incomparably the best. It came unnoticed and unobserved into the world. In
        1752 the Faculty of Advocates chose me their librarian ; an office from which
        I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large
        library. I then formed the plan of writing the History of England ; but being
        frightened with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of seventeen
        hundred years, I commenced with the accession of the House of Stuart ; an
        epoch when I thought the misrepresentation of faction began chiefly to take
        place. I was, I own, sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work.
        I thought that I was the only historian that had at once neglected present
        power, interest, and authority, and the cry of popular prejudices ; and as
        the subject was suited to every capacity, I expected proportional applause.
        But miserable was my disappointment ; I was assailed by one cry of reproach,
        disapprobation, and even detestation ; English, Scotch, and Irish, Whig and
        Tory, churchman and sectary, freethinker and reli- gionist, patriot and courtier,
        united in their rage against the man who presumed to shed a generous tear
        for the fate of Charles I. and the Earl of Stratford ; and after the first
        ebullitions of their fury were over, what was still more mortifying, the book
        seemed to sink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he
        sold only forty-five copies of it. I scarcely indeed heard of one man in the
        three kingdoms, consider- able for rank or letters, that could endure the
        book. I must only ex- cept the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the primate
        of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions. These dignified prelates
        separately sent me messages not to be discouraged. I was, however, I confess,
        discouraged ; and had not the war at that time been breaking out between France
        and England, 1 had certainly retired to some provincial town ofthe former
        kingdom, have changed my name, and never more have returned to my native country.
        But as this scheme was not now practicable, and the subsequent volume was
        considerably advanced, I resolved to pick up courage, and to per severe. In
        this interval I published at London my Natural History of Reli gion, along
        with some other small pieces: its public entry was rather obscure, except
        only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against it with', 1]

        purpose of a proctor, by inspecting the conduct, and visiting nightly the
        lodgings of the students. The library should be open in college hours, to
        the use of ministers, and studious men of all denominations; and there should
        be attached to every college a society, or academy of literature and science;

        and extensive learning; and their transactions, or contributory papers, whether

        \ after his appointment as Secretary to the Record Commission, the public\
        \ were righly indebted to his activity in that office ; and that to the death\
        \ of the late Lord Colchester he enjoyed the full confidence of that enlightened\
        \ Speaker, who may be said to have been the main spring of the first Record\
        \ Commision, ai-d who was an excellent judge of lite niy merit, and exacted\
        \ from his pro tegees no common share of activity and zeal. Among the Commissioners,\
        \ Lord Frederick Campbell and Lord Redesdale, were Mr. Caley's particular\
        \ friends. At the close of 1813, Mr. Caley en gaged to assist in editing tbe\
        \ new edition of Dugdale's Monasticon, in conjunction with Dr. Bandineland\
        \ Sir Henry Ellis. These various literary engagements were combined with others\
        \ of a different character, but no less remarkable for their multiplicity.\
        \ He belonged to so many clubs, that he seldom dined at home, and there were\
        \ frequently several din ners at which he was expected the same day. He used,\
        \ however, to declare that he always preferred a private to a public company.\
        \ With these habits he enjoyed very excellent health to an advanced period\
        \ of his life ; bis manners were ever courteous, and his conversation agreeable.\
        \ Mr. Caley amassed a large library, particularly rich in topography, many\
        \ of them presented by tbe authors, in return for tbe communications with\
        \ which he was able to furnish them from the Record offices under his superintendence.\
        \ His kindness to authors on these occasions is gratefully recorded in the\
        \ prefaces to many topographical works. As a col- lector, he particularly\
        \ devoted his atten- tion lo monastic seals, which he assembled both in wax\
        \ and sulphur casts and in vo- lumes of drawings. Tbelatter were chiefly made\
        \ by the late Mr. Bartholomew Hew- lett, the engraverof Views in Lincolnshire,\
        \ who, for a considerable time, used to sup- ply him with eight drawings every\
        \ week. His library and collections have been sold by Mr. Evans during nine\
        \ days of the month of July. The manuscripts were not numerous or particularly\
        \ curious ; but we may mention two quarto volumes of Collections relating\
        \ to Suffolk, which were sold for 11. 10s. ; and a Repertory of the Archives\
        \ of the Dean and Chap- ter of Westminster, compiled by R. Wjdmore, Librarian\
        \ to the Chapter, which was sold for 61. 6s. The Col- lection of Reports and\
        \ Searches made by Mr. Caley, as a legal antiquary, during fifty years, bound\
        \ in seventy-eight volumes, with one of Index, and three in boards, was sold\
        \ for 400/. Twenty-five volumes of MS. indexes to and extracts from Records\
        \ in the Augmentation Office, were sold for 2251. The collection of drawings\
        \ (before mentioned) of the Monastic Seals of England, Scotland, Wales, and\
        \ some of Normandy, about fifteen hundred in number, and bound in eight volumes,\
        \ was sold for 290/. As Mr. Caley was accus tomed to pay for them singly,\
        \ at from 5s. to 10s. a drawing, they must have cost him a much larger sum\
        \ than they pro duced. They were followed by a large quantity of wax and sulphur\
        \ impressions, the lots of which were arranged in coun ties ; these were sold\
        \ at a price consider ably higher than that at which the greater part of them\
        \ may be purchased from the collection of our ingenious friend, Mr. Doubleday.",

        having found the classic writers miserably deformed by the hands of monkish
        librarians, very commendably employed their pains and talents in restoring
        them to their native purity. The second, the plagiaries from those French
        critics, who had made some admi rable commentaries on the ancient critics.
        But that acumen and taste, which separately constitute the distinct value
        of those two species of Italian and French criticism, make no part of these
        paltry mimics at home, described by our poet in the following lines, " These
        leave their sense, their learning to display, And those explain the meaning
        quite away." which species is the least hurtful, the poet has enabled us to
        de termine in the lines with which he opens his poem. " But of the two, less
        dangerous is the offence, To tire our patience, than mislead our sense." Warburton.

        to attend us to the Dublin Society-house, and to intro duce us to Sir Charles
        Gieseke, a distinguished pro fessor in the institution. The building appropriated
        to the Society is Leinster-house, formerly the town residence of the Duke

        a fine park adjoining it. The library belonging to the in stitution is not

        does not pro bably exceed 5000. Dr L., the librarian, we found very intelligent
        and obliging. The museum is rich, containing a very valuable collection of
        specimens in ornithology, and one still finer in the mineralogical department.
        It was pleasing to view a case of mine rals which had been selected in various
        places in the United States, particularly in New England ; among which we
        read the labels of Northampton, Lake George, New Haven, and others. The museum
        and mineralogical cabinet have been splendidly arranged under the immediate
        direction of Sir Charles Gieseke ; and there is a large apartment solely devoted
        to a col lection of rarities, presented by him to the institution. It was
        gratifying to us to form an acquaintance with this extraordinary man. Sir
        Charles is a German, ori ginally from Vienna, if I mistake not, and has for
        many years been honoured with the favourable regards', 1]

        \ language, which I had too much neg- j lected in my early youth. i In 1745,\
        \ I received a letter from the mar- 1 quis of Annandale, inviting me to come\
        \ and 5 live with him in England ; I found also, that ; the friends and family\
        \ of that young noble- I man were desirous of putting him under my \\ care\
        \ and direction, for the state of his mind j and health required it. \u2014\
        \ I lived with him a } twelvemonth My appointments during that ! time made\
        \ a considerable accession to my ; small fortune. I then received an invitation\
        \ $ from general St. Clair, to attend him as a \xBB' secretary to his expedition,\
        \ which was at first ; meant against Canada, but ended in an in- 5 cursion\
        \ on the coast of France. Next year, \xBB to wit, 1747, I received an invitation\
        \ from : the general to attend him in the same station t in his military embassy\
        \ to the courts of* Vienna and Turin. I then wore the uniform \xBB of an officer,\
        \ and was introduced at these 5 courts as aid-de-camp to the general, along\
        \ > with sir Harry Erskine and captain Grant, : now general Grant. These two\
        \ years were * almost the only interruptions which my \xBB studies have received\
        \ during the course of* my life : I passed them agreeably, and in I good company\
        \ ; and my appointments, with : my frugality, had made me reach a fortune,\
        \ i which I called independent, though most of' my friends were inclined to\
        \ smile when I ; said so : in short, I was now master of near : a thousand\
        \ pounds. : I had always entertained a notion, that : my want of success in\
        \ publishing the Treatise * of Human Nature had proceeded more from $ the\
        \ manner than the matter, and that I had i been guilty of a very usual indiscretion,\
        \ in j going to the press too early. I therefore $ cast the first part of\
        \ that work anew in the ! Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, j which\
        \ was published while I was at Turin. ; But this piece was at first a little\
        \ more sue- j cessful than the Treatise of Human Nature. j On my return from\
        \ Italy, I had the mortifica- : tion to find all England in a ferment, on\
        \ ac- j count of Dr. Middleton's Free Enquiry, I while my performance was\
        \ entirely over- ; looked and neglected. A new edition, which \xBB had been\
        \ published in London, of my Essays, i moral and political, met not. with\
        \ a much better reception. Such is the force of natural temper, that these\
        \ disappointments made little or no im pression on me. I went down in 1749,\
        \ and lived two years with my brother at his coun try-house, for my mother\
        \ was now dead. I there composed the second part of my Essay, which I called\
        \ Political Discourses, and also my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals,\
        \ which is another part of my Trea tise that I cast anew. Meanwhile my book\

        \ very irascible in my temper, I have easily kept myself clear of all literary\

        \ not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical,\
        \ or literary, incomparably the best. It came unnoticed and unobserved into\

        \ fanaticism which so much in fected the parliamentary party, was no less\
        \ destructive of taste and science, than of all law and order. Gaiety and\
        \ wit were pro scribed : human learning despised : freedom of inquiry detested\

        \ on in the preliminaries to the treaty of Oxbridge, that all play-houses\
        \ should for ever be abolished. Sir John Davenant, says Whit locke,j| speaking\
        \ of the year 1658, published an opera, notwithstanding the nicety of the\
        \ times. All the king's furniture was put to sale : his pictures, disposed\
        \ of at very low prices, enriched all the collections in Europe: the cartoons,\
        \ when complete, were only ap- praised at 300 pounds, though the whole col-\
        \ lection of the king's curiosities was sold at above 50,000.\xA7 Even the\
        \ royal palaces were I pulled in pieces, and the materials of them : sold.\

        \ to be | brought to auction, in order to pay the arrears I of some regiments\
        \ of cavalry quartered near j liondon : but Selden, apprehensive of the loss,\
        \ I engaged his friend Whitlocke, then lord i keeper for the commonwealth,\
        \ to apply for the j office of librarian. This expedient saved that j valuable\
        \ collection. Contained 25,000 souls.* For a like reason, the catholics, afterwards,\
        \ who found them selves exposed to many hardships, and dreaded still worse\
        \ treatment, went over to America in great numbers, and settled the colony\
        \ of Maryland. Before the civil wars, learning and the fine arts were favoured\
        \ at court, and a good taste began to prevail in the nation. The king loved\
        \ pictures, sometimes handled the pencil himself, and was a good judge of\
        \ the art. The pieces of foreign masters were bought up at a vast price ;\
        \ and the value of pictures doubled in Europe by the emulation between Charles\
        \ and Philip the IV. of Spain, who were touched with the same elegant passion.\
        \ Van dyke was caressed and enriched at court. Inigo Jones was master of the\
        \ king's build ings ; though afterwards persecuted by the parliament, on account\
        \ of the part which he had in rebuilding St. Paul's, and for obeying some\
        \ orders of council, by which he was directed to pull down houses, in order\
        \ to make room for that edifice. Laws, who had not been surpassed by any musician\
        \ before him, was much beloved by the king, who called him the father of music.\
        \ Charles was a good judge of writing, and was thought by some more anxious\
        \ with regard lo purity of style than became a monarch.-]- Notwith standing\
        \ his narrow revenue, and his freedom from all vanity, he lived in such magnificence,\
        \ that he possessed four-and-twenty palaces, all of them elegantly and completely\
        \ furnish ed : insomuch that, when he removed from one to another, he was\
        \ not obliged to transport any thing along with him. Cromwel, though himself\
        \ a barbarian, was not insensible to literary merit. Usher, not withstanding\
        \ his being a bishop, received a pension from him. Marvel and Milton were\
        \ in his service. Waller, who was his relation, was caressed by him. That\

        to the awful desolations of intemperance, and to the great work of reformation
        which is now extending around us. Most decided is our opinion that this alarming
        evil is only to be suppressed by a general union in the means of entire abstinence
        from all ar dent spirits, as a drink, or as an auxiliary to labor. It is auspicious
        to our community that it has pleased Heaven to bless us with the temperance

        \ till is now computed to contain between 4,000 and 5,000 volumes. By the\

        \ called the 'Economical Library,' designed principally for the use and instruc\
        \ tion of the working classes. The terms of this society were so extremely\
        \ moderate that the library never attained much eminence or usefulness. In\
        \ January, 1825, an arrangement was made between the committee of the Mechanics'\
        \ Institute and the remaining members of the Economical Library, that whatever\
        \ books the latter con tained, which were deemed eligible by the committee\
        \ for the Mechanics' Library, should be added to it, and the members of the\
        \ Economical be incorporated with the Mechanics' Institution, and privileged\
        \ according to their respective terms of membership. In 181 7, a party of\
        \ gentlemen, of scientific and literary pursuits, united themselves in a society\
        \ called the \" Natural History Society.\" The ostensible object of this institution\
        \ was the elucidation of the natural history of this county ; and it was honoured\
        \ with the patronage of the Earl of Lonsdale. Some few interesting essays,\

        A. x. A small quarto volume, consisting of three dif ferent MSS. bound together,
        which originally had no connection with each other. Prefixed is an imperfect
        list of contents, in the hand-writing of James, the Bodley Librarian. The
        first portion consists of a panegyrical oration in Latin by Justus de Justis,
        on John Chedworth, archdeacon of Lincoln, dated at Verona, 16r>Ju1j, 1468.
        It occupies thirty-six folios, written on vellum, and is the original copy
        presented by the author. The second portion is that we are more immediately
        concerned with. It is de scribed by James as " Veties poema Anglicanum, in
        quo sub insomnii figmento multa ad religionem et mores spectantia explicantur,"
        and this account with some slight changes is adopted by Smith and Planta,
        in their catalogues ; both of whom assign it to the fifteenth century. It
        will appear, by what follows, that no less than four distinct poems have been
        confounded together by these writers. This portion of the volume extends from
        fol.37 to fol.126, inclusive, and is written by one and the same hand, in
        a smalls sharp, irregular character, which is often, from the paleness of
        the ink, and the contractions used, difficult to read. There are no titles
        or rubrics, but the divisions are marked by large initial letters of blue,
        florished with red, and several illuminations, coarsely executed, serve by
        way of illustration, each of which occupies a page. 1. Four of these are prefixed
        to the first poem. In the first the Author is represented slumbering in a
        meadow, by the side of a streamlet, clad in a long red gown, having falling
        sleeves, turned up with white, and a blue hood', 1]

        A. x. A small quarto volume, consisting of three dif ferent MSS. bound together,
        which originally had no connection with each other. Prefixed is an imperfect
        list of contents, in the hand-writing of James, the Bodley Librarian. '' i
        . . The first portion consists of a panegyrical oration in Latin by Justus
        de Justis, on John Chedworth, archdeacon of Lincoln, dated at Verona, 16 July,
        1468. It occupies thirty-six folios, written on vellum, and is the original
        copy presented by the author. The second portion is that we are more immediately
        concerned with. It is de scribed by James as " Vetus poema Anglicanum, in
        quo sub insomnii jigmento multa ad religionem et mores speetantia explicantur,"
        and this account with some slight changes is adopted by Smith and Planta,
        in their catalogues ; both of whom assign it to the fifteenth century. It
        will appear, by what follows, that no less than four distinct poems have been
        confounded together by these writers. This portion of the volume extends from
        fol.37 to sol. 126, inclusive, and is written by one and the same hand, in
        a small, sharp, irregular character, which is often, from the paleness of
        the ink, and the contractions used, difficult to read. There are no titles
        or rubrics, but the divisions are marked by large initial letters of blue,
        florished with red, and several illuminations, coarsely executed, serve by
        way of illustration, each of which occupies a page. 1 . Four of these are
        prefixed to the first poem. In the first the Author is represented slumbering
        in a meadow, by the side of a streamlet, clad in a long red gown, having falling
        sleeves, turned up with white, and a blue hood', 1]

        \ great research in physical science, and studied under the celebrated Cornelius\
        \ Agrippa, against whom the charge of sorcery was repeatedly alleged by Paulus\
        \ Jovius, and other authors, while he suffered on the other hand from the\
        \ persecution of the inquisitors of the church, whose accusation against this\
        \ cele brated man was, that he denied the existence of spirits, a charge very\
        \ inconsistent with that of sor cery, which consists in corresponding with\
        \ them. Wierus, after taking his degrees as a doctor of me dicine, became\
        \ physician to the Duke of Cleves, at whose court he practised for thirty\
        \ years, with the highest reputation. This learned man, disregarding the scandal\
        \ which, by so doing, he was likely to briug upon himself, was one ofthe first\
        \ who attacked the vulgar belief, and boldly assailed, both by serious arguments\
        \ and by ridicule, the vulgar credulity on the subject of wizards aud witches.\
        \ subordinate articles of credulity in England ; but the belief in witches\
        \ kept its ground. It was rooted in the minds of the common people, as well\
        \ by the easy solution it afforded of much which they found otherwise hard\
        \ to explain, as in reverence to the Holy Scriptures, in which the word witch,\
        \ being used in several places, conveyed to those who did not trouble themselves\
        \ about the nicety of the translation from the Eastern tongues, the inference\
        \ that the same species of witches were meant as those against whom modern\
        \ legislation had, in most European nations, directed the punishment of death.\
        \ These two circum stances furnished the numerous believers in witch craft\
        \ with arguments in divinity and law which they conceived irrefragable. They\
        \ might say to the theo logist, Will you not believe in witches? the Scriptures\
        \ aver their existence; \u2014 to the jurisconsult, Will you dispute the existence\
        \ of a crime, against which our own statute-book, and the code of almost all\
        \ civil ized countries, have attested, by laws upon which hundreds and thousands\
        \ have been couvicted, many, or even most, of whom have, by their judicial\
        \ con fessions, acknowledged their guilt and the justice of their punishment?\
        \ It is a strange scepticism, they might add, which rejects the evidence of\
        \ Scripture, of human legislature, and of the accused persons themselves !\
        \ Gabriel Naude, or Naud\xE6us, as he termed him self, was a perfect scholar\
        \ and man of letters, busied during his whole life with assembling books together,\
        \ and enjoying the office of librarian to several persons of high rank, amongst\
        \ others, to Queen Christina of Sweden. He was, besides, a beneficed clergyman\
        \ leading a most unblemished life, and so temperate, as never to taste any\
        \ liquor stronger than water ; yet did he not escape the scandal which is\
        \ usually flung Notwithstanding these specious reasons, the six teenth and\
        \ seventeenth centuries were periods when the revival of learning, the invention\
        \ of printing, the fearless investigations of the reformers into subjects\
        \ thought formerly too sacred for consideration of any save the clergy, had\
        \ introduced a system of doubt, inquiry, disregard of authority when unsupported\
        \ by argument, and unhesitating exercise of the private judgment, on subjects\
        \ which had occupied the bulls of popes, and decrees of councils. In short,\
        \ the spirit of the age was little disposed to spare error, however venerable,\
        \ or countenance imposture, how ever sanctioned by length of time and universal\
        \ acquiescence. Learned writers arose in different countries to challenge\
        \ the very existence of this imaginary crime, to rescue the reputation of\
        \ the great men whose knowledge, superior to that of their age, had caused\
        \ them to be suspected of magic, and to put a stop to the horrid superstition\
        \ whose victims were the aged, ignorant, and defenceless, and which could\
        \ only te compared to that which sent victims of old through the fire to Moloch.\
        \ The courageous interposition of those philosophers who opposed science and\
        \ experience to the prejudices of superstition and ignorance, and in doing\
        \ so, in curred much misrepresentation, and perhaps no little ill-will, in\
        \ the cause of truth and, humanity, claim for them some distinction in a work\
        \ on Demonology. The pursuers of exact science to its coy retreats were sure\
        \ to be the first to discover, that the most remarkable phenomena in nature\
        \ are regulated by certain fixed laws, and cannot rationally be referred to\
        \ supernatural agency, the sufficing cause to which superstition attributes\
        \ all that is beyond her own narrow power of explanation. Each advance in\
        \ na tural knowledge teaches us that it is the pleasure of the Creator to\
        \ govern the world by the laws which he has imposed, and which are not in\
        \ our times interrupted or suspended. by their prejudiced contemporaries upon\
        \ those dis putants whom it is found more easy to defame than to answer. He\
        \ wrote an interesting work, entitled Apologie pour les Grands Ho mm es accuses\
        \ de Magie; and as he exhibited a good deal of vivacity of talent, and an\
        \ earnestness in pleading his cause, which did not always spare some of the\
        \ superstitions of Rome herself, he was charged by his contemporaries as guilty\
        \ of heresy and scepticism, when justice could only accuse him of an incautious\
        \ eagerness to make good his argument. Among persons who, upon this subject,\
        \ purged their eyes with rue and euphrasy, besides the Rev. Dr. Harsnet, and\
        \ many others (who wrote rather on special cases of Demonology than on the\
        \ general ), Reginald Scot ought to be distinguished. Webster assures us,\
        \ that he was a \" person of com petent learning, pious, and of a good family.\"\
        \ \u2014 He seems to have been a zealous Protestant, and much of his book,\
        \ as well as that of Harsnet, is designed to throw upon the Papists in particular\
        \ those tricks, in which, by confederacy and imposture, the popular ideas\
        \ concerning witchcraft, possession, and other supernatural fancies, were\
        \ maintained and kept in exercise; but he also writes on the general question\
        \ with some force and talent, considering that his sub ject is incapable of\
        \ being reduced into a regular form, and is of a nature particularly seductive\
        \ to an ex cursive talent. He appears to have studied leger demain for the\
        \ purpose of showing how much, that is apparently unaccountable, can nevertheless\
        \ be performed without the intervention of supernatural assistance, even when\
        \ it is impossible to persuade the vulgar that the devil has not been consulted\
        \ on the occasion. Scot also had intercourse with some of the celebrated fortune-tellers,\
        \ or Philomaths, of the time ; oue of whom he brings forward to declare the\
        \ va nity of the science which he himself had once professed.", 1]

        still more sensibly than before we had seen those of Rome. The Santo Spirito
        is a noble building ; the simple grandeur of its long and spacious aisles
        has something more pleasing to me than all the gorgeous decorations of the
        churches in Rome, where " Porphyry, jasper, agate, and all hues Of gem and
        marble," scattered M''ith a lavish hand, and often combined M''ith little

        entering " the long draMn aisles" of our own beautiful cathedrals. In most
        of the Florentine churches there is less of idle decoration, and they are
        in consequence more grand and imposing. We have spent some hours this morning
        in the famous Laurentian Library, which is one of the most valuable depositories
        of ancient manuscripts in the world, containing upMards of nine thou sand.

        lieved him from the apathy of the cognoscenti, the envy of rivals, and the
        neglect of a tasteless public. For AVilson, whose works will soon command
        prices as proud as those of Claude, Poussin, or Elzheimer, resembled the last
        most in his fate ; lived and died nearer to indigence than ease ; and as an
        asylum from the severest wants incident to age and decay of powers, was reduced
        to solicit the librarian''s place in the academy of which he was one of the
        brightest ornaments." The village of Roath or Rhath, adjoins Cardiff on the
        e. side. AV. AVilliams and Charles Crofts AA''illiams, Esq. Out of the ruins
        of this ancient town and Roman station, Cardiff was formed into a principal
        town by Jestin ab Gwrgan in 1080. The Harbour op Penarth affords an excellent
        shelter for vessels bound w. down the Channel; and the junction of the canal
        gives some importance to the trade of this place. The Sea Lock is the only
        one in the Prin cipality. AAlien the tide is in, vessels of 400 tons burden
        can be ad mitted into the canal by this machine and brought near the town,
        where there are excellent wharfs for the convenience of shipping. The Canal,
        which makes this place the connecting link between the great iron-works at
        and near Merthyr Tydvil, and with the English and foreign markets, was undertaken
        in the year 1790. It commences at the sea-lock below the town, passing the
        e. entrance by tbe old gateway by means of a tunnel. Leaving Llandaff on the
        w., it may be traced among the mountains, sometimes on one side of the Taff,
        and sometimes on the other. After passing Pont-y-Prydd, and before we reach
        the Quaker''s Yard, observe a branch turns to the 1., to the iron- works of
        Aberdare. The fall from Merthyr Tydvil to Cardiff, is nearly 600 ft., requiring
        40 locks and as many bridges. The extent is 26 m. The Taap Vale Railway is
        progressing very favourably, and it is stated by those most competent to give
        an opinion on the subject, that it will shortly be opened as far as Quakers''
        Yard from Cardiff, so that all the coal now brought down the Glamorganshire
        Canal for shipment, will then be conveyed by this superior mode of transit.
        The Bute Ship Canal will be completed by about the same time, and it is confidently
        anticipated that these two great undertakings will contribute to place Cardiff
        in a much more important position as a maritime town than it stands at present.
        The tramroad from Tredegar, &c. to Newport, has a capital of 400,000/. invested
        in it, and yet pays a dividend of 10 per cent, per annum, although the vein
        of coal in that valley does not exceed 3 ft. in thickness, whilst the veins
        in] the vale of Taff, exceed 40 ft., and are inexhaustible for centuries to
        come. The extension of the privilege of warehousing at the port of Cardiff,
        to all goods except silk and tobacco, has lately been granted by the Lords
        of the Treasury. AVithin the present year, a first-rate harbour capable of
        receiving vessels of 600 tons burden, will probably be completed, affording
        every accommodation for the mercantile interest, capable of being devised
        by the ingenuity of man or the outlay of almost unlimited capital. The Glamorganshire
        and Monmouth Infirmary and Dispensary is si tuated here.', 1]

        \ that the second great navigator, Thorwold, assailed the natives without\
        \ cause ; but in using the sword he perished by the sword. On receiving a\
        \ mortal wound, he requested that after his death crosses might be placed\
        \ at either end of his grave. The Catholic ministers in giving an account\
        \ of their first missionary labors in this country, speak of the custom of\
        \ the natives in wearing crosses. Such must have been introduced by the Northmen\
        \ christians. I mentioned this circumstance lately to the Librarian of the\
        \ Ameri can Antiquarian Society, Worcester, and he said that a cross had been\
        \ sent to that institution, by a gentleman of Ohio. I saw this emblem of the\
        \ christian faith. It must have been hid from the light of heaven for centuries.\
        \ This silver cross is about two and a half inches long. It was found on the\
        \ breast of a female skeleton \u2014 one which was dug from a mound at Columbus\
        \ over which a forest of trees had grown. On this cross the capital letters\
        \ I. S. are perfectly visible. And what can these letters imply but the initials\
        \ of the sacred name Iesus Sal- VATOR ? Who can doubt, then, but that the\
        \ \" Sun of Righteousness\" cast his bright beams on the land west of the\
        \ dread Atlantic long before the time of Columbus ? In 1006, Thorfins, or\
        \ Thorfin, commanded one of the three ships that came from Iceland to Greenland.\
        \ He was of royal lineage. In the spring of 1007, Thorfin, with three ships\
        \ and one hundred and sixty men, besides cattle and all necessary materials\
        \ for establishing a colony, set sail for Vinland. They sailed to Helluland\
        \ or Labrador ; from thence to Markland or Nova Scotia ; and from thence to\
        \ Kjarlanes, or Cape Cod. Sailing south by the east side of the promontory,\
        \ which terminated at Kjarlanes, they passed along beaches or trackless deserts\
        \ of sand. How descrip tive of this bleak and steril coast. Those who have\
        \ sailed from Boston to Narragansett Bay, are ready to say, that I am not\
        \ drawing an ideal picture. Continuing their course, they arrived at an island\
        \ between which and the main land a stream appeared to pass. They called it\
        \ Shaumey. This is supposed to be Martha's Vineyard. Nine men went away in\
        \ one of the ships and never returned. It is said they were driven on the\
        \ coast of Ireland where they were seized as slaves. In the spring, Thorfin\
        \ and one hundred and fifty-one others went to the main land. They called\
        \ the place Hop, the residence afterwards of king Philip. Here they found\
        \ large numbers of skrellings or natives. Thorfin carried on a traffic with\
        \ them by exchanging bits of colored cloth for furs. In consequence of their\
        \ frequent attacks, in 1009, they returned to Greenland. Then it will be recollected\
        \ that the Northmen had not the use of fire-arms, with which to defend themselves\
        \ against the assaults of the savages. These lords of the wilds had a rude\
        \ kind of engine by which they hurled large stones against their foes ; and\
        \ it is possible that the white man would never have driven the red man from\
        \ the Atlantic to the Rocky mountains, but for the invention of gun powder.",

    - ["9 DISCOVERY OF AMERICA. 1st. Are these documents genuine ? 2d. If so, why\
        \ have they not been heard of before ? The work itself contains evidences\
        \ of the antiquity and authenticity of the manuscripts from which the publication\
        \ has been made, sufficient to raise them above any just suspicion. These\
        \ documents, as Professor Rafn says, have been known to Ice landic scholars,\
        \ but these have been so few, comparatively, and the means of these few so\
        \ limited, that they have not been able to give them suitable examination,\
        \ much less to be at the expense of publish ing them. How long did the ancient\
        \ classics, for instance, lay concealed in the monasteries of Europe, for\
        \ the want of some one to exhibit them to public view ? These Icelandic documents\
        \ may have been hid in like man ner, in the libraries of priests. And we may\
        \ say that the Society of Antiquarians in Copenhagen, in bringing these documents\
        \ to light, resembles the eonduct of the poet Laureate, Petrarch, in the fourteenth\
        \ century, who at his own expense, had the valuable manuscripts of anti quity\
        \ dragged from the dust of the cloisters, transcribed and exhibited to the\
        \ world. Who does not admire the lovely scenery, where the beautiful and sublime\
        \ are blended, displayed in the succession of falls at Trenton ? Yet these\
        \ were concealed for ages, till a master-spirit revealed them to an admiring\
        \ world ! And does not the raven wing of night hide the works of art also\
        \ till disclosed in a similar way ? The learned of Ice- land, though like\
        \ the generality of poets, were poor, yet they were not disposed, like Milton,\
        \ to sell their manuscripts for a paltry sum. It is well known the Norwegians\
        \ have long claimed the honor of dis- covering and colonizing America before\
        \ the time of Columbus. Instead of this discovery being a new fangled theory,\
        \ as some say, there have been several works published in Europe, upwards\
        \ of a cen- tury, which speak of these facts. Wormius speaks of this discovery,\
        \ in a Latin translation published at the University of Oxford, in or about\
        \ 1716. In Adam of Bremen's account, published 1629, he uses the fol lowing\
        \ striking language ; \" non fabulosa opinione sed certa relatione Danorum,\"\
        \ that is, in a free translation, \" this is not a fabulous opinion, but a\
        \ true narrative given by the Danes themselves.\" Dr. Franklin in a letter\
        \ to a distinguished antiquary formerly of Switzerland, says posi- tively,\
        \ that the Danes came into New England before the time of Col- umbus. The\
        \ celebrated Dr. Henderson, who travelled in Iceland, says, that the fact\
        \ of this early discovery was well known to the Icelanders, \u2014 that it\
        \ was authenticated by northern historians. It is a remarkable fact, that\
        \ Iceland, where these documents relating to the early discove ry, were preserved,\
        \ was the Athens of the North during the dark ages. During the middle ages,\
        \ the Icelanders were the most intelligent peo ple in the North. Even now,\
        \ as Henderson says, youth can repeat passages from Latin and Greek authors,\
        \ who have never been but a few miles from the place of their birth. And the\
        \ hardy Icelanders were our librarians and historians. Iceland appears to\

        \ was ap- pointed attorney- gene ral of the Palatinate of Tip- perary, under\
        \ the Duke of Ormond. He was a man i of talents, and appears to have possessed\

        \ his brethren, William', Jonathan, and Adam, all of whom settled in that\
        \ kingdom, and there lived and died. Jonathan Swift, the father of the celebrated\

        \ wrestler ofhis time, as Janus Panonius, bishop of five churches, has remarked\
        \ in an epigram. \" Wherefore Louis XI , having heard of this great prodigy\
        \ of learning, grew somewhat jealous of Mat thias Corvinus, who had chosen\
        \ him for his master, and the companion of his studies ; aud, moved by an\
        \ honourable emulation, made proposals to him of so much advantage, that he\
        \ determined at length on quitting Hungary, to the end that he might better\

        \ by his merits, and breathe in all comfort the air of France, under the savour\
        \ and liberality of so powerful a king. But by a strange misfortune, on his\
        \ arrival at Lyons, where the King was, in the year 1476, he was so surprised\
        \ by the suddenness of the meeting that in his hurry to alight, in order lo\
        \ salute him, he fell from his horse with great violence, that he broke his\
        \ neck and died on the spot. The learned Joannes Valerianus, from whom we\

        \ 1 have pointed out as being paid a good deal than the value oi their services,\
        \ arc ofa contrary opinion, l,t them defend theinsches. Those who \" pay the\

        20, given to James Henderson, late Taskmaster ot Morpeth Gaol, upon quitting\
        \ that office, to be inadequate to the claims which J. II. can advance for\
        \ past services. J. H., it appears, has been a servant to the county during\
        \ 20 years. The accounts show that he was paid 80 guineas salary pet annum.\
        \ Therelore vou may decide upon the justice of an annuity being granted to\
        \ him\u2014 as Mr. Robson says he ought to have an annuity. Mr. Henderson\
        \ complains ol having been discharged without a just cause. I am ignorant\
        \ of the real ciuse which induced the Justices to dismiss him. If the Ma gistrates,\
        \ in their capacity of Municipal Councillors, dismissed Henderson without\
        \ a cause, it affords another proof of the danger of being tried before an\

        \ train of the Brandling- Junction Railway, from Sunderland, was coming to\
        \ Gateshead on Mon- day, Sept. 21, and had arrived near to where the Park\
        \ Lane crosses the line, about hall a mile from the Gaieshead station, j e\
        \ cart and horse, belonging to Mr. Mould, and driven by a very deaf old man,\
        \ came up at the time; and the man not perceiving the train approaching, and\
        \ not being able to hear the whistle, which was blown as loudly as possible,\
        \ drove his cart across ; when, before the engine could be stopped, they came\
        \ in violent contact, by which the old man had his leg broken, the cart was\
        \ destroyed, and the horse killed. The old ijan died yesterday. J. Clayton,\
        \ Esq., presided on tbe 25th Sept. at a qtiar- ! terly meeting of the subscribers\
        \ to the Victoria Blind Asylum, Newcastle; and Mr. Joseph Watson read a Report,\
        \ from which it appeared that the receipts of the past three months had been\
        \ \xA3114 5s., (being 15s. beyond the receipts of the whole of last year).\
        \ The children read and sung ; and the persons present were ! \"much amused\
        \ by the exhibition of a letter which had passed between two of the blind\
        \ youths, the communication consisting ol a ball of twine, knotted in such\
        \ a manner as to convey the sentiments of the writer. Thanks were voted to\

        \ ol Jauies Edgecome, Esq.,) toJ. Grote Esq., and Capt. Weatheiley, for their\

        \ express our acknowledgments to a respected correspondent, for the following\
        \ most interesting letter: \u2014 Queen Hotel, Harrogate, Sept. 23. Simply\
        \ to amuse i9 my sole pretence, For here no strictures are to give ofience.\
        \ Those who have not visited the delightful watering-place of Harrogate for\
        \ the last eight or ten years, will find this locale greatly improved in several\
        \ important respects. For instance, there are two new churches: the old chapel\
        \ of St. John's, in High Harrogate, which formerly was the only place where\
        \ divine service was performed, was pulled down in 1831, and a handsome and\
        \ commodious structure,called Christen urch stands on its site, capable ot\
        \ holding 1^00 persons. At Low' Harrogate, six years ago, the church of St.\
        \ Mary's was erected. It is a plain, neat edifice, and contains seats for\
        \ 800. There are also two chapels for Dissenting congregations\u2014 that\
        \ called the Independent chapel was built in 1831. Except the facade, the\
        \ whole of this chapel was constructed and fitted up from the materials that\
        \ formerly comprised St. John's chapel in High Harrogate, namely, the pulpit,\
        \ the pews, the bell, &c All thi- is as it should be, unquestionably, considering\
        \ the great in- crease of the number of inhabitants during the last ten years.\
        \ In 1831, the population of Harrogate was only 2,812 : at pre- sent, the\
        \ number of adults and children is estimated in round numbers at 5,000. It\
        \ is also satisfactory to state that due pro vision is made for educ i! ioual\

        \ ASYLUM FOR THE BLIND. EXCURSION OF THE INMATES TO TYNEMOUTH BY EAILWAY.\
        \ The Directors ofthe Newcastle and North Shields Railway Company having generously\
        \ offered to convey the inmates o'f this asylum to and from Shields, free\
        \ of charge, the blind (twenty in number), accompanied by the master and matron\
        \ and the servants, left Newcastle in the train at half-past ten o clock on\
        \ Thursday morning, Sept. 10. The clean and neat ap pearance of the children,\
        \ and their orderly behaviour, attracted much attention as they passed along\
        \ the streets osNorth Shields At Tynemouth, they enjoyed a substantial dinner\
        \ at the Salu- i tation inn, and afterwards partook of a dessert, furnished\
        \ to them by the kindness of Capt. Weatherley and his lady, who, i by their\
        \ attention to the children during the day, added greatly to their pleasure.\
        \ After dinner, they adjourned to the sea shore, ! where one of their blind\
        \ teachers played seveial spirited airs on the union-pipes. Some of the boys\
        \ were rowed about in the haven, greatly to their delight. One little fellow,\
        \ on landing, thought he must have been to the middle ol the sea, and wished\
        \ I that they had taken him to the other side. Others expressed their surprise\
        \ at the water tasting so salt. All had inquiries to make respecting some\
        \ new object (if we may so speak) which was presented to their observation.\
        \ They afterwards visited the castle-yard, where the sergeant of the guard,\
        \ and several of the soldiers ol the 95th Regiment, showed great interest\
        \ in them, giving them information respecting the instruments ol war placed\
        \ in the garrison\u2014 guiding their hands along the gieat guns\u2014 explaining\
        \ the construction of the smaller weapons\u2014 and ; permitting them to snap\
        \ two muskets\u2014 a feat of which the per- formers seemed very proud. i\
        \ In the evening, they were conducted to the George tavern in North Shields,\
        \ where tea was provided for them, and where ar- rangements had been made\
        \ for holding a public meeting. They were here joined by Joseph Grote, Esq.,\
        \ and Xlessrs. James Finlay, T. M. Greenhow, antl Joseph Watson, members of\
        \ the committee. The attendance was very numerous and respect- able, the assembly-room\
        \ being crowded. On the motion ot Robert Spence, Esq., Mr. Grote was called\
        \ to the chair, and ;\u25A0 opened the business ofthe meetine by explaining\
        \ the establish- ment of the institution, and the system of instruction pursued\
        \ at the asylum. The children joined in singing, \" Before Jeho- vah's awful\
        \ throne,\" accompanied by their teacher (himself being blind) on the piano-forte\u2014\
        \ a beautilul instrument, which was lent gratuitously for the occasion by\
        \ Xlessrs. Greenwell. Mr. Greenhow then addressed the meeting on the benefits\
        \ reJ suiting to the blind Irom the formation ot such institutions, and contrasted\
        \ the advantages which the inmates possessed' over those ol their alliicted\
        \ brethren, who had not tbe opportu- nity ol instruction. Alter the singing\
        \ of another hymn, some ofthe little boys, who have been but a short time\
        \ in the asylum, exhibited their mode of learning to read. They then again\
        \ united in singing a hymn, viz., Come let us join tbe tuneful throng Of angels\
        \ round the tbrone. The elder girls read portions of the Scriptures, and the\
        \ meeting ended with the National Anthem. The company testified their gratification\
        \ by frequently ap- plauding the children. The facility and correctness with\
        \ which the elder girls read, especially seemed, to excite their astonish-\
        \ ment. The Rev. A. Jack and Mr. Spence expressed the grati- fication with\
        \ which they had witnessed the proceedings of the evening. Several gentlemen\
        \ recommended that a collection should be made for the funds of the institution,\
        \ and a liberal subscription was made ; besides which, many enrolled their\
        \ names as annual subscribers, and a number of articles, manu- factured at\
        \ the asylum in the Spital, were disposed of. AT the ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\

        \ room, worthy of the present improved circumstances of our borough. Mr. Freeman's\

        \ an Exhibition of Works of Art, Models of Machinery. Ste., for the joint\

        \ statements, which were, on the whole, ofa very gratifying cha racter ; and\
        \ having made a few gallant observations in reference to the presence, for\
        \ the first time, of the ladies, at the Society's anniversary, Mr. Brockett\
        \ concluded by moving that the Report, with the Accounts, be received and\
        \ adopted. W. L. Harle, Esq., seconded the motion \u2014 and intimated, that\
        \ in the forthcoming Exhibition, the famous Jacquard loom would be included,\
        \ with many other wonders of mechanism, never before introduced into this\
        \ district. Mr. Harle exhorted the member* to contribute to the Exhibition\
        \ whatever they possessed of the rare and the curious, and took occasion to\
        \ pay a compliment to Mr. Brady as the originator of tbe project \u2014 [To\
        \ Mr. Brady, eroat merit is due, for his unceasing exertions to promote the\
        \ Exhibition. He it was, we understand, who first suggested the project; and\
        \ as one of the Secretaries, his services will be invaluable in its execution\
        \ ; but we must claim for the Observer, that, without any idea that such a\
        \ scheme was occupying the mind of any person in the district, it came forward\
        \ to agitate the propriety of following the example of Leeds, Manchester,\
        \ &e., and gave an impulse to the Mechanics' Institutes ol Newcastle and Gateshead,\
        \ which was not com municated in vain.] \u2014 The motion having been carried,\
        \ Joseph Willis, Esq., moved a vote of thanks to the Committee, which was\
        \ seconded by Mr. Aid. Pollock, and cordially passed. Mr. Swinburne, as Treasurer,\
        \ acknowledged the honour conferred upon himself and his colleagues; and then\
        \ proceeded, with much good humour, to return the compliment, by lecturing\
        \ the members of the institution, for their scanty attendance at the monthly\
        \ meetings. On some occasions, there was not even a quorum, and no business\
        \ could be done. \u2014 Mr. Joseph Clephan was now called upon to move certain\
        \ alterations in the rules, of which he had given notice. These alterations\
        \ had for their object, 1st, to give greater facility to the admission of\
        \ mem bers; 2dly, to facilitate the admission of members' friends. non. resident,\
        \ to the temporary use of the reading-room ; and, 3dly, to abolish the regulation\
        \ prohibiting the presence ol strangers at the annual meeting. \u2014 These\
        \ alterations having been adopted, and the members having handed-in their\
        \ voting papers, Mr. Willis moved a vote of thanks to the Chairman, which\
        \ was passed by acclamation. Mr. Hutt thanked the meeting for the compliment\
        \ which they had paid to him, and congratulated the members on the prosperous\
        \ condition of the institution. The Hon. Member then referred to the absurd\
        \ notion, that discontent and disorder flowed from popular educa tion ; and\
        \ as proof to the contrary, stated, that the Liverpool Mechanics' Institute,\
        \ which numbered 1,500 members, and had been in existence about twenty years,\
        \ had not on its books the name of one single individual that had ever been\
        \ belore a court of justice as a criminal, or (with two exceptions) that had\
        \ ever been connected with any union or strikes. It was not the edu |cated,(said\
        \ Mr. Hutt,) but the ignorant, to whom the appeals of political adventurers\
        \ were made. Laws, as little open to reproach as those which regulated the\
        \ motions of the planets, had been successfully represented as crying grievances,\
        \ and perverted into sources of disaffection, by political auaeks, who had\

        faith of nis fathers, and he is forthwith pronounced intolerant and perse
        cuting, winch have ever been the watchwords of empirics and fana ticism. No
        sooner had the presbyterians under Cromwell secured themselves in the government,
        than they published divers treatises against toleration; many of them, who
        formerly complained that they had not sufficient freedom under episcopacy,
        could not forbear crying out against " this cursed intolerable toleration."
        The direful effects of which may be further learnt by perusing the life of
        J. Shaw, vicar of Rotheram, in this reign of professing aberration. The theological
        warfare of that period, like most others before or since, was not. more remarkable
        for its jargon and uumeaningness, than the bitterness and rancor with which
        it was conducted. The two chief leaders in this matter, were Dr. Owen and
        the noted Baxter ; and their never-ending but incomprehensible theme, whe
        ther the death of Christ was a debt which by law we ought to have paid, or
        a result amounting to the same thing. Many a sincere believer in the Christian
        dispensation has been persecuted as an infidel, for endeavoring to restrain
        these addle-headed fanatics within the bounds of common sense. The foregoing,
        with much more further on, is a glossary upon liberty of conscience in this
        land, or we ought rather to say, the propagation of opinions not less offen
        sive to the minds of men, than they are a mockery and insulting to the majesty
        of heaven. Hutchinson''s History of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, published
        in 1760, and his letters on the same subject a few years after, represent
        these people in another and exceedingly odious light. The rule Audi alteram
        partem, or hear both sides, not answering the purpose of these sectarians,
        never appears in any of their denunciations ; to which I would reply, by referring
        the reader to their own recorded deeds in the land of their adoption. How
        much soever these men may have been deficient in a right system of theology,
        or sound one of ethics, still they had sufficient sense to know, that when
        it is determined to sacrifice another, fuel enough may be found under any
        tree to kindle a fire for doinf so. To such procedure, whether its discomfiture
        depends or not upon myself, I most unequivocally apply my veto, or I forbid
        it; (which was first used by the tribunes of ancient Rome, when they disapproved
        a decree of the senate, and, on the contrary if accepting it, did so by signing
        the letter T.) A well-written parallel between the ancient and modern fanatics,
        is to be found in the seventh volume of the Harleian Miscellany, edited by^Oldys,
        author of the British Librarian, a book, though slightly rusticated by age,
        that should be possessed by every well wisher to literature. When the initials

        and are without capitals, the arches springing from the shaft. We were speak-
        ing of this peculiarity afterwards in a bookseller''s shop hard by, the owner
        of which had exhibited great interest in our opinion ; but he evidently thought
        we were depreciating the beauties of his cathedral by the remark, and with
        great impor- tance remarked that though there might be no capitals to the
        columns on ordinary occasions, " C''est possible qu''on ne les met que les
        jours de fete." The old church of St. Croix, a relic of the 9th century, is
        in very good preservation, though the interior is disfigured by being covered
        with a bright yellow wash. There is some curious sculp ture over the western
        entrance, but only a portion of the original door now remains. We were desirous
        of seeing the public li brary, and proceeded to the college where it is situated.
        The librarian was just gone, but one of the professors who was standing in
        the court-yard, and became aware of our wishes, in formed us where he lived,
        and though he ad mitted that there were no manuscripts and few books, he added
        that our wishes would, no doubt, be gratified. This mode of expressing himself
        was characteristic of his nation : " Monsieur," said', 1]

        " c''est un plaisir. Madame," he added, turning to me, " c''est un devoir."
        The distinction was nicely drawn. We found the librarian a very obliging agree
        able man ; he regretted that he had nothing to show us worthy our attention,
        and explained that when Napoleon restored order to the churches and public
        edifices after the Revolution, he cen tralized all the manuscripts and choicest
        books in the public library at Avranches. To us this was no disappointment,
        for thither we were bound. We inquired respecting a cartulary called the "
        Livre Vert," of which we had formerly heard, and found that it had answered
        at least one good purpose. A certain abbe of the diocese was, a few years
        since, at variance with his suffragan and brother canons, and nothing could
        heal the difference : they even threatened him with ex pulsion from their
        community. When things were at the worst, the abbe luckily stumbled upon the
        Livre Vert, and finding it to contain much which threw disrepute upon many
        of the acts of the former clergy of the diocese, and un folded many secrets
        which it was desirable should not be made known, he threatened to publish
        the volume. This brought the chapter to reason,', 1]

        \ of slender columns which support the roof, the de licacy of the sculpture,\
        \ and the beauty of the stained glass, produce an effect that is not ex ceeded,\
        \ and scarcely equalled in any cathedral in France. As to the town of Coutances,\
        \ we quitted it without regret ; it is close, dirty, and irregular ; and when\

        \ smoke, noise, and dreariness of the interior of this mass of buildings,\
        \ with the total absence of female society, gives it, in no small degree,\
        \ the aspect of a prison. The front rooms, however, are pleasant, and some\
        \ of them have fine promenades on tbe roof. An open space in front, about\
        \ one hundred yards long and fifty wide, serves both as a wharf and a promenade.\
        \ But the first of these uses obstructs it for the other ; to say nothing\
        \ of barbers, cooks, pedlars, clothes-menders, coolies, and boatmen, who crowd\
        \ it most of the day. I was kindly made welcome to the American hong, or,\
        \ as the Chinese call it, the \" hong of extensive foun tains,\" where at\
        \ the table of the American missionaries, and of Messrs Oliphant and Co.,\
        \ I enjoyed, for several week. , daily opportunities of acquiring authentic\
        \ infor mation, on all the points which concern my agency. Fortunately for\
        \ me, there existed, during my stay in Canton, no particular jealousy of foreigners.\
        \ Accom panying the missionaries and other gentlemen in their daily walks\
        \ for exercise, I was enabled to ramble not only over all the suburbs, but\
        \ among the villages and fields adjacent. We were not specially ill treated,\
        \ but I have nowhere else found quite so much scorn and rudeness. Nearly all\
        \ the time, some of the youngsters would be calling out as we passed, \" Foreign\
        \ devils !\" \"barbarians!\" \"red-bristled devils!\" \u2014 often adding\
        \ obscene expressions, and sometimes throwing light mis siles; all which the\
        \ parents seemed to think very clever. Often, indeed, they would direct the\
        \ attention of very small children to us, and teach them to rail. Our clerical\
        \ profession seemed known to many ; and these would shout \"Story- telling\
        \ devils !\" \"he-preaching devils !\" In streets much frequented by foreigners,\
        \ these things rarely occurred, but in others we attracted general attention\
        \ ; and if we stopped for a few moments, a crowd would immediately choke up\
        \ the street. Some times Dr Parker's patients would recognise him, and we\
        \ would be asked to sit down ; tea and pipes would be offered, and a strong\
        \ sense of confidence and gratitude manifested. But the crowd would soon become\
        \ dis agreeable, and we were glad to pass on to get fresh, air, and to exempt\
        \ our friends from annoyance. The width of the streets is seldom more than\
        \ four or five feet, and often less. The houses rarely exceed one story high;\
        \ and, except on business streets, all the better ones are invisible, being\
        \ built, like those of Paris, within a walled enclosure. The streets are all\
        \ flagged with large slabs of smooth stone, principally granite. The breadth\
        \ excludes wheel carriages, of course, and the only vehicles are sedan chairs,\
        \ which are constantly gliding along at a very rapid rate ; those for ladies\
        \ being closed with blinds, or gauze, but not so as to prevent the occupant\
        \ from looking through. As these chairs, or loaded coolies, come rushiug along,\
        \ a perpetual shouting is kept up to clear the way ; and unless you jump to\
        \ the wall or into a shop, you are rudely jostled, for though they are polite\
        \ and kind, their headway and heavy burden render it impossible to make sudden\
        \ pauses. As to walking arm in arm, it is quite out of the question. 1 saw\
        \ none of the unbroken ranges of piazza spoken of by geographers ; but in\
        \ some places mats are spread across the street, which exclude the sun. The\
        \ end of each street has a strong gate, which is shut up at night, chiefly\
        \ for security against thieves. The shops are often truly beautiful, but the\
        \ greater number are occupied as well by the workmen as the wares. Such minute\
        \ subdivision of callings I bave seen nowhere else. Not only are trades subdivided\
        \ into the most minute branches, but the shops are often limited to one or\
        \ two species of goods. Some of those which I entered would vie with those\
        \ of London for style and amount of capital invested. In each, the idol has\
        \ a handsome and conspicuous situation. As Chinese is read perpendicularly,\
        \ the sign-boards are suspended downward, and are thus well adapted to narrow\
        \ streets. They are generally beautifully executed, and often, after announcing\
        \ the name and occupation, close with sage sentences ; such as, \"Gossipping\
        \ and long sitting injure Many trades are here perambulatory, which are so\
        \ nowhere else. Among these moving mechanics I noticed barbers, coopers, tinmen,\
        \ blacksmiths, shoemakers, and tailors, besides a medley of fruiterers, hucksters,\
        \ fish mongers, confectioners, pedlars, rat-catchers, pastry cooks, butchers,\
        \ picture-men, and I know not what. The throng and confusion of these narrow\
        \ streets is thus much increased, while their various bells, drums, gongs,\
        \ and cries, keep up a perpetual din. In these walks I observed, what I believe\
        \ is not to be seen in any part of India, regular native booksellers. They\
        \ generally display a considerable assortment of works, at astonishingly cheap\
        \ prices. The moral ten dency of these works is said to be in general good,\
        \ but the intellectual benefit is 6mall. This was often illus trated by the\
        \ close proximity of some grey-bearded for tune-teller, with five times the\
        \ custom of his literary neighbour. I was often amused to see the ludicrous\
        \ gravity with which these men of destiny drew wonder and cash from their\
        \ gaping patients, and to mai k the diversified countenances of those who\
        \ retired. The dole ful, drawmouth visage, or the arch chuckle and rubbed\
        \ hands, plainly told which had received \" dampers,\" and which brought off\
        \ animating assurances. As usual, these worshippers of fortune seemed to be\
        \ those she had hitherto least favoured. Besides, the bookstores are circulating\
        \ libraries, in the literal sense of the term ; that is, the librarian, having\
        \ his books arranged in two neat cases, bears them on a pole across his shoulder\
        \ from customer to custo mer. Some of these have several thousand books ;\
        \ but the greater part being in the hands of borrowers, his burden is not\
        \ excessive. A tolerable idea of Chinese geography may be gathered from a\
        \ glance at their maps. Mr Gutzlaff was kind enough to present me with one\
        \ of the world, and to translate many of the names. It is two feet wide by\
        \ three and a half high, and is almost covered with China ! In the left hand\

        \ Holland is as large as all st and Africa is not so big as the end of one's\
        \ little finger ! The northern frontier is Russia, very large. The left corner,\
        \ at the bottom, is occupied by \"the western ocean,\" as it is called, containing\
        \ the Malay peninsula pretty well defined. Along the bottom are Camboja, Cochin-China,\
        \ &c, represented as moderate sized islands, and on the right is Formosa,\
        \ larger than all the rest put together. Various other countries are shown\
        \ as small islands. I should have given an en graving of this curious map,\
        \ but that a true reduction to the size of a page would have left out most\

        \ we are assured, that, notwithstanding these additional competitors, the\
        \ successors of Mr Tullis do as much business as he did. There are at present\
        \ in Cupar two printing establishments, that of the successors of Mr Tullis,\
        \ at which the Fife Herald is printed, and that of the pro prietors of the\

        \ it would be a great neglect not to state that the late Mr Tullis was many\
        \ years printer to the university of St Andrews; and as such printed the greater\
        \ number of those famed, and it may be well said immaculate, editions of the\
        \ Latin classics, edited by Professor Hunter of that university. It is not\
        \ our duty at present to speak of Dr Hunter's excellence as an editor, or\

        of its alumni soon distinguished themselves, by their abilities and zeal,
        in the cause of orthodox unity. Joseph Velamani, for instance, during his

        of all the Russias, converted, it is said, no less than two millions of souls
        to the true faith. The Grecian College in Rome, also, gave two Librarians
        to the Vatican, in the persons of Leo Allatius, and Nicholas Alemanni, names
        that, in their day, were second to none in the republic of letters. The Greek
        Church contains nothing particularly deserving of notice, but the contiguous

        manu scripts.', 1]

        of St. Paul''s Church, by the Right Rev. B. T. Onderdonk, Bishop of the Diocese.
        From the church records we extract the following memoranda, 3 October 1833,
        "a meeting of Episcopalians residing in this vil lage and vicinity, was held
        at the house of Mr. Caleb Bacon, who resolved to form themselves into a society
        for the purpose under Divine favor and assistance of forming a church in said
        village ; and that we will communicate with our Episcopal friends and neighbors
        on the subject, and urge by our best efforts their co-ope ration in the good
        work." This is signed by George W. Cart wright, William Darjue, John Barlow,
        C. Bacon and John Strang; they also agreed to write to the Rev. Mr. Jelliff
        of North Salem, who has expressed a wish to aid in establishing a church with
        us." Previous to this date there had been occasional services held at some
        private house, when a clergyman of the church happened to be in the village
        or vicinity. In 1833 there were reported to be twenty-four heads of families
        with an aggregate of one hundred and thirty -six souls belonging to the Episcopal
        church. November 11th 1833, the first election of officers took place. December

        \ The epithet of Martel, the Hammer, which has been added to the name of Charles,\

        \ provoked to turn their arms against each other : the remains of their host\

        \ was suspected by the victorious Christians : on the report of their spies,\
        \ they ventured to explore the riches of the vacant tents ; but, if we except\
        \ some celebrated relics, a small portion of the spoil was restored to the\

        and his clergy, barefoot, in sackcloth and ashes ; the songs of triumph were
        modulated to psalms and litanies; the walls were besprinkled with holy water
        ; and the ceremony was concluded with a prayer, that under the guardian care

        of these expeditions he penetrated into Syria, and besieged the obscure town
        of Sozopetra ; the casual birthplace of the caliph Motassem, whose father
        Harun was attended in peace or war by the most favoured of his wives and concubines.
        The revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that moment the arms of the Saracen,
        and he could only intercede in favour of a place for which he felt and acknowledged
        some de gree of filial affection. These solicitations determined the emperor
        to wound his pride in so sensible a part. Sozopetra was levelled with the
        ground, the Syrian prisoners were marked or mutilated with ignominious cruelty,
        and a thousand female captives were forced away from the adjacent territory.
        Among these a matron of the house of Abbas invoked, in an agony of despair,
        the name of Motassem ; and the insults of the Greeks engaged the honour of
        her kinsman to avenge his in- 1 The Arabs and the Greeks are alike silent

        supposed to have become acquainted with the doctrines of Wickliffe. One of
        the students, seeing I was a stranger, politely showed me into the library.

        keys and a black gown, beck oned me to explore with him its rich treasures,
        There was one of the first Bibles ever printed ; and there were the celebrated
        theses of John Huss in his own handwriting. But the most interesting relic
        of all, was a manuscript Hussite liturgy discov ered, as the librarian told
        me, in destroying one of their ancient places of worship. It was found to
        have been executed at the cost of the different trade-companies of the city,
        and was beau tifully illuminated with paintings, the subjects of which were
        taken mostly from the Bible and die life of Huss. One series of these illustrations
        was very remarkable. It consisted of three small pictures on die margin of
        die same page, represcntiiior the progress of the Reformation. The first represented
        Wickliffe, striking a spark with flint and steel ; the second Huss, blowincr
        a little kindling fire ; and the third Luther, holding up a blazino torch.

        \ may venture lo give you an anticipation in brief of the building whose first\

        \ architecture that prevailed some six centuries ago, chiefly in Germany,\
        \ Normandy, and Southern Europe, which preceded the Gothic, and continues\
        \ to recommend itself, for structures like this, to the most enlightened judgment.\
        \ It is known as the Norman, or, more strict ly speaking, the Lombard style.\
        \ It harmonizes alike with the extent, the grave uses, and the massive strength\
        \ of the edifice ; it exacts a certain variety in the forms of its parts ;\
        \ and it authorizes any additions that convenience may require, no matter\
        \ how seemingly irregular they may be. It will extend, east and west, an entire\
        \ front of four hundred and twenty-six feet, having a central building of\
        \ fifty by two hundred feet in the clear, inside, with two towers ; two wings\
        \ of unequal fronts ; the east one forty-five by seventy-five feet in the\
        \ clear, inside, with a vestibule and porch attached to it; the west one thirty-four\
        \ by sixty-five feet in the clear, inside, with a northern semi-circular pro\
        \ jection. These wings will be connected with the central building by two\
        \ ranges sixty feet in length in the clear, inside. It will have a central\
        \ rear tower, and other towers of different heights, sizes, and characters,\
        \ two of them placed in the wings. All these numerous towers are essential\
        \ to arrangements within \u2014 as flues, stairways, ventilators, and detached\
        \ rooms \u2014 and are of different heights, varying from sixty to one hundred\

        \ carry out this plan, the income of the Institution is to be divided into\
        \ two equal parts : \u2014 One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse\

        \ before given ; the other part to be appropriated to the increase and diffusion\
        \ of knowledge by means of collections of books, and objects of nature and\
        \ art. For the library, $20,000 have been appropriated, as a beginning. For\
        \ philosophical and chemical apparatus, $4,000. A series of resolutions have\
        \ been passed, of the following purport : \u2014 Resolved, That the Secretaries\
        \ of State, of the Treasury, of War, and of the Navy of the United States,\
        \ be respectfully invited to furnish to consuls, and other public officers\
        \ in this and foreign countries, under their respective departments, such\
        \ suggestions as they may deem proper in regard to the procurement, as op\

        \ to each the name of the officer or agent through whom the same may be procured,\
        \ or the name and residence ofthe donor. Officers. \u2014 Under this plan,\
        \ at least three officers will ultimately be required. 1st. The Secretary,\
        \ whose duty, besides general superintendence, will be, to act as Professor\
        \ of General Physics ; to make original researches ; to report to the regents\
        \ annually the state of the Institution, and the re searches which have been\
        \ made ; to give an account of the memoirs which have been received for publication\
        \ ; and to edit, with the assistance ofthe other officers, the publications\
        \ ofthe Institution. 2d. The Librarian, whose duty it shall be to act as Professor\
        \ of Ethnology, to take charge of the collections of art ; and to form a library\
        \ on the plan before laid down, and to assist in editing the publications.\
        \ 3d. The Naturalist, whose duties shall be, to act as Professor of Natural\
        \ History ; to take charge of all collections in his own department ; to effect\
        \ exchanges of specimens with other institutions ; to assist in editing the\
        \ publications ; to share with the secretary as much of chemistry as re lates\
        \ to organized compounds, and to make original researches in his own line.\
        \ It should also be the duty of each officer ofthe Institution to give occa\
        \ sionally a short course of lectures on some part ofthe branches of know\
        \ ledge entrusted to his care. It shall be the duty of the secretary and assistants,\
        \ during the session of Congress, to illustrate new discoveries in science,\
        \ and to exhibit new ob jects of art. At present only one of these officers,\
        \ the secretary, will be required to take a very active part in the business\
        \ of the Institution. Professor Joseph Henry, L.L. D., of Princeton, was selected\
        \ to this office previous to the adoption of a plan of organization. The committee\
        \ felt, that upon the choice of this single officer, more, probably, than\

    - ['50 The Smithsonian Institution. indicate an intention that a portion ofthe
        annual interest should be applied to the advancement of physical science and
        the arts, in part, by lectures. 1st. With regard to the library, sufficient
        accommodation should be pro vided for 100,000 volumes, in deference rather
        to what seems a fair conces sion to the spirit ofthe charter, than to a conviction
        that a library of more than half that size could, with the present means ofthe
        Institution, advan tageously be purchased. It is important, however, that
        the Institution, at the time it is first opened, should have already in its
        library a collection of such valuable works of reference, as in the prosecution
        of its plan maybe required. But, without a vast accumulation of books, the
        librarian of the Smithsonian Institution may, under a proper system, become
        a centre of lit erary and bibliographical reference for our entire country.
        He should be instructed to procure catalogues, written or printed, of all
        important public libraries in the United States, and also, in proportion as
        they can be ob tained, printed catalogues of all the principal libraries in
        Europe, and the more important works on bibliography. With these beside him,
        he may be consulted by the scholar, the student, the author, the historian,
        from every section of the Union, and will be prepared to inform them whether
        any works they may desire to examine are to be found in the United States,
        and if so, in what library ; or, if in Europe only, in what country of Europe
        they must be sought. Informed by these catalogues, it will be easy and desirable,
        for those who may be charged with the selection of books, to make the Smithsonian
        library chiefly a supplemental one ; to purchase, for the most part, valuable
        works which are not to be found else where in the Union ; thus carrying out
        what should be a governing prin ciple, that it is expedient, as far as may
        be, to occupy untenanted ground. By this mode of collecting a library, whenever
        a particular class of works of importance is found to be specially deficient
        in the libraries of our country, the vacancy may be filled. The librarian
        might also pre serve, by entering into correspondence with the librarians
        of other coun tries, any special extract or items of information required
        by students. 2d. In relation to the museum, particular attention should be
        given to ethnology, including all collections that may supply items in the
        physical history of our species, and illustrate the manners, customs, religious
        and progressive advance of the various nations of the world ; as, for example,
        collections of shells, skeletons, portraits, dresses, implements, weapons,
        idols, antiquities of the various races of men. For this, the national col
        lection in the Patent Office affords particular advantages. Also, if the funds
        will permit, series of models illustrating the progress of some of the most
        useful inventions ; such, for example, as the steam-engine, from its earliest
        and rudest form to its present improved state ; but this only so far as it
        may not encroach on ground already covered by the numerous models already
        in the Patent Office. Also, specimens of staple materials, illus trating the
        gradual progress of our country in arts and manufactures.* 3d. As chemistry
        was the favorite study of Smithson''s life, of which a considerable portion
        was spent in his own laboratory, and as it is, without doubt, one of the most
        comprehensive and important of the nationr-1 sci ences, this department should

        the purpose of encouraging in the * It is to be hoped that the last two objects

        \ of the discovery, in 1772. The celebrated Dr. Henderson, who travelled in\
        \ Iceland, says lhat the fact of this early discovery was well known to the\
        \ Ice landers \u2014 that it was authenticated by Northern historians. It\
        \ is a remarkable fact, that Iceland, where these documents relating to the\
        \ early discovery were preserved, was the Athens of the North, during the\
        \ Dark Ages. During the Middle Ages, the Icelanders were the most intel ligent\
        \ people in the North. Even now, as Henderson says, youth can repeat passages\
        \ from Latin and Greek authors, who have never been but a few miles from the\
        \ places of their birth. Truly, the hardy Icelanders were our librarians and\
        \ historians. Iceland appears 1o have been a medium of communication between\
        \ Norway and Greenland \u2014 a stepping stone, as it were, from one continent\
        \ to another. Iceland, thought by some to be the \" Ultima Thule \" of Vir\
        \ gil, was discovered by the Norwegians in 861. The oppression of King Harold\
        \ Harfaga drove them there for an asylum. But the restless spirit of the Northmen\
        \ would not allow them to be idle. They made incursions in every direction,\
        \ and dis covered Greenland in 984. In 986, a colony was begun by Eric the\
        \ Red. This was at length destroyed. By the exertions of the Danish Society,\
        \ the ruins of this settlement have been discovered. It was located on the\
        \ West, near Cape Farwell. It is seen in the remains of churches and buildings.\
        \ Lief, the son of Eric, commenced a voyage of discovery in the year 1000.\
        \ His crew consisted of thirty-five men. Lief \"was the first to introduce\
        \ missionaries into Greenland. After sailing some time southwest, they made\
        \ land. They an chored and went ashore. This place was destitute of grass,\
        \ and wTas covered with a slaty rock, which they called Helluland. This is\
        \ supposed to be Labrador. Fishermen and travellers of the present day give\
        \ a like description of that barren region. From thence they sailed southwardly\
        \ ; and after holding on for some time, they again made land and went ashore.\
        \ This country was level, had a low coast, presenting, here and there, bluffs\
        \ of white sand, and was thickly covered with wood. This they called Markland,\
        \ or Woodland\". This is thought to be No va Scotia. Leaving Markland, they\
        \ sailed south-westerly, with a fail wind, two days before seeing land again,\
        \ when they passed down a promontory, probably the east side of Cape Cod,\
        \ stretch ing east and north ; and then turning west between an island (Martha's\
        \ Vineyard) and the main land, they entered a bay (Narragansett Bay,) through\
        \ which a river (Taunton River,)", 1]

        \ Resolving to spend the winter here, they called the place Leifsbuthir, or\
        \ place of booths. Here, finding grapes plenly, they called the place Vinland,\
        \ or Wineland the good. This land, to \u2022 those coming from the remote\
        \ North, appeared as nature in the \" world's first spring.\" Early in the\
        \ season they returned to Greenland. Lief's re turn became the principal subject\
        \ of conversation. The next adventurer was Thorwald, his brother. And you\
        \ will observe that he and the other navigators gave the same ac count of\
        \ places they visited. Were not this the case, who could believe any of their\
        \ reports ? Thorwald, thinking the country had not been sufficiently ex plored,\
        \ set sail in 1002, and proceeded to Leifsbuthir, where he lived till 1004.\
        \ In the spring of 1004, he sailed from Leifsbuthir. After pass ing along\
        \ the shore of the promontory, east and north, they sail ed round a sharp\
        \ point of land, called Kjarlanes. This must have been Cape Cod. Kjarlanes\
        \ implies Keel-cape. For Cape Cod, at the extremity, is in the shape of the\
        \ keel of ancient ves sels, which curved inward. These Northmen were peaceable\
        \ men. They were not like Ph\xE6ton, who would gladly have seized the reins\
        \ of the chariot of the sun to set the world on fire. It must not be denied,\
        \ how ever, that the second great navigator, Thorwald, assailed the natives\
        \ without a cause ; but in using the sword he perished by the sword. On receiving\
        \ a mortal wound, he requested that af ter his death, crosses might be placed\
        \ at either end of his grave. The Catholic ministers, in giving an account\
        \ of their first mis sionary labors in this country, speak of the custom of\
        \ the natives in wearing crosses. Such must have been introduced by the Northern\
        \ Christians. I mentioned this circumstance lately to the librarian of the\

        \ peopled city does not break the reigning quietude. The grass is fresh and\
        \ green in the enclosure ; and a few fragile climbing flowers wind their delicate\
        \ stems about the worn fretwork, aud nestle in the indentations of the tracery\
        \ as the shadows of their leaves tremble in the patches of light that fall\
        \ pleasantly upon the gravestones and pavement below. A marvellous city too\
        \ is commercial, every-day, common-place Ches ter \u2014 that is, if it can\
        \ be so. For the passenger's footway lies right through the first floor fronts\
        \ of the houses \u2014 which are cleared away altogether, and above the shop,\
        \ of ordinary normal position, by the road-side; and thus, the back drawing-rooms,\
        \ or whatever else they may be, are turned into more shops ; and great is\
        \ the puzzle of the stranger as to whether the road-way is down in the cellar,\
        \ or he is up stairs on the landing, or the house has turned itself out of\
        \ window ; affording a literal proof of that curious state of domestic affairs\
        \ so often spoken of. And first he fancies the ' row' \u2014 as it is termed\
        \ \u2014 is like the Quadrant, with the road exca vated a floor lower, and\
        \ shops made under the pavement ; and then it reminds him of a Thames-side\
        \ tavern, with all the shutter wainscoats, that divide the large convivial\
        \ room into so many little philandering ones, drawn away, and the windows\
        \ knocked out. And, finally, he arrives at the conclusion that there is nothing\
        \ else in the world at all Hke it, except the lithographs published by the\
        \ enterprizing librarians who live there. But very convenient is this arrangement\
        \ for old ladies of weak minds who quail at meeting cattle : and young ladies\
        \ of extrava gant ones who dote on shopping, in spite of the weather. For\
        \ it raises the first above suspicion even of danger ; and shelters the second\
        \ from being favoured with the visits of the clouds, who cannot here drop\
        \ in upon them. And so, we opine, that umbrellas are yet unknown in Chester\
        \ ; and clogs aud pattens are things to look and wonder at, worthy of a place\
        \ in the museum of the Water Tower. One only inconvenience do the rows present\
        \ : convivial gentlemen, who won't go home till morning, under ordinary social\
        \ circumstances, must be apt to descend suddenly into the valleys, which here\
        \ and there break their continuity in the shape of bye-streets. But this may\
        \ be amended Ha time by the good gentlemen, who pay such pen-and-ink attention\
        \ to the sanatory condition of large towns, and form a grotto for Hygeia at\
        \ the bottom of an inkstand. Even the chronicles of Chester are as quaint\
        \ as the place. Think of King Edward the First, when he was Here, in 1277,\
        \ ordering that every body who could spend twenty pounds a year should be\
        \ made a knight ! Why, you might have stopped at a hostelry theu, and ordered\
        \ a 'Sir' to bring you a Jack of humming ale ; or bought your hood, or jerkin,\
        \ of a real ' Lady' at the first shop you chose to turn in at. Read on, too,\
        \ how in 1356, the Mayor's feast, comprising all the delicacies of the season,\
        \ cost only eleven shillings and ten-pence ! A happy time was that for his\
        \ Lordship ; the most unrelenting, begrudging Common Council that ever assembled\
        \ would not have denied him a banquet every day had he chosen to have had\
        \ one. And some hundred years after this there was a famine ; and the people\

        \ woman's stratagem. And hollow as it was, in a measure it succeeded, for\

        \ real, living, legitimate baronet at his table, his countenance relaxed in\
        \ severity until, as well as he could do it, without compromising himself,\
        \ he fell into Mrs. Gudge's views. In order that his crooked acquiescence\
        \ might be clenched on the other side of his obstinacy, Mrs. Gudge struck\
        \ the last blow, by imme- diately sending out for some engraved invitation\
        \ paper, whicli Mr. Gudge could fill up. Resolved to do everything handsomely,\

        \ of note size, with flourishing copper-plate \" requests the &es.\" as well\
        \ as embossed borders and gilt edges. Others had paper lace round them, of\
        \ the popular top-of-a-French-plum-box design ; and one had a coloured representation,\
        \ on its first page, of a number of ladies and gentlemen of the middle ages\
        \ sitting down to a banquet in red tights\u2014 that is to say, the gentlemen\u2014\

        \ except Sir Frederick ; so Mr. Gudge went down to Richmond to see him, determined\
        \ not to allow him the chance of refusing : and in the interview drove him\
        \ into such a corner of cross-examination as to his engagements, that the\
        \ baronet was obliged to say that he would come. And as soon as all this was\

        \ of Edinburgh in 1591, and helped to complete the work which his generous\
        \ relatives had so well begun. On the election of a librarian, in the year\
        \ 1647, we find the Magistrates showing a grateful sense of their obligations\
        \ to these noble benefactors of the town, by appointing a descendant of theirs\
        \ to the office. \" Many favoured Mr Thomas Speir, son of an honest family,\
        \ laureat at the Lambas preceeding, especially in regard of his grandfather,\
        \ William Little, Provost, a most especial friend to the Colledge, and his\
        \ great grand-uncle, Mr Clement Little, com missary of Edinburgh, who gave\
        \ the first being to the library.\" 1 The house, although occupied towards\
        \ the close of last century as the Sheriff-clerk's chambers, remained an entailed\
        \ property in the possession of Clement Little's descendants, until its demolition,\
        \ and the principal carved stones are now preserved in the garden at Inch\
        \ House. According to the traditions of last century, as Creech informs us\
        \ in his Fugitive Pieces,\" this interesting old mansion formed the residence\
        \ of Cromwell during part of the time he resided in Edinburgh,2 possibly while\
        \ engaged in the siege of the Castle. This close, which bears, in the earliest\
        \ titles of property within it, the name of its old resi denter, Clement Little,\
        \ appears in Edgar's map of 1742, as Lord Cull en's Close, so that here also\
        \ resided that eminent lawyer and judge, Sir Francis Grant of Cullen, who,\
        \ in 1689, almost singly swayed the whole Scottish nation, when vacillating\
        \ between the feudal vassal lage due to the old line of kings, and their sense\
        \ of violated rights by its latest representative ; and to whose influence\
        \ was mainly owing the happy consistency of the Scottish Parliament in their\
        \ declaration that King James had, by his own act, forfeited his throne, and\
        \ left it va cant. He was raised to the bench in 1709, yet, though thus acute\
        \ on other people's matters, Lord Cullen was so utterly regardless about his\
        \ own, that his more shrewd and calculating spouse, was accustomed to have\
        \ all questions relating to his own property represented to him in the form\
        \ of a \" case ;\" and having obtained his opinion as a lawyer, she took the\
        \ advice for her direction, without troubling him with further information\
        \ as to whom it con cerned. His friend, Wodrow, has recorded in his history\
        \ the closing scene of his life, \u2014 a scene which we may associate with\
        \ the ancient alley that bore his name : \u2014 \" Brother,\" said he to one\
        \ who informed him of his mortal illness, \" you have brought me the best\
        \ news ever I heard !\" And the historian adds, in figurative depiction, \"\
        \ That day when he died was without a cloud !\" 3 The transition is great\
        \ from this single-minded and upright judge to the next occupant who gave\
        \ his name to the close, which it still retains, that of William, or, as he\
        \ was more generally called, Deacon Brodie. This notorious character, who\
        \ was executed at the Old Tolbooth, on the 1st of October 1788, resided in\
        \ the same elegant mansion as had previ ously been the abode of such very\
        \ different persons, \u2014 a suitable enough dwelling for one who stood high\
        \ in repute as a wealthy and substantial citizen, until the daring robbery\
        \ of the Excise-office in Chessels's Court, Canongate, brought to light a\
        \ long-continued system of housebreaking, scarcely ever surpassed in reckless\

        \ latter years, and was visited by Lady Jane Douglas, as appears in the evidence\
        \ of the Douglas Cause. The other tenants of its numerous flats were doubtless\
        \ of corresponding importance in the social scale ; but its most eminent occupant\
        \ was David Hume, who removed thither from Riddle's Land, Lawnmarket, in 1753,\
        \ while engaged in writing his History of England, and continued to reside\
        \ at Jack's Land, during the most important period of his literary career.\
        \ Immediately behind this, in a court on the east side of Big Jack's Close,\
        \ there existed till a few years since some remains of the town mansion of\
        \ General Dalyell, commander of the forces in Scotland during most of the\
        \ reign of Charles II., and the merciless persecutor of the outlawed presbyterians\
        \ during that period. The General's dwelling is described in the Minor Antiquities2\
        \ as \" one of the meanest-looking buildings ever, perhaps, inhabited by a\
        \ gentleman.\" In this, how ever, the author was deceived by the humble appearance\
        \ of the small portion that then remained. There is no reason to believe that\
        \ the stern Muscovite, \u2014 as he was styled from serving under the Russian\
        \ Czar, during the protectorate, \u2014 tempered his cruelties by any such\
        \ Spartan like virtues. The General's residence, on the contrary, appears\
        \ to have done full credit to a courtier of the restoration. We owe the description\
        \ of it, as it existed about the beginning of the present century, to a very\
        \ zealous antiquary3 who was born there in 1787, and resided in the house\
        \ for many years. He has often conversed with another of its tenants who remembered\
        \ being taken to Holyrood when a child to see Prince Charles on his arrival\
        \ at the palace of his forefathers. The chief apartment was a hall of unusually\
        \ large dimensions, with an arched or waggon-shaped ceiling adorned with a\
        \ painting of the sun in the centre, surrounded by gilded rays on an azure\
        \ ground. The remainder of the ceiling was painted to represent sky and clouds,\
        \ and spangled over with a series of silvered stars in relief. The large windows\
        \ were closed below with carved oaken shut ters, similar in style to the fine\
        \ specimen still remaining in Riddle's Close, and the same kind of windows\
        \ existed in other parts of the building. The kitchen also was worthy of notice\
        \ for a fire-place, formed of a plain circular arch, of such unusual di mensions\
        \ that popular credulity might have assigned it for the perpetration of those\

        and had been a captain in the army. What had induced him to leave the world
        and become a monk we did not learn. We next examined the large refectory;
        it was once arranged to dine five or six hundred ; now scarcely one hundred
        assemble, and it must look rather bare and de serted. There is a well-arranged
        hospital for poor tra vellers and pilgrims, where the sick are nursed by the
        monks *. it is, I believe, the first and only attempt which has been made
        in Russia to give an active and self-sacri ficing direction to monastic life.
        The library is said to contain about six thousand vo lumes. The librarian
        was not a monk, nor even in or ders. A curious Hebrew Pentateuch of the twelfth
        cen tury, many ancient Russian theological manuscripts, aud a psalter with
        Russian initials and symbolical miniatures, very prettily painted by various
        Grand Duchesses, were shown us. We also saw two manuscripts relating to the
        Liturgy, in which above every line were written sin gular musical signs, little
        crotchets, strokes, dots, etc., such as I have never seen elsewhere. We were
        told these are often found among the Raskolniks (the old believers), who still
        transcribe and sing by them. There has been found in Germany, in the famous
        abbey of Corvey, a very ancient manuscript* with musical marks which are still
        unexplained. May not these perhaps be the same marks, and might not the key
        be found for their explanation by means of these old Russian notes ?f * It
        is said to be a Litany of the time of Louis the Pious. t The Testament upon
        which the Kings of France took the oath on their coronation at Rheims was
        written with letters which were formerly unknown, and could not be deciphered.

        \ in respect to pubUc charity, prevailed during the last twenty years of the\
        \ eighteenth century than is now exhibited. At that period the direst necessity\
        \ alone could induce any one to apply for pubhc aid, and hence the poor-rates\
        \ levied in the City were of the most trifling kind; the whole sum raised\
        \ in 1790 being only \xA31,460. Perhaps fully as many beggars might be seen\

        \ only received us because it was night, and there was neither water nor inhabited\
        \ spot within ten hours' march. Had it been daytime they would not have considered\
        \ it imperative upon their hospitality to receive us, and we must have pushed\
        \ on. My companions, weary and longing for repose after the fatigues of the\
        \ day, thought to obtain it sooner by carefully concealing the fact of my\
        \ being an European, for fear of exciting their curiosity ; they therefore\
        \ gave out that I was a Parsivan, in the service of Yar Mohamed, thus procuring\

        \ journey from Herat to Kandahar in 1840. He had been received, with all his\
        \ party, by an Afghan chief in the neighbourhood of Washeer, in a most courteous\
        \ and hospi table manner; for he had been honoured with au \"Istigbal\" in\
        \ the Afghan style -^-the eldest son of the Khan, with several horsemen, having\
        \ been sent out to meet him, and to display their feats of horsemanship as\
        \ he approached. The chief had also invited all the principal men of his tribe\
        \ to a feast on the occa sion. early, and a small present in acknow ledgment\
        \ of his kindness. On hearing, however, of his intention to depart sooner\
        \ than had been arranged by fully two hours, the Khan came out to dis suade\
        \ him ; but failing in this, he or dered his horses out to accompany him.\
        \ Dr. Login very civilly declined his escort. After rather a trying march,\
        \ nearly fifty miles, he reached Ghirishk in safety, and was cordially welcomed\
        \ by Captain E , then in charge of the district. On the day after his arrival\
        \ there information was brought in by some of Captain E 's police agents that\
        \ Dr. Login's host of the preceding day had, while he was enjoying his hospitality,\
        \ sent notice to a Dooranee chief named Akhtar Khan, who had for some time\
        \ been in arms against us, and who was encamped with his followers not far\
        \ from Sadaat, that Dr. Login would pass that place at a certain time, urging\
        \ him to intercept him, as he might prove a valuable prize ! Had Dr. Login\
        \ not providentially been induced to start so early, and to decline the proffered\
        \ escort, he might not have got into Girishk so safely; and a valuable copy\
        \ of the - Shah nameh,\" presented by Shah Kamran to her most gracious Majesty,\
        \ of which he was the bearer, and which he has since had the happiness of\
        \ seeing in the Royal Library at Windsor, might have passed through the hands\
        \ of a few more Afghan murderers before reaching those of her Majesty's librarian.\u2014\
        \ L. It was arranged before they parted for the night that the Khan, with\
        \ some of his people, were to accompany Dr. Login next morning for a short\
        \ distance on his way to Girishk. It happened, however, that he awoke very\
        \ early (the Afghan pilau may have been indigest ible!), and could not again\
        \ fall asleep ; and finding that the moon was very bright, and the weather\
        \ most favourable, he left his little tent, which was pitched in the court-yard\
        \ of the caravanserai, and walked outside the gate, where he found a Pharsivan\
        \ awake, holding the horse of a sleeping Afghan, who was supposed to be on\
        \ duty as sentinel. After a little conversation with this man, during which\
        \ he was enlightened as to the character of his host and his people in general,\
        \ and their treatment of Phar sivans in particular, he determined, being anxious\
        \ to get on to Girishk as soon as possible, to wake up his men and proceed\
        \ on his journey. He ac cordingly did so, sending a message to the Khan apologising\
        \ for starting so", 1]

        rich and splendid, chiefly in the French style. The tapestry, how ever, is
        a more interesting work, and it is exceedingly beauti ful. One or two pictures
        which have been copied, or are now in progress, have quite the effect of paintings
        at a little distance. The best of those which we saw is a picture of Alexander
        the Great, receiving the family of Darius. Another splendid work of art which
        we have lately seen is a miniature temple destined to be placed in the church
        of St. Isaac, and in the mean time standing for safety in the large hall of
        the Tauride, which serves at present as a receptacle for the furniture saved
        from the Winter Palace. This shrine or temple consists of a dome seven feet
        in diameter, supported on eight Corinthian pillars about eight feet high.
        The exterior of the dome is covered with a profusion of gilding on a ground
        ot malachite, and the interior is of lapis lazuli. The pillars are of malachite,
        with gilt bases and capitals, and the floor is of polished stone of various
        colours ; the whole being raised on steps of polished porphyry. There is,
        perhaps, too much gild ing about this very beautiful work, but this is much
        in accord ance with its destined position in a Greek church. It was presented
        to the Emperor by M. Demideff, who procured the malachite from his mines in
        Siberia, and who sent it to Italy to be worked. Malachite is, as you probably
        are aware, a stone peculiar to the copper-mines of Siberia. It is of the colour
        of verdigris marbled, and bears evident marks of having once been in a state
        of fusion. It can only be obtained in small pieces, so that all malachite
        work, however solid it may appear, is a species of mosaic formed of innumerable
        fragments of irregular shape. In the visit of which I have spoken to the Public
        Library, I was chiefly interested by the collection of MSS. ; some of the
        most remarkable of which were pointed out to me by Mr. Atkinson, the librarian,
        who was kind enough to accompany me over the whole Institution. The library
        contains about four hundred thousand volumes, a considerable part of which
        were acquired by right of might, having been transferred to Petersburg from
        the Public Library at Warsaw. There are about forty thousand volumes of MSS.',

        \ only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against it, with all the illiberal petu\
        \ lance, arrogance, and scurrility, which distinguish the Warburtonian school.\
        \ This pamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise indifferent reception\
        \ of my performance. In 1756, two years after the fall of Ihe first volume,\
        \ was published the second volume of my History, containing the period from\
        \ the death of Charles I. till the Revolution. This performance happened to\
        \ give less displeasure to the WThjg\xAB, and was better received. It not\
        \ only rose itself, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother. But though\
        \ I had been taught by experience, that the Whig party were in possession\
        \ of be stowing all places, both in the state and in litera ture, 1 was so\
        \ little inclined to yield to their senseless clamor, that in above a hundred\
        \ altera tions, which farther stud}', reading, or recollection engaged me\
        \ to make in the reigns of the two first Stuarts, I have made all of them\
        \ invariably to the Tory side. It is ridiculous to consider the English constitution\
        \ before that period a.s a regular plan of liberty. In 1759 I published my\
        \ History of the House of Tudor. The clamor against this performance was almost\
        \ equal to that against the History of the two first Stuarts. The reign of\
        \ Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I was now callous against the\
        \ impressions of public folly, and con tinued, very peaceably and contentedly,\
        \ in my retreat at Edinburgh, to finish, in two volumes, the more early part\
        \ of the English History, which I gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable,\
        \ and but tolerable, success. But notwithstanding this variety of winds and\
        \ seasons to which my writings had been exposed, they had still been making\
        \ such advances, th3i the copy-money given me by the booksellers much exceeded\
        \ any thing formerly known in England; I was become not only independent,\
        \ but o-pulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, deter mined never\
        \ more to set my foot cut of it; and retaining the satisfaction of never having\
        \ pre ferred a request to one great man, or even making advances of friendship\
        \ to any of them. A& I was now turned of fifty, I thought of passing all the\
        \ rest of my life in this philosophical manner, when I received, in 1763,\
        \ an invitation from the earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the least\
        \ ac quainted, to attend him on his embassy to Paris, with a near prospect\
        \ of being appointed secretary to the embassy; and, in the meanwhile, of per\
        \ forming the functions of that office. This offer, however inviting, I at\
        \ first declines!, both because I was reluctant to begin connexions with the\
        \ great, and because I was afraid that the civilities and gay company of Paris\
        \ would prove disagree able to a person of my age and humor: but on his repeating\
        \ the invitation, I accepted of it. I have every reason, both of pleasure\
        \ and interest, to think myself happy in my connexions with that nobleman,\
        \ os well as afterwards with hi* brother, general Conway. Those who have not\
        \ seen the strange effects of modes, will never imagine the reception I met\
        \ with at Paris, from men and women of all ranks and stations. The more I\
        \ resiled from their excessive civilities, the more I was loaded with them.\
        \ There is, however, a real satisfaction in living at Paris, from the great\
        \ number of sensible, knowing, and polite company with which that city abounds\
        \ above all places in the universe. I thought once of settling there for life.\
        \ I was appointed secretary to the embassy; and, in summer 1765, Lord Hertford\
        \ left me, being of my treatise that 1 cast anew. Meanwhile my bookseller,\
        \ A. Millar, informed me that my former publications (all but the unfortunate\
        \ Treatise) were beginning to be the subject of conversation ; that the sale\
        \ of them was gradually increasing, aud that new editions were demanded. Answers\
        \ by Reverends and Right Reverends came out two or three in a year; and I\
        \ found by Dr. Warburton's railing, that the books were beginning to be esteemed\
        \ in good company. However, I had a fixed resolution, which I \"inflexibly\
        \ maintained, \"never to reply to any body; and not being very irascible in\
        \ my temper, I have easily kept myself clear of all literary squabbles. These\
        \ symptoms of arising reputation gave me encouragement, as t was ever more\
        \ disposed to see the favorable than unfavorable side of things; a turn of\
        \ mind which it is more happy to possess, than to be born to an estate of\
        \ ten thousand a year. In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the\
        \ true scene for a man of letters. In 1752 were published at Edinburgh, where\
        \ I then lived, my Political Discourses, the only work of mine that was successful\
        \ on the first publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the\
        \ same year was published at London, my Inquiry concerning the Principles\
        \ of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject),\
        \ is of all my writings, historical, philoso phical, or literary, incomparably\
        \ the best- It came unnoticed and unobserved into the world. In 1752 the Faculty\
        \ of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little\
        \ or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library. I then\
        \ formed the plan of writing the History of England; but being frightened\
        \ with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of seventeen\
        \ hundred years, I commenced with the accession of the house of Stuartr an\
        \ epoch when I thought the misrepresentations of faction began chiefly to\
        \ take place. I was, I own, sanguine in my ex pectations of the success of\
        \ this work. I thought that I was the only historian that had at once neglected\
        \ present power, interest, and authority, and the cry of popular piejudices;\
        \ and as the subject was suited to every capacity, I expected proportional\
        \ applause. But miserable was my disappointment: I was assailed by one cry\
        \ of reproach, disapprobation, and even detestation; English, Scotch, and\
        \ Irish, Whig and Tory, church man and sectary, freethinker and religionist,\
        \ pa triot and courtier, united in their rage against the man who had presumed\
        \ to shed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and the earl of Strafford\
        \ ; and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over, what was still\
        \ more mortifying, the book \u25A0seemed to sink into oblivion. Mr. Millar\
        \ told me, that in a twelvemonth he sold only forty-five copies of it. I scarcely,\
        \ indeed, heard of one man in the three kingdoms, considerable for rank or\
        \ letters, that could endure the book. I must only except the primate of England,\
        \ Dr. Herring, and the primate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions.\
        \ These dignified prelates sepa rately sent me messages not to be discouraged.\
        \ I was, however, I confess, discouraged; and had not the war at that time\
        \ been breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired to\
        \ some provincial town of the former kingdom, have chrtnged my name, and never\
        \ more have returned to my native country. But as this scheme was not now\
        \ practicable, and the subse quent volume was considerably advanced, I re-\
        \ Solved to pick up courage and to persevere. In this interval, I published\

        multifarious duties of president, professor, tutor, and librarian.1 Such were
        the caresses received by the posthumous offspring of John Harvard.2 Nor was
        its early promise spoiled by indulgence. It increased each year in public
        estimation. The theses of its first graduating class embraced a wide scope
        of academical learning,3 and exhibited the results of a training, which, if
        less showy, was more scholastic than can be obtained at present. And it is
        sufficient for the glory of the venerable university to say, that its existence
        was recognized in the republic of letters long before the more ambitious structure
        of its founders was known in the family of nations. Rising in homely grandeur
        in the midst of the wilder ness, the solitary Hall of Harvard soon became
        an object of more affectionate interest than the towers of Oxford and Cambridge.
        For its welfare, the elders prayed and the magistrates legislated. It was
        to train not only scholars but Puritans ; 4 and the future preachers of the
        colony were to go out from its shades, as well as the lawgivers and magistrates.
        But in such aspirations as these, the humble hopes of its early benefactors
        were forgotten. In becoming a Puritan college, it ceased to be a school for
        humanity. One lonely Indian youth wrung from its condescending liberality

        overseers long before it had pro fessors. 2 The college was chiefly indebted
        to Rev. John Harvard, of Emman uel College, Cambridge. Savage, in an interesting
        note, gives an ex tract from an old almanac, by which it appears that he gave
        seven hun dred pounds, or half of his estate. He left, says this diligent

        one man, to inquire into his condition. The most eminent surgeon in Italy
        was summoned to his aid from Padua, the expenses of his illness were borne
        by the state, and, on his recovery, his salary was doubled. Upon his death,
        many years later, the republic directed its ambassadors to communicate officially
        the fact to all the crowned heads in Europe, as a public calamity. A highly
        honorable name in the literature of Venice is that of the Abbe Morelli, a
        man of great learning and immense industry, for many years librarian of St.
        Mark''s, and the writer and editor of books enough to form of themselves a
        moderate library. There is still a considerable amount of intellectual activity
        at Venice. Adrien Balbi, the great geographer, who died in 1848, was a native
        of Venice. Madame Albrizzi, well-known by a sketch of the works of Canova,
        though a native of Corfu, passed the greater part of her life at Venice, and
        was a Vene tian in everything but birth. M. Lecomte, in his interesting work
        on Venice, from which I have already more than once quoted, records a list
        of the living men of science and letters in Venice, with a brief account of
        their labors, which gives honorable proof of scientific and literary industry,
        under cir cumstances little calculated to encourage it. THE ARCHDUCHESS MARIA
        LOUISA. My last day in Venice was marked by the arrival of the Archduchess
        Maria Louisa, of Parma, at the hotel where I lodged.* She came in tlie steamer
        from Trieste, which, in honor of her, instead of stopping at the entrance
        ofthe Grand Canal, proceeded a considerable distance upon it, and landed her
        distinguished passenger from a point opposite the hotel. The dignitaries of
        Venice, civil and military, were assembled there to receive her ; among them,
        an old officer, very short and very fat, dressed in a rich, scarlet, hussar
        uniform, which * My lodgings were in the Palazzo Grass! , degraded into a
        hotel called the Emperor of Austria. It is on the Grand Canal near the first
        turn. It is an imposing building, with a front of rustic, Doric, and Corinthian
        architecture. The court, or vestibule, is of noble proportions, supported
        by granite pillars, among which were three or four large orange-trees in tubs,
        making a fine picture as one entered. The spacious rooms were cut up by shabby
        partitions, in a way to make the bones of the founder stir in his grave. M.
        Lecomte says that this palace was sold a few years since for a hundred thousand
        francs, and that it must have cost six times that sum.', 1]

        \ not dealt quite fairly with Italian landscape gardening, nor judged of it\
        \ with reference to the ends proposed to be ac complished by it. Their groves\
        \ nodding at groves, their fra ternal alleys, their formal walls of verdure,\
        \ are not caricatures of Nature, introduced from a perverse preference of\
        \ what is quaint and fantastic, but simply such a direction and use of the\
        \ energies of Nature as shall produce certain results which are required by\
        \ the climate, and which shall so blend with the features of the palace or\
        \ villa, as to produce an architectural whole. The Villa Albani has an interest\
        \ in the history of art from its association with the name of Winckelmann,\
        \ who resided there more or less for several years, in the capacity of librarian\
        \ to Cardinal Albani. The relation between them was honorable to both parties,\
        \ and is an instance of patronage, extended and received, without unreasonable\
        \ exactions on the one side, or degrading subserviency on the other. The liberality\
        \ of the cardinal was directed by the taste and knowledge of Winckel- mann,\
        \ whilst, with the command of the cardinal's resources and the sense of security\
        \ and mental self-possession given by his delicate generosity, the researches\
        \ of Winckelmann were pros- ecuted under the most favorable conditions, and\
        \ led to most successful results. It is a happy combination, when the streams\
        \ of wealth are thus guided by the hands of genius and taste ; they are sure\
        \ to bring beauty and fertility in their train. I visited this villa on the\
        \ twenty-second day of February, with a numerous party prepared to enjoy and\
        \ not to criticize. The day was of rare beauty, and the air full of that dreamy\
        \ softness so characteristic of an Italian spring. The distant hills stood\
        \ up in the clear air, with their waving outlines dis tinctly cut against\
        \ the warm, blue sky. The sunshine turned the spray of ihe fountains into\
        \ a substance dazzling as itself. Many flowers were already in bloom, and\
        \ the day was warm enough to make the shadows attractive to the eye, and the\
        \ sound of flowing and falling water musical to the ear. All of", 1]

        \ of West, Moser, and Cotes, and submitted to the king, who entering with\
        \ great zeal into the project, directed that the new institution should be\
        \ called the Royal Academy, and placed under his immediate protection and\
        \ patronage. By the \" Instru- ment of Institution\" the society was to consist\
        \ of \"40 academicians chosen from among the most able and respectable artists\
        \ resident in Great Britain ;\" 20 associates from whom future academicians\
        \ were to be selected ; and six associate engravers. There is to be an annual\
        \ exhibition of works of art, which is to be open to all artists to contribute\
        \ works, subject to the approval of a committee of selection. Schools of painting\
        \ and of drawing from the life and from casts are provided, which are to be\
        \ open without charge to all students who have acquired proper rudimentary\
        \ instruction, and who conform to the rules of the institution : and professors\
        \ are annually to read courses of lectures on the principles of the arts of\
        \ painting, sculpture, and architecture, and also on anatomy and perspective.\
        \ Hogarth was dead.; but had he been living he would not have joined the infant\
        \ academy, \" considering,\" as he wrote to lord Bute, \"the electing presidents,\
        \ professors, &c, as a ridiculous imitation of the foolish parade of the French\
        \ Academy.\" Reynolds held aloof from all the preliminary proceedings, and\
        \ it was not until he was apprised that it was the wish of the king that he\
        \ should be its first president, and that it was his majesty's intention on\
        \ his installation into that office to confer upon him the honour of knighthood,\
        \ that he consented to join the new society. The foun- * Edwards\u2014 Introduction,\

        \ alive, although utterly insensible to what opinions might be held of the\
        \ honesty of his arch-enemy. Probably the study of Junius as a master of invective\
        \ was seriously damaging to our capacity for forming a correct judgment of\
        \ the public men of a very re markable period. Certainly it required a much\
        \ more intimate acquaintance With the real materials for an impartial view\
        \ of national affairs than were then open to us, to divest ourselves of a\
        \ lingering confidence that these brilliant epigrams of an anonymous assailant\
        \ of the great had not only a broad foundation of truth to rest upon, but\
        \ were substantially true. Unques tionably it demanded a strong exercise of\
        \ the reasoning faculty not to be seduced by the fascination of the mystery\
        \ which had so long defied an absolute solution. It was more than difficult\
        \ not to believe that this man in the mask was some grand and awful magician,\
        \ endued with all-penetrating knowledge, wondrous ability, and irresistible\
        \ power. The tardy conviction at length arrived that, whether of high rank\
        \ or of humble, a senator or a garreteer, a minister of state or an eavesdropper,\
        \ a noble lord in a blue ribbon or an office clerk, he was, taken all in all,\
        \ one of the most abandoned of anonymous literary assassins ; that no writer\
        \ ever more abused the power of the press for the gratification of his \"\
        \ envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness.\" Again we read Junius,\
        \ now that we have to write of Grafton, Mansfield, Bedford, whom he made his\
        \ quarry. When we now see that his elaborately pointed periods are rarely\
        \ the vehicle of anything higher than temporary personalities of the dirtiest\
        \ character such as a gentleman would scorn, and of dastardly insinuations\
        \ such as none but a coward could utter in disguise, we care not to trouble\
        \ ourselves about the solution of the riddle which has engaged so many acute\
        \ minds \u2014 Who was Junius ? We are content with asking, What was Junius\
        \ ? If that question be answered in accordance with our opinion of his character,\
        \ we may arrive at one safe conclusion1 \u2014 Who Junius was not. Horace\
        \ Walpole has a remark upon the author of Junius, which appears to have been\
        \ overlooked by some who think that the literary merit of these Letters will\
        \ keep their moral turpitude in the back-ground. \"Men,\" he says, \" wondered\

        \ historian got hold of this \"MS. \" and published a work on America, making\
        \ extract after extract from it, and citing it as a \"MS . History of the\
        \ Plantation of Plymouth, &c, in the Fulham Library;\" sent several copies\
        \ to learned savans of Boston; and yet notwithstanding that it was a historical\
        \ work that no writer on American history ought to have been unacquainted\
        \ with, our historians went on editing and publishing histories by the score,\
        \ taking no more notice of this \"MS. History or the Plantation of Plymouth,\"\
        \ than if such \"MS.\" were as plenty as blackberries. And yet Mr. Deane,\
        \ the editor of the \"MS.\" says that any one familiar with Bradford's History\
        \ would at once recognize those extracts as the language of Brad- ford as\
        \ cited by Morton and Prince. That history is the one published by the Bishop\
        \ of Oxford in 1846 (second edition), enti- tled \"A History of the Protestant\
        \ Episcopal Church of America,\" and which finally led to the discovery of\
        \ the manuscript. A year or more ago, when the Rev. Mr. Barry, the reputed\
        \ dis- coverer of this manuscript, was carrying his first volume of the history\
        \ of Massachusetts through the press, and eager for new* matter for his book,\
        \ Mr. Thornton (J. W.), author of the landing at Cape Ann, who has given great\
        \ attention to our early history, was at Burnham's indulging his antiquarian\
        \ tastes, rummaging among the fossil remains of literature there congregated,\
        \ when he chanced to take up the Bishop's bools, and in turning over its pages,\
        \ he met with several pas- sages purporting to be extracts, that seemed to\
        \ sound familiar, which he found credited to \"MS. History of the Plantation\
        \ of Plymouth, 0. C, in- the Fulham Library.\" New facts, also, were stated\
        \ on the authority of the same MS. He forthwith bought the book and took it\
        \ home, de- termined to know more about that MS. Desir ous to serve his friend,\
        \ the Rev. Mr. Barry, whose history was then in press, and whose proof sheets,\
        \ including the period embraced by the MS., were then before him, he underscored\
        \ some of the extracts, and doubly underscored those citations of the MS.,\
        \ and passed the book at once to Mr. B., that he might not lose the bene fit\
        \ of the new matter in his first edition, where it accordingly appears in\
        \ the proper place. Mr. Barry being then fresh from Morton and Prince, and\
        \ through them familiar with Bradford, was not long in concluding that this\
        \ was the long-tost \"MS.'' Instead, however, of conferring with Mr. T. about\
        \ it, he forthwith sped in another direction, and the next day or day after\
        \ when Mr. T. regained his book to pursue his inquiries, he found that his\
        \ learned and certainly industri- ous friend had an order already on the way\
        \ to London for a copy of the \"MS.,' and all the equi- ties of discovery\
        \ and acquisition duly chanceryed, and settled between himself and other high\
        \ con- tracting parties. Under such circumstances, it seems to me that Mr.\
        \ Barry is about as much en- titled to credit for the discovery of the MS.,\
        \ as if some one had brought it all the way from' Lon- don and shook it in\
        \ his face, yft,/* yi, Carl. Bradford's History and Libraries. There has been\
        \ a good deal of congratulation of late, occasioned by the discovery of the\
        \ long lost Governor Bradford Manuscript. \"While the lit- erary world are\
        \ rejoicing, mere mortal men, who do not belong to historical societies, are\
        \ no an- tiquaries, and never wrote a history in their lives, are wondering\
        \ how it could happen that by far the most valuable manuscript connected witli\
        \ our Puriten and New England history, could lie undiscovered in a public\
        \ library so long, say more than three quarters of a century.. In all that\
        \ time antiquaries were supposed to be mousing for it, teamed historical bodies\
        \ delving after it, and profound historians ready to scent it afar off. The\
        \ fact that Prince, Morton, and Hutchinson had used it freely in their histories,\
        \ gave our historians familiar acquain- tance with it, &c, so that its loss,\
        \ its value, its style and character, were well known, and furnished a ready\
        \ and sure means of identifying it. Our wonder, however, is modified, when\
        \ we remember the peculiar mode of administering li- braries in this country,\
        \ as welt as in England. Tlic Bi.*hop of London's library, where this man-\

        \ the year past had taken only thirty books from the library. On inquiry it\
        \ was found that one of the professors was librarian; that by the rules he\
        \ was only required to have it open an hour on certain - days, and that he\
        \ had hit upon the wise expedi- ent of makiDg that opening at the students'\
        \ din- ner hour, thus preventing a great deal of noise and confusion, and\
        \ rendering the duties of his office quite quiet and comfortable. Suppose\

        \ would it not have stood a very fair chance of remaining incog, for a century\

        \ number, I apprehend, could be counted dn your fingers very siandily. On\

        \ to visit the largest library in our coun- try, to see and admire, if not\
        \ to investigate and verify, I have always found it as impregnable as Sebastopol.\

        \ \"Carl,\" in the Evening Transcript of the 17th inst., has done justice\
        \ to J. Wingate Thornton, Esq., and \u2014gently \u2014 to the Rev. John Stetson\
        \ Bany, he is in error in regard to the custodians of our public libraries'.\
        \ Permit me to verify this statement by citing my own experience. In preparing\
        \ \"The Youth of the Old Domi nion,\" or, The Early History of Virginia, just\
        \ published by Jewett & Co., I wished to consult all the old and rare authorities.\
        \ For this pur pose, and with no other advantage than an ordi nary letter\
        \ of introduction, I applied at the li brary of Harvard. It was instantly\
        \ at my ser vice. It was regularly open to any visitant six or seven hours\
        \ everyday; and, so far from find ing it a \"literary sepulchre\" and \"its\
        \ alcoves ta boed,\" I found that the Rev. Mr. Sibley was to the library itself\
        \ what the key was to the door; better even, for he voluntarily sought out\
        \ volumes which I needed, and of which I was ignorant ; spread them before\
        \ me with as much alacrity, enthusiasm, and apparent satisfaction as though\
        \ serving only himself; and even gave me entrant* and his personal services\
        \ in other than the library hours. But more. I was permitted to take thence\
        \ to my own study\u2014 more than an hundred miles \u2014 whatever volumes\
        \ I wanted, and even to retain them for several months. The same un bounded\
        \ attentions I have since received from him in investigating the early history\
        \ of Massa chusetts. What greater courtesy could anyone ask? Yet I was at\
        \ first an utter stranger, and had not the shadow of a claim for the least\
        \ attention. Under like circumstances, I have been favored with loans from\
        \ the Boston Athen\xE6um ; and also, by the Librarian of Yale College, to\
        \ whom, per sonally, I am even unknown. To the Librarian of the Antiquarian\
        \ Society at Worcester, I introduced myself. Yet on so slight a ground, he\
        \ just now writes, saying \u2014 \"I shall be happy to afford you an opportunity\
        \ to consult the works which are in the Library in such a manner as may best\
        \ suit your convenience. I should regret exceedingly to have you fail to obtai\xBB\
        \ whatever our Library is able to supply for want of efficient assistance.\"\
        \ Such, sir, has been my tot in these instances, and at other libraries in\
        \ the city of Boston to which, as a perfect stranger, I have applied; and,\
        \ as I have no claims upon attention other than are common to the most humble\
        \ individu als, I think myself authorized to say that the like cheerful politeness\
        \ would be extended at any New England Library, to any gentleman wishing to\
        \ avail himself of its hoards of literary wealth. I think, sir, you will be\
        \ as ready to use your columns in correcting the misapprehensions of your\
        \ correspondent, as in doing justice to Mr. Thornton. Respectfully Yours,\

        \ the Transcript: In your paper of the 17th lilt. 1 find a communication signed\
        \ \"Carl,\" in which an account of the discovery of Bradford's lost History\
        \ of Plymouth Plantation is given. I agree with the -writer that the merit\
        \ of discover ing this manuscript clearly belongs to J. Winga e Thornton,\
        \ Esq., author of the \"Landing at Cape Anne.\" In one particular, however,\
        \ I think your correspondent is misinformed. He says : \"Mr. Barry being then\
        \ fresh from Morton and Prince, and through them familiar with Bradford, was\
        \ not long in concluding that this was the long lost MS.\" This is giving\
        \ Mr. Barry credit for a inore per fect knowledge of Bradford at that time\
        \ than I think he would claim for himself. I have several times conversed\
        \ with a gentleman who was pres ent when Mr. Barry showed the quotations in\
        \ the Bishop of Oxford's book to Mr. Drake, (the first person, I believe,\
        \ whom he consulted con cein'ng it,) and asked his opinion respecting the\
        \ manuscript there quoted. Mr. Drake at once stated that certain portions\
        \ of the quotations were identical with passages in Bradford preserv ed by\
        \ our early New England historians, suggest ed that the volume might be the\
        \ lost history of Bradford itself, or a copy of the same, and urged him to\
        \ pursue the inquiry. But even after Mr. Drake had made this suggestion, Mr.\
        \ Barry did'' not appear willing to commit himself so far as to say that he\
        \ ' thought Mr. Drake's conjecture a plausible one. AU he would' say was that\
        \ there was something new there. As the volume so fortunately recovered is\
        \ in the highest degree valuable to students of New England history, and ss\
        \ the discovery of it was very unexpected, much curiosity naturally ex ists\
        \ as to the manner in which the discovery hap pened to be made. I may therefore\
        \ be excused for adding my mite to the meagre information on this subject\
        \ already laid blfore the public. I believe that no claim, inconsistent with\
        \ what I have just stated, has been made by Mr. Barry, whatever his friends\
        \ may have done. % cu*f. ?% X \xABT ioia.", 2]

  - - ["PREFACE. and about the middle of the mouth of June last, I had succeeded in\
        \ disposing of a book, then scarcely begun, to Mr. Peter Sinclair, Bookseller,\
        \ John Street, in the City of Quebec. That gentleman, with characteristic\
        \ spirit and liberality, agreed to become my publisher, and until the 17th\
        \ day of September, I read and wrote diligently, having written, in round\
        \ numbers, about a thousand pages ot foolscap and brought to a conclusion\
        \ the first rebellion. Then the work of print- ing was begun, and the correction\
        \ of all the proofs together with the editorial management of a newspaper,\
        \ have since afforded me sufficient occupation. Mr. McMullen, of Brockville,\
        \ has, however, produced a history of this country from its discovery to the\
        \ present time, almost as if he had been influenced by motives similar to\
        \ those which have influenced ma. His pictures, however, are not my pictures,\
        \ nor his sentiments my sentiments. The books \u2014 although the facts are\
        \ the same and necessarily derived from the same sources \u2014 are essentially\
        \ different. He is most elaborate in the beginning, I become more and more\
        \ particular with regard to details towards the close \u2014 I expand with\
        \ the expansion of the country. In the first chapter of this first volume,\
        \ the history of the province while under French rule is rapidly traced, and\
        \ the history of the New England Colonies dipped into, with the view of showing\
        \ the progressional resemblance betweeu that country which is now the United\
        \ States and our own ; in the second chapter the reader obtains only a glance,\
        \ as it were, at the American war of indepen- dence, when he is carried again\
        \ into Canada and made acquainted with the many difficulties in spite of which\
        \ Upper and Lower Canada continued to advance in wealth and civilisation ;\
        \ in the third chapter a history of the war between England and the United\
        \ States is given with considerable minuteness ; and the fourth chapter brings\
        \ the reader up to the termination of that extraordinary period of mis-government,\
        \ subsequent to the American war, which continued until the Rebellion, and\
        \ has not even yet been altogether got rid of. There are without doubt, errors,\
        \ exceptions, and omissions enough to be found \u2014 an island may have been\
        \ inadvertently placed in a wrong lake, a date or figure may be incorrect,\
        \ words may have been misprinted, and, in some parts, the sense a little interfered\
        \ with \u2014 but I have set down nothing in malice, having had a strict regard\
        \ for truth. I have creamed Gourlay, Christie, Murray, Alison, Wells, and\
        \ Henry, and taken whatever I djem id essential from a history of the United\
        \ States, without a title page, and from Jared Sparks and other authors ;\
        \ but for the history of Low.:r Canada my chief reliance has been upon the\
        \ valuable volumes, compiled with so much care, by Mr. Christie, and I have\
        \ put the essence of his sixth volume of revelations in its fitting place.\
        \ For va uable assistance in the way of information, 1 am indebted to Mr.\
        \ Christie personally, to the Honble. Henry Black, to the Librarians of the\

        \ Institute, upon shelves provided by the Council of that Body ; the whole\
        \ of the shelves are nearly filled, and more will be shortly required. The\
        \ number of searches made between January and July, 1858, was 110 ; during\
        \ the same period in 1859, 170, being an increase of 64. The duties of the\
        \ Librarian are to receive the Specifications as they are sent from the Patent\
        \ Office, to arrange them for the Binder, to dis tribute those granted under\
        \ the old Law (which at present are not bound) in their respective packages,\
        \ to attend upon all persons desirous of making searches, and to supply them\
        \ with the Specifications they require, to assist them in their searches,\
        \ and to restore the volumes to their proper places. The searches occupy from\
        \ one to several hours, and as it is necessary for the preservation of the\
        \ Specifications that no search should be made in the absence of the Librarian,\
        \ his constant attendance during the hours the Library is open (from 10 to\
        \ 5 daily) is absolutely required. Your Com mittee have ascertained, from\
        \ an interview they have had with Mr. Arthur Ryland and Mr. Robert Wright\
        \ on behalf of the Institute, that the duties of the Secretary, who has hitherto\
        \ acted as Librarian, no longer permit him to perform that office, and that\
        \ the appointment of a person as Librarian has become a matter of necessity,\
        \ but inasmuch as the whole of his time would not be occupied in the discharge\
        \ of those duties, and he might render considerable service to the Institute,\
        \ it was suggested that the Corporation should be asked to contribute a sum\
        \ of 10s. per week towards the salary of such officer, it being estimated\
        \ that the services of a competent person might be obtained for about \xA3\
        1 per week, and your Committee recommend that the Council authorise them to\
        \ make such contribution. The cost of fitting up another compartment in the\
        \ Library with shelves it is estimated will be about \xA32. 10s., and your\
        \ Committee recom mend that such compartment be fitted up at the cost of the\
        \ Corporation. The Specifications unbound commence with the year 1614, and\
        \ con tinue down to 1852 ; the expense of binding them will be about \xA3\
        100. Your Committee recommend that authority be given them to have these Works\
        \ bound uniformly with those already completed.", 4]
    - ["341 Your Committee further suggest that in order to meet the expenditure that\
        \ will be entailed upon the Council by the adoption of the foregoing recommendations,\
        \ they be authorised to open a correspondence with the Commissioners of Patents\
        \ in London, with a view of obtaining permission to make the customary small\
        \ charge for each search among the Specifica tions of Patents placed in the\
        \ possession of the Corporation. Your Committee also recommend that they be\
        \ authorised to call the attention of the Home Secretary to the fact that\
        \ a considerable number of Cells in the Borough Gaol are now empty, and that\
        \ the Council is informed by the Borough Justices that fifty of such cells\
        \ may be advantageously let for the reception of prisoners from other Gaols\
        \ which may happen to be overcrowded, and to take all such steps as they may\
        \ deem advisable to carry such an arrangement into effect. Resolved \u2014\
        \ 2757. That the General Purposes Committee be authorised and instructed to\
        \ certify under the hand of their Chairman to the Finance Committee for payment\
        \ of a sum not exceeding Ten Shillings per week, as a contribution to the\
        \ salary of a Librarian of the Patent Specification Library ; also to provide\
        \ additional shelves for the reception of the Speci fications in such Library,\
        \ and to have the unbound Specifications bound uniformly with those already\
        \ completed. Resolved \u2014 2758. That the General Purposes Committee be\
        \ authorised to carry into effect the recommendation contained in their Report\
        \ as to the letting of fifty of the vacant Cells in the Borough Gaol for the\
        \ reception of prisoners from other prisons. Resolved \u2014 2759. That the\
        \ Report of the General Purposes Committee be approved, with the exception\

        \ two or three sides of the apartment rises a low divan on which the students\
        \ sit to read, whilst a narrow form in front serves as a table or support\

        works about 1750. They are placed in an ornamented chamber, of which two sides

    - ['Letter X. PUBLIC LIRRARIES. 215 The Libraries are open to the public every
        day in the week, except Tuesday and Friday. The librarians, under whose care
        and guardianship they are placed, are called Kutub, and are to be found at
        their post through out the whole day. They receive visitors with the grave
        urbanity and dignified kindness of demeanour peculiar to the East. Visitors
        are permitted to make extracts, and even entire copies, of any of the works
        the Library contains ; but the removal of any volume is most strictly forbidden.
        Until within a recent period the same prejudice which prohibited Christians
        in general, but especially Franks, from purchas ing Musulman books in the
        bazaars, also closed against them the entrance of the libraries, except under
        a special Ferman, but this prohibition, against which numerous complaints
        have been raised, has doubtless by this time been removed.2 2 The establishment
        of Public Libraries at Constantinople dates from the earliest years of the
        conquest. The first Ottoman Sultans sought, like their predecessors the Caliphs,
        to illustrate their reigns by encou raging learned men, and founding establishments
        wherein their labours, and those of their forerunners in the fields of science
        and literature, might be preserved to posterity. The greater part of the treasures
        of Arabic literature, collected by the Abasside Caliphs, perished in the various
        fires which at diflerent periods ravaged Bagdad, but principally in the great
        conflagration of 1060, which destroyed the famous library of the Vizier Erd-fheer,
        containing nearly 10,0o0 volumes ; and in 1258, when Bagdad was sacked and
        nearly destroyed by the grandson of Jenghis Khan. Nevertheless Mohammed II,
        was able to collect a sufficient number of books from Brousa, Damascus, and
        various other cities, to form the libraries of Eyoub, Santa Sophia, and of
        the Mosque erected by himself. The example of Mohammed was followed by the
        three Sultans who succeeded him, and subsequently by some of their successors.

        \ one circumstance, it must be confessed, which at first sight seems to militate\
        \ against his having died on the Crusade. Among the ' Pedes Finium ' there\
        \ is one, dated 26 April, 1271, where in the name of Sir Rogee de Leybuen\

        \ with Bartholomew de Wadeton, for that of Gare) without the addition of the\
        \ words \" per attornaturo suum,\" as though he were himself present in court.\
        \ But I do not attach very great importance to this fact, as evidence against\
        \ the etrong arguments on the other side. These Fines were passed frequently\
        \ without the actual presence of the parties, and unless it is stated that\
        \ they were actually there in court, we may be content to believe them absent\
        \ even though the words \" per attor natum suum\" be not subjoined. Beside\
        \ which, these Fines were only the enrolment of imaginary suits, in order\
        \ to place on record the conveyance of property, etc., which had often taken\
        \ place some time before the actual passing of the Fine. Still the circumstance\
        \ should be honestly noted in our endeavours to arrive at the truth. On the\
        \ Charter Roll, also, there is an Inspeximus of a Grant by Roger de Rolling\

        \ to Rogee de Leyboene and Alianoee his wife (v. Rot. Cart. 55 Hen. III. m.\

        \ for most valuable assistance in collecting materials for these Notes, I\
        \ am enabled to quote, as authority for the statement in the text, a copy\

        here until this time. In my intercourse with the prisoners, I was guided sys
        tematically by the same rules with which I visited Union soldiers. The prisoners
        were equally well lodged with our own men. I remarked at the time of their
        arrival how neat and comfortable a provision had been made in the tents and
        pavilions for their comfort, with an ample supply of beds and bedding. I met
        the first transport at Philadelphia, and returned on the same with them to
        David''s Island. The prisoners w< re in a most filthy condition, miserably
        clad, and covered /An vermin. Each man received a bath and was immed''" ''aly
        furnished with clean clothing, the old clothing beLv; re moved and burned.
        In the prosecution of my duties I was frequently present at their dinners,
        which were ample, superior, both as respects quantity and quality, to anything
        I have ever seen in hospital diet. The diet furnished to them was superior
        even to that of our own patients. This resulted from the fact that many little
        luxuries were fur nished by private donation. There were other comforts and
        conveniences afforded them beyond those of food, clothing, and shelter. A
        library of two thousand volumes, that had been pre viously used by our own
        soldiers, was at once thrown open to them, and every facility afforded for
        the use of the volumes. Being present as librarian, and taking each man''s
        name as he received his book, the library was used by them far more than by
        our own people. As had been my practice, I went through the tents and pavilions
        with bibles and prayer books, making the special inquiry to every man, " Are
        you supplied ?" And furnishing books in all cases where they were required.

        \ investigators of this subject, however, have found it previously necessary\
        \ to agree upon an answer to the question, ' What is a newspaper?' Many small\
        \ sheets were issued in old days, each containing an account of some one event,\
        \ but having neither a preceding nor a foUowing number under the same title.\
        \ If it be agreed that the word 'newspaper' shaU be applied only to a publication\
        \ which has the following characteristics \u2014 a treatment of news from\
        \ various parts of the world, a common title for every issue, a series of\
        \ numbers applied to them aU, a date to each number, and a regular period\
        \ between the issues \u2014 then multitudes of old publications which have\
        \ hitherto been caUed newspapers must be expelled from the list. It matters\
        \ not what we caU them, provided there be a general agreement as to the scope\
        \ of the word used. A very unkind blow was administered to our national vanity\
        \ somewhat more than twenty years ago. We fancied we possessed in our great\
        \ National Library at the British Museum, a real printed English newspaper,\
        \ two centuries and a dials old. Among the Sloane MSS. is a volume containing\
        \ what purport to be three numbers of the English Mercurie, a newspaper published\
        \ in 1588 : they profess to be Nos. 50, 51, aud 54 of a series : and they\
        \ give numerous particulars of the Spanish Armada, a subject of absorbing\
        \ interest in those days. Each number consists of four pages somewhat shorter\
        \ and broader than that which the reader now holds in his hand. Where they\
        \ had remained for two centuries nobody knew ; but they began to be talked\
        \ about at the close of the last century \u2014 first in Chalmers' Life of\
        \ Ruddiman, then in the Gentleman's Magazine, then in Nichols' Literary Anecdotes,\
        \ then in DTsraeU's Curiosities of Literature, then in the English edition\
        \ of Beckmann, then in various EngUsh and Foreign Cyclop\xE6dias, and then,\
        \ of course, in cheap popular periodicals. So the pubUc faith remained firm\
        \ that the English Mercurie was the earUest English newspaper. The fair edifice\
        \ was, however, thrown down in 1839. Mr Thomas Watts, the able Assistant Librarian\
        \ at the British Museum, on subjecting the sheets to a critical examination,\
        \ found abundant evidence that the theory of their antiquity was not ten able.\
        \ Manuscript copies of three numbers are bound up in the same volume ; and\
        \ from a scrutiny of the paper, the ink, the handwriting, the type (which\
        \ he recognised as belonging to the Caslon foundry), the literary style, the\
        \ speU ing, the blunders in fact and in date, and the corrections, Mr Watts\
        \ came to a conclusion that the so-called English Mercurie was printed in\
        \ the latter half of the last century. The evidence in support of this opinion\
        \ was col lected in a letter addressed to Mr Panizzi, after wards printed\
        \ for private circulation. Eleven years later, in 1850, Mr Watts furnished\
        \ to the Gentleman's Magazine the reasons which led him to think that the\
        \ fraud had been perpetrated by PhiUp Yorke, second Earl of Hardwicke : in\
        \ other words, that the Earl, for some purpose not now easy to surmise, had\
        \ written certain para graphs in a seemingly Elizabethan style, and caused\
        \ them to be printed as if belonging to a newspaper of 1588. Be this as it\
        \ may, concern ing the identity of the writer, aU who now look at the written\
        \ and printed sheets agree that they are not what they profess to be ; and\
        \ thus a pretty bit of national complacency is set aside ; for we have become\
        \ ashamed of our English Mercuric Mr Knight Hunt, in his Fourth Estate, gives\
        \ us credit, however, for a printed newspaper con siderably more than two\
        \ centuries old. He says : ' There is now no reason to doubt that the puny\
        \ ancestor of the myriads of broad sheets of our tinie was published in 1622\
        \ ; and that the most prominent of the ingenious speculators who offered the\
        \ novelty to the world was Nathaniel Butter. His companions in the work appear\
        \ to have been Nicholas Bourne, Thomas Archer, Nathaniel Newberry, WiUiam\
        \ Sheppard, Bar tholomew Donuer, and Edward Allde. All these different names\
        \ appear in the imprint of the early numbers of the first newspaper, the Weekly\
        \ News. What appears to be the earliest sheet bears the date 23d of May 1622.'\
        \ About 1663, there was a newspaper called Kingdom's Intel ligencer, more\
        \ general and useful than any of its predecessors. Sir Roger L'Estrange was\
        \ connected with it ; but the publication ceased when the London Gazette (first\
        \ called the Oxford Gazette) was commenced in 1665. A few years before this,\
        \ during the stormy times of the Commonwealth, newspapers were amazingly nu\
        \ merous in England ; the chief writers in them being Sir John Birkenhout\
        \ and Mordaunt Need ham. If it were any part of our purpose here to mention\
        \ the names of newspapers which have existed for a longer period than one\
        \ century and a half, we should have to make out a pretty large list. Claims\
        \ have been put forward in this respect for the Lincoln, Rutland, and Stamford\
        \ Mercury, the Scotch Postman, the Scotch Mer cury, the Dublin Neivs-Letter,\
        \ the Dublin Gazette, Pue's Occurrences, Falconer's Journal, and many others,\
        \ some stdl existing, others extinct. The Edinburgh Evening Courant has, we\
        \ believe, never ceased to appear thrice a week (latterly daily) since the\
        \ 15th of December 1718 ; and its rival, the Caledonian Mercury, is but by\
        \ two years less venerable. Saunders's News-Letter has had a vitality in Dublin\
        \ of one hundred and eighteen years, during eighty of which it has been a\
        \ dady paper. In connection with these old newspapers, it is curious to observe\
        \ the original meaning of the terms Gazette and News-Letter. During the war\
        \ between the Venetians and the Turks in 1563, the Venetian Government, being\
        \ desirous of communi cating news on public affairs to the people, caused\
        \ sheets of mditary and commercial intelligence to be written : these sheets\
        \ were read out publicly at certain places, and the fee paid for hearing them\
        \ was a smaU coin caUed a gazzetta. By degrees, the name of the coin was transferred\
        \ to the writ ten sheet ; and an official or government news- faper became\
        \ known as a Gazzetta or Gazetta. 'or some time afterwards, the Venetian Govern\
        \ ment continued the practice, sending several written copies to several towns,\
        \ where they were read to those who chose to listen to them. This", 1]

        \ King William IV., and the darkness of the House, rendered it impossible\
        \ for his Majesty to read the royal speech with facility. Most patiently and\
        \ good-naturedly did he struggle with the task, often hesitating, sometimes\
        \ mis taking, and at others correcting himself. On one occasion, he stuck\
        \ altogether, and after two or three ineffectual efforts to make out the word,\
        \ he was obliged to give it up ; when, turning to Lord Melbourne, who stood\
        \ on his right hand, and looking him most significantly in the face, he said\
        \ in a tone sufficiently loud to be audible in all parts of the House, 'Eh!\
        \ what is it?' Lord Mel bourne having whispered the obstructing word, the\
        \ King proceeded to tod through the speech ; but by the time he got to about\
        \ the middle, the librarian brought him two wax-lights, on which he suddenly\
        \ paused ; then raising his head, and looking at the Lords and Commons, he\
        \ addressed them, on the spur of the moment, in a perfectly distinct voice,\
        \ and without the least embarrass ment or the mistake of a single word, in\
        \ these terms : FATE OF LA CONDAMINE. The leading incidents of the life of\
        \ this emi nent philosopher entitle him to be considered as a martyr of science.\
        \ A native of Paris, upon leaving college he entered the army, and shewed\
        \ great mtrepidity in the siege of Rosas. Upon his return to Paris, he entered\
        \ the Academy of Sciences, as assistant chemist. When the Aca demy were arranging\
        \ for a voyage to the equator, for measuring an arc of the meridian, with\
        \ a view more accurately to determine the dimen sions and figure of the earth,\
        \ La Condamine was fascinated by the project. 'The very desire,' says Condorcet,\
        \ ' of heing connected with so pe rilous an undertaking, made him an astronomer.'\
        \ His proposals having been accepted by the Aca demy, in 1735, in company\
        \ of MM. Bouguer and Godin.he proceeded toreru; on reaehingwhichthe natives\
        \ suspected the philosophers of being either heretics or sorcerers, come in\
        \ search of new gold mines : the surgeon to the expedition was assas sinated\
        \ ; the people were excited against them ; and the country was difficult and\
        \ dangerous. Bouguer and La Condamine and the Spanish Commissioners quarrelled,\
        \ and conducted their operations separately ; but the results did not differ\
        \ from their average by a five-thousandth part of the whole, in the length\
        \ of a degree of the meridian. They encountered great fatigues and hardships,\
        \ until their return in 1743 ; when La Condamine published an account of his\
        \ voyage up the Amazon, and his travels in South America. His determination\
        \ of the figure of the earth, conjointly with Bouguer, appeared later. Among\
        \ his other scientific labours was his propo sition to adopt the length of\
        \ the seconds pendu lum as an invariable unit of measure. On the 4th of February\
        \ 1774, he died while voluntarily undergoing an experimental operation for\
        \ the ' My Lords and Gentlemen, \u2014 ' I have hitherto not been able, from\
        \ want of light, to read this speech in the way its im portance deserves ;\
        \ but as lights are now brought me, I will read it again from the commencement,\
        \ and in a way which, I trust, will command your attention.' The King then\
        \ again, though evidently fatigued by the difficulty of reading in the first\
        \ instance, began at the beginning, and read through the speech in a manner\
        \ which would have done credit to any professor of elocution. Early Lending\
        \ Library.\u2014 In the reign of Henry IV. was built a library in Durham College\
        \ (now Trinity College), Oxford, for the large collection of books of Richard\
        \ of Bury, said to consist of more volumes than all the bishops of England\
        \ had then in then possession. Richard had bestowed certain portions of his\
        \ valuable library upon a company of scholars residing in a Hall at Oxford\
        \ ; and he drew up ' A provident arrangement by which books may be lent to\
        \ strangers,' meaning students of Oxford not belong ing to that Hall. The\
        \ custody of the books was deputed to five of the scholars, of which three,\
        \ and in no case fewer, could lend any books for inspection and use only;\
        \ but for copying and transcribing, they did not allow any book to pass without\
        \ the walls of the house. And when any scholar, whether secular or religious,\
        \ was qualified for the favour, and demanded the loan of a book, the keepers,\
        \ provided they had a duplicate of the book, might lend it to him, taking\
        \ a security exceeding in value the book lent. The reader may smile at the\
        \ caution ; but we have known some possessors of books in our own day to adopt\
        \ similar rules.", 1]

        \ men who adorn the reign of the virgin queen, not one of the least dignified\
        \ figures is that of Sir Thomas Bodley, founder of the public library at Oxford.\
        \ Bodley, in consequence of his father being unable to live in England during\
        \ the reign of Mary, commenced his education at Geneva, and on returning home\
        \ at fourteen was already a good scholar. Entering afterwards at Magdalen\
        \ !ollege, Oxford, he became in succession a fellow of Merton, and the orator\
        \ of the University. At a mature age, he travelled on the Continent, chiefly\
        \ that he might acquire the modern lan guages ; then, returning to his college,\
        \ he devoted himself to the study of history and politics. In 1583, he was\
        \ made gentleman usher to Queen Elizabeth ; and in 1585 he married a rich\
        \ widow of Bristol. From soon after this date untd 1597, Bodley was employed\
        \ by Queen Elizabeth in several embassies and commissions, and he resided\
        \ nearly five years in Holland. It need scarcely be remarked how largely this\
        \ conti nental education, travel, and experience must have qualified Bodley\
        \ for the noble task which he had set himself \u2014 the restoration of the\
        \ public library of the University of Oxford. Bodley, having succeeded in\
        \ all his negotia tions for his royal mistress, obtained his final recall\
        \ in 1597, when, finding his advancement at court obstructed by the jealousies\
        \ and intrigues of great men, he retired from it, and all public business.\
        \ In the same year he set about found ing anew the public library, by offering\
        \ to restore the buildings in which had been depo sited the books and manuscripts\
        \ left by Hum phrey, the good Duke of Gloucester, all of which had been destroyed\
        \ or dispersed before the year 1555, the room continuing empty until restored\
        \ by Sir Thomas Bodley. His offer being gladly accepted, he settled a fund\
        \ for the purchase of books, and the maintenance of proper officers, and commenced\
        \ his undertaking by presenting a large collection of books purchased on the\
        \ Con tinent, and valued at \xA310,000. Other collections and contributions\
        \ followed, to such an amount that the old building was no longer sufficient\
        \ to contain them, when Sir Thomas Bodley proposed to enlarge the edifice\
        \ ; and, his liberal example being followed, the University was enabled to\
        \ add three other sides, forming the quadrangle and rooms for the schools,\
        \ &c. He did not, however, live to see the whole completed. This illustrious\
        \ person died in 1612. The Bodleian Library was first opened to the public\
        \ on the 8th of November 1602. Sir Thomas, then lately knighted, was declared\
        \ the founder; and in 1605, Lord Buckhurst, Earl of Dorset, and Chancellor\
        \ of the University, placed his bust in the library. An annual speech in praise\
        \ of Sir Thomas Bodley was founded in 1681, and is delivered on the visitation-day\
        \ of the library, November the 8th. Casaubon visited the Bodleian Library\
        \ very shortly after the completion of the first building, in 1606. 'None\
        \ of the colleges,' he writes, ' attracted me so much as the Bodleian Library,\
        \ a work rather for a king than a private man. It As you enter the library\
        \ you are struck by an excellent portrait of the founder, by Cornelius Jansen\
        \ ; and by its side and opposite, thoBe of the first principal librarians.\
        \ There are also other portraits of much interest, particularly that of Junius,\
        \ the famous Teutonic scholar, by Vandyck ; of Selden, an exquisite painting\
        \ by Mytens ; and of Humphrey Wanley, some time under-librarian here. The\
        \ ceiling is painted with the arms of the University, and those of Bodley.\
        \ The books in this part of the library retain still their ancient classified\
        \ arrangement, according to Bodley 's will. It would require a volume to enumerate\
        \ the many important additions in books and manu scripts, made to this library\
        \ by its numerous benefactors. The famous library of more than 200 Greek manuscripts,\
        \ formed by Giacomo Baroccio, a Venetian nobleman, was added in 1627, by will\
        \ of Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, then Chancellor of the University. In 1633,\
        \ nearly the same number of manuscripts, chiefly Latin and English, were given\
        \ by Sir Kenelm Digby. Both these collections are supposed to have been presented\
        \ at the instigation of Archbishop Laud, who succeeded the Earl as Chancellor,\
        \ and who himself enriched the library with more than 1300 manuscripts in\
        \ the Oriental and European tongues. The Selden Library, of more than 8000\
        \ volumes of printed books and manuscripts, was next deposited here by Selden's\
        \ executors. In the two succeeding centuries we find among the benefactors\
        \ Junius, Marshall, Hyde, Lord Crewe, Tanner, Bishop of St Asaph, Rawlinson,\
        \ Browne Willis, Thomas Hearne, and God win. Among the subsequent additions\
        \ were the collections of early plays and English poetry, by Malone ; and\
        \ of topography by Gough. To these, prompted by a similar feeling of princely\
        \ munificence, the late Mr Francis Douce added his tastefully collected library\
        \ of printed books and manuscripts, coins and medals, prints and drawings,\
        \ the result of years of patient and un tiring research. The funds of the\
        \ library are kept up by small fees paid by members of the University at their",

        \ made ! \u2014 \"One hundred guineas,\" he exclaimed. Again a pause ensued\
        \ ; but anon the biddings rose rapidly to 500 guineas. Hitherto, however,\
        \ it was evident that the firing was but masked and desultory. At length all\
        \ random shots ceased ; and the champions before named stood gallantly up\
        \ to each other, resolving not to flinch from a trial of their respective\
        \ strengths. \" A thousand guineas \" were bid by Earl Spencer \u2014to which\
        \ the marquis added \" ten.\" You might have heard a pin drop. All eyes were\

        \ See, see ! \u2014 they parry, they lunge, they bet : yet their strength\
        \ is undiminished, and no thought of yielding is entertained by either. Two\

        \ as a prudent general, began to think of a useless effusion of blood and\
        \ expenditure of ammunition \u2014 seeing that his adversary was as re solute\
        \ and \" fresh \" as at the onset. For a quarter of a minute he paused : when\
        \ my Lord Althorp advanced one step forward, as if to supply his father with\
        \ another spear for the purpose of re newing the contest. His countenance\
        \ was marked by a fixed determination to gain the prize \u2014 if prudence,\
        \ in its most commanding form, and with a frown of unusual intensity of expres\

        \ so the obligation is mutual.\" He declared that it was his intention to\
        \ have gone as far as \xA35,000. The noble marquis had previously possessed\
        \ a copy of the same edition, wanting five leaves ; \" for which five leaves,\"\

        \ the fact. At the sale of the Marquis of Blandsord's library in 1819, this\

        \ bound to introduce his extreme religious and political sentiments at every\
        \ opportunity, Hearne made many enemies, and became the butt and jest of the\
        \ ignorant and thoughtless, though he enjoyed the approba tion, favour, and\
        \ confidence of some of his eminent contemporaries. Posterity has borne testimony\
        \ to ses unwearied sedustry and abilities; and it may be said that he united\

        \ of manners. Anxiety to recover ancient manuscripts became in sem a kind\
        \ of religion, and he was accustomed to return thanks in his prayers when\
        \ he made a discovery of this kind. Warton, the laureate, informs us of a\
        \ waggish trick which was once played upon this simple hearted man. There\
        \ was an ale-house at Oxford in his time known by the sign of Whittington\
        \ and his Cat. The kitchen of the house was paved with the bones of sheeps'\
        \ trotters, curiously disposed in compartments. Thither Hearne was brought\
        \ one evening, and shown this floor as a veritable tesselated Eoman pavement\
        \ just dis covered. The Boman workmanship of the floor was not quite evident\
        \ to Hearne at the first glance ; but being reminded that the Standsfield\
        \ Boman pavement, on which he had just published a dissertation, was dedicated\
        \ to Bacchus, he was easily induced, in the antiquarian and classical spirit\
        \ of the hour, to quaff a copious and unwonted libation of potent ale in honour\
        \ of the pagan deity. More followed, and then Hearne, becom ing convinced\
        \ of the ancient character of the pavement, went down upon ses knees to examine\
        \ it more closely. The ale had by this time taken possession of his brain,\
        \ and once down, he proved quite unable to rise again. The wags led the enthusiastic\
        \ antiquary to his lodgings, and saw him safely put to bed. Hearne died in\
        \ his fifty seventh year, and, to the surprise of everybody, was found to\
        \ possess upwards of a thousand pounds, which was divided among his poor brothers\
        \ and sisters. HEAKNE, THE ANTIQUARY. Old Tom Hearne, as he is fondly and\

        \ that even from his earliest youth ' he had a natural and violent propensity\
        \ for antiquarian pursuits.' His father being parish clerk of Little Waltham,\

        struggle in Europe."* Des Cartes founded modern philosophy on the method of
        free reflection. But, two years before Des Cartes startled Europe with his
        discussions on freethinking, Roger Williams asserted the intellectual liberty
        of man and the freedom of the conscience. Des Cartes derived his conclusions
        from doubt of Divine Reve lation: Roger Williams learned his truths from faith
        in God''s written Word. The unbelieving philosopher exalted the specu lations
        of human thought ; the humble Christian student yielded lowly reverence to
        the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Yet, both the Divine and the Philosopher,
        almost simultaneously, in re mote parts of the world, without collusion or
        conference, enun ciated the right of conscience "to obey God rather than men."
        This was the echo of the voice of apostles and martyrs bursting from the caverns
        of the dark ages, where the arrogance of a cor rupt Church, conspiring with
        ignorance and superstition, had choked the soul and suppressed its breathings.
        Acknowledging, as we do, the Providence of God over the affairs of the world,
        and seeing His hand in the progress of civil ization, it is interesting and
        instructive to observe the instru ments which He employs, often of diverse
        materials and oppo site characters, in accomplishing His purpose. In the early
        years of the seventeenth century, Germany was the battle-field for all Europe
        in the wars for Religion ; Holland was torn by infuriate factions ; France
        was arming for a strug gle with bigotry ; England was gasping under the load
        of intol erance. It was the second era of the Reformation, when the emancipated
        mind was resisting the attempts of the usurper to re-enslave it. It was the
        after-birth of the new civilization. Europe demanded one course of treatment,
        America another, to produce sound health. In the Old Countries, institutions

        \ world, that this work was certainly written in the period before Christ,\
        \ as is shown by its style of writing, which is particularly called EpiGRAMMOS,\
        \ by the papyrus, which is of Saitices preparation, and by the ink with which\
        \ it is written (of Alethemicean composition, and called Alethemicon). The\
        \ correct style of the writing confirms my opinion, for no copy of this Periplus\
        \ which exists in the European libraries has so many orthographic variations,\
        \ some of which are very important, and are noted in their proper places.\
        \ I will add the testimony of Dionysios, the metropolitan of Lybia, in his\
        \ work on the homonymous poets and writers : \u2014 \" Hannon was the son\
        \ of Ezoros, the Karchedonian, and uncle of Melampus, twentieth King of Karchedon,\
        \ whom he succeeded after his death (as he died childless), in the fourth\
        \ year of the forty-eighth Olympiad (584 years before Christ), and having\
        \ ruled sixty years over the Karchedonians, died, aged a hundred, as Charon,\
        \ the Naucratean, and Charon, the Kyren\xE6an, relate. Many of the ancient\
        \ historians attributed to this King, the Periplus beyond the Straits of Heracles.\
        \ He composed it in the Ph\u0153nician language, and dedicated it to his paternal\
        \ temple at Karchedon. Many others, and particularly Greeks, translated it,\
        \ but principally Polycleitos, the Kyren\xE6an, who translated it more carefully\
        \ into the Greek language, as is judged from the metropolitan copy in Alexandria.\
        \ This Polycleitos was contemporary with Aristotele. Polycleitos also composed\
        \ the Arch\xE6ology of Kyrene, in three books, and of all Lybia in thirty-four\
        \ volumes. He died at Alexandria, in the second year of the 116th Olympiad\
        \ (315 years before Christ). Besides him there existed others named Hannon,\
        \ as the following : \u2014 First, Hannon, son of Asserymos, from Tyre, who\
        \ wrote about the loss of the Tyrians, as Menandros, the Ephesian, says. Second,\
        \ his nephew, who ruled over the Tyrians the tenth before Heiromos, as Dios\
        \ affirmed. Third, of Apamia, who was an historian, flourishing in the first\
        \ Olympiad. Fourth, the son of Karchedon, who ruled over Karchedon thirty-eight\
        \ years before the first Olympiad. Fifth, the son of Astartos, nephew of Arrhachos,\
        \ King of Karchedon, who succeeded to Arrhachos in the first year of the sixteenth\
        \ Olympiad, as Charon, of Naucratis, mentions. Sixth, the son of Hannon, grandson\
        \ of Ezoros, obtained the power over the Karchedonians for two years, after\
        \ the death of his father, Hannon, in the end of the second year of the sixty-second\
        \ Olympiad. The seventh was the son of Abdemon, who flourished in the eighty-fifth\

        \ in the expedition of Hannibas against Sicily in the third year of the ninety-\

        Borrowers must keep the books clean, and must not write upon, mark or turn
        down leaves. They should take the earliest opportunity of reporting any damage
        or imperfections which they may discover in the books they receive, otherwise
        they will be held responsible. If a book be found to have sustained any damage
        the value will be charged to the last Borrower or his Guarantor. If a book

        are required to protect the books. Books cannot be renewed more than once
        if re- quired by another Borrower, nor can they be exchanged on the day of
        issue. No book can be issued except upon production of the Borrower''s Ticket,
        which must be left at the Library until the book is returned. No person suffering
        from an infectious disease, or resid ing in a house in which there is infectious
        disease, shall be allowed to borrow a book from the Librarv, nor shall any
        person having a book from the Library permit it to be used by anyone suffering

        \ 'STRONG WOMAN.' BISHOP WATSON. Wilstam Hutton, the quaint but sensible Birmingham\
        \ manufacturer, was accustomed to take a month's tour every summer, and to\
        \ note down his observations on places and people. Some of the results appeared\
        \ in distinct books, some in his autobiography, and some in the Gentleman's\
        \ Magazine, towards the close of the last century and the beginning of the\
        \ present. One year he would be accompanied by his father, a tough old man,\
        \ who was not frightened at a twenty-mile walk ; another year he would go\
        \ alone ; whste on one occasion his daughter went with him, she riding on\
        \ horseback, and he trudging on foot by her side. Various parts of England\
        \ and Wales were thus visited, at a time when tourists' facilities were slender\
        \ indeed. It appears from his lists of distances that he could ' do ' fifteen\
        \ or twenty mstes a day for weeks together ; although his mode of examining\
        \ places led to a much slower rate of progress. One of the odd characters\
        \ which he met with at Matlock, in Derbyshste, in July 1801, is worth describing\
        \ in his own words. After noticing the rocks and caves at that town, he said\
        \ : ' The greatest wonder I saw was Miss Ph\u0153be Bown, in person five feet\
        \ six, about thstty, well-proportioned, round faced and ruddy ; a dark penetrating\
        \ eye, which, the moment it fixes upon your face, stamps your character, and\
        \ that with precision. Her step (pardon the Irishism) is more manly than a\
        \ man's, and can easily cover forty miles a day. Her common dress is a man's\
        \ hat, coat, with a spencer above it, and men's shoes ; I believe she is a\
        \ stranger to breeches. She can lift one hundred weight with each hand, and\
        \ carry fourteen score. Can sew, knit, cook, and spin, but hates them ast,\
        \ and every accompaniment to the female character, except that of modesty.\
        \ A gentleman at the New Bath recently treated her so rudely, that \" she\
        \ had a good mind to have knocked him down.\" She positively assured me she\
        \ did not know what fear is. She never gives an affront, but will offer to\
        \ fight any one who gives her one. If she has not fought, perhaps it is owing\
        \ to the insulter being a coward, for none else woistd give an affront [to\
        \ a woman]. She has strong sense, an excestent judgment, says smart things,\
        \ and supports an easy freedom in ast companies. Her voice is more than masculine,\
        \ it is deep toned ; the wind in her face, she can send it a mile ; has no\
        \ beard ; accepts any kind of manual labour, as holding the plough, driving\
        \ the team, thatching the ricks, &c. But her chief avocation is breaking-in\
        \ horses, at a guinea a week ; always rides without a saddle ; and is supposed\
        \ the best judge of a horse, cow, &c, in the country ; and is frequently requested\
        \ to purchase for others at the neighbouring fairs. She is fond of Milton,\
        \ Pope, Shakspeare, also of music ; is sest-taught ; performs on several instruments,\
        \ as the flute, violin, harpsichord, and supports the bass-viol in Matlock\
        \ church. She is an excestent markswoman, and, stke her brother-sportsmen,\
        \ carries her gun upon her shoidder. She eats no beef or pork, and but stttle\
        \ mutton ; her chief food is milk, and also her drink \u2014 discarding wine,\
        \ ale, and spstits.' Richard Watson was eminent as a prelate, politician,\
        \ natural philosopher, and controversial theologian ; but his popular fame\
        \ may be said to depend solely on one stttle book, his Apology for the Bible,\
        \ written as a reply to Paine's Age of Reason. A curious error has been, more\
        \ than once, lately promulgated respecting this prelate. At a telegraphic\
        \ sostee, held in the Free-trade Hall, Manchester, during the meeting of the\
        \ British Association for the Advancement of Science, at that city, in 1861,\
        \ it was confidently asserted that Bishop Watson had given the first idea\
        \ of the electric telegraph. The only probable method of accounting for so\
        \ egregious an error, is that Bishop Watson had been confounded with Sst William\
        \ Watson, who, when an apothecary in London, conducted some electrical experiments\
        \ in 1747, and succeeded in sending the electric current from a Leyden-jar\
        \ through a considerable range of earth, or water, and along wstes suspended\
        \ in the open air on sticks. But, even he never had the slightest idea of\
        \ applying his experiments to telegraphic purposes. In his own account of\
        \ these experiments, he says : ' If it should be asked to what useful purposes\
        \ the effects of electricity can be applied, it may be answered that we are\
        \ not yet so far advanced in these discoveries as to render them conducive\
        \ to the sendee of mankind.' Bishop Watson was elected professor of che mistry\
        \ at the university of Cambridge in 1769 ; and he gives us the following statement\
        \ on the subject : ' At the time this honour was conferred upon me, I knew\
        \ nothing at all of chemistry, had never read a systable on the subject, nor\
        \ seen a single experiment in it ! ' A very fast specimen of the consideration\
        \ hi which physical science was held at the English universities, during the\
        \ dark ages of the last century. .After studying chemistry for fourteen months,\

        \ worker in the field of antiquari anism was the son of the author of that\
        \ strange costection of curious, but ist-authenticated matters, the Wonders\
        \ of the Little World, and was born March 21, 1671-2. He was placed to some\
        \ mechanical business ; but all the time he could command, he employed in\
        \ searching for and reading ancient manuscripts, by copying and imitating\
        \ which he acqusted a particular facility in judging of thest authenticity\
        \ and dates. Dr Lloyd, bishop of Wor cester, pleased with this extraordinary\
        \ taste in so young a person, sent him to Oxford. He was next appointed by\
        \ Harley, Earl of Oxford, to arrange his valuable collections of manuscripts\
        \ and books ; and his lordship's eldest son allowed Wanley a pension, and\
        \ continued hini in his situation of librarian tstl his death. His industry\
        \ as a bibliographer was untsting, and various public libraries and costections\
        \ of manuscripts benefited from his labours. Humphry was a very unselfish\
        \ being, and extremely faithful to his patrons. He was in the habit of costecting\
        \ scarce articles for Lord Oxford's stbrary. One day, having procured a rarity,\
        \ he went to his lordship's town-house, where several cabinet ministers were\
        \ assembled, and Wanley was dessted to wait a few minutes. The weather was\
        \ cold, and he became irritated by the delay ; so he determined to retaliate\
        \ by increasing the price for his treasure. AVhen the ministers departed,\
        \ Wanley was admitted to Lord Oxford. 'I have, my lord,' said Wanley, 'a most\
        \ rare article, but it is very dear. It is the property of a widow, who has\
        \ two daughters ; they have seen better days. She would scarcely permit me\
        \ to bring it, though I left a promissory-note for the hundred pounds she\
        \ demanded, in case I did not return it.' 'A hundred pounds, Wanley; that\
        \ is a great sum for so small a thing ! ' ' It is, my lord ; but you have\
        \ so often asked me to get _ it, that I thought I could not do less than shew\
        \ it your lordship, particularly as it is quite perfect, and is the only copy\
        \ known,' ' It is a large sum ; however, I must have it. Give me pen, ink,\
        \ and paper.' A draught was drawn for a hundred pounds, in presenting which\
        \ his lordship said: 'Now, Wanley, perhaps you purchased this at some bookstast\
        \ ! ' Humphry expressed a seeming surprise, shrugged up his shoulders, and\
        \ left the book with the peer for what he really did give for it at a bookstall\u2014\

        \ by subjecting various matters held in solution to electrical action, he,\
        \ in 1837, hit on a discovery, which, blazoned abroad in the news papers,\
        \ raised round his name a storm of obloquy which happily his hearty good-nature\
        \ enabled him to endure without discomfort. Having mixed two ounces of powdered\
        \ flint with six ounces of carbonate of potassa, fused them together in a\
        \ strong heat, then reduced the com pound to powder, and dissolved it in boiling-water,\
        \ he obtained sistcate of potassa, a portion of which he diluted in boiling\
        \ water, slowly adding hydro chloric acid to super-saturation. This fluid\
        \ he sub jected to a long-continued electric action, through the intervention\
        \ of a porous stone, in order to form, if possible, crystals of silica, but\
        \ this failed. On the fourteenth day from the commencement of the experiment,\
        \ he observed, through a lens, a few smast whitish excrescences projecting\
        \ from the middle of the electrified stone. On the eighteenth day, these projections\
        \ had become enlarged, and struck out seven or eight filaments. On the twenty\
        \ sixth day, they assumed the forms of perfect insects, standing erect on\
        \ a few bristles, which were thest tasts. On the twenty-eighth day they moved\
        \ their legs, and soon after detached themselves from the stone, and began\

        \ The oppressed dissenters took him up as one in whom they might have hopes,\
        \ st legitimacy could be established. So it was not wonderful, when his essentially\
        \ weak character is considered, that he should have set up pretensions to\
        \ the throne against his uncle James IL, though nothing could be for himsest\
        \ more ruinously unfortunate. His ist-starred expedition in June 1685, the\

        \ have ast been rendered familiar to the present generation by the animated\
        \ narration of Macaulay. The exact particulars of his capture are less known,\
        \ and are very interesting. It appears that the duke rode from the field along\
        \ with Lord Gray, and proceeded to Woodyates, where they quitted thest horses,\
        \ and the duke assumed the clothes of a peasant. He then walked on with the\
        \ design of reaching Bournemouth, in order, if possible, to get shipping for\
        \ the continent. An alarm from the appearance of his enemies interrupted this\
        \ plan, and he fled across the country to a wild tract of ground casted Shag's\
        \ Heath. There was here a patch of cultivated ground, divided by hedges, enclosed\
        \ by a ditch, and bearing crops of rye and pease in fust summer growth. It\
        \ bore the name of the Island, by reason that it was entstely surrounded by\
        \ ground in an opposite condition. On the report of a woman, that she had\
        \ seen a man enter that enclosure, the dragoons surrounded it \u2014 ' beat\
        \ ' it in all dstections \u2014 and at length, on the ensuing day, when about\
        \ to depart in despast, lighted upon the would-be king, skulk ing in a ditch\
        \ under fern. The spot is stist indicated with precision by a tree, which\
        \ is popularly called Monmouth's Ash. It was with some difficulty he was identified,\
        \ so great was the change which the mean attire and three days of personal\
        \ neglect, starvation, and terror had wrought upon his once graceful form.\
        \ The woman, Ann Farrant, who had given the information regarding his entering\
        \ the Island, was considered by the peasantry to have never thriven after\
        \ her ungracious act. Amongst the articles found upon Monmouth's person, was\
        \ a little pocket-book containing notes of various journeys, and a number\
        \ of charms or spells. This volume, recovered from a book-stall at Paris,\
        \ was shewn in 1849, at a meeting of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, and\
        \ is now in the British Museum. The charms are found to be for such purposes\
        \ as learning how a sickness is to end, and whether a friend will continue\
        \ faithful ; to heal certain maladies, and make gray hast turn black. There\
        \ are also cabaststic and astrological figures, which have not been explained.\
        \ The character of this part of the contents of the book is in conformity\
        \ with a statement which has come from Colonel William Legge, the officer\
        \ who conducted Monmouth to London after his capture. This gentleman reported\
        \ that, on thest journey, the duke shewed him several charms he had about\
        \ his person, which he said he had got when in Scotland, but which he now\
        \ saw to be only ' foolish conceits.' * It must be admitted that Monmouth\
        \ was not singular in trusting to such conceits. We may here west remember\
        \ that his greater part dry, it is very probable that the weather may change\
        \ to wet about the middle of July, and vice versd. But that any critical meteor\
        \ ological influence resides in the 15th, seems wholly erroneous. Hone, in\
        \ his Everyday Book, quotes an amusing instance of a lady, a stanch believer\
        \ in St Swithin, who, on his day one year being fine, expressed her belief\
        \ in an approaching term of fine weather, but, a few drops of rain having\
        \ fallen in the evening, changed her tune, and maintained that the next six\
        \ weeks would be wet. Her prediction was not accomplished, the weather having\
        \ been remark ably fine. 'No matter,' she would say, when pressed on the point,\
        \ ' if there has been no rain during the day, there certainly has been during\
        \ the night.' Her opinion of St Swithin's infalst bistty was in nowise to\
        \ be shaken. The same author mentions a pretty saying current in some Barts\
        \ of the country when rain falls on St Swithin's \xBBay : ' St Swithin is\
        \ christening the apples.' It is only to be remarked, in conclusion, that\
        \ the epithet of the ' drunken saint,' sometimes appsted to St Swithin, is\
        \ a base slander on the worthy bishop's memory. True, the Saxons were rather\
        \ noted for their convivial habits, and St Swithin, doubtless, had no objection\
        \ to a cheerful glass in moderation. But no aberrations whatever, on the score\
        \ of temperance, are recorded of him. The charge belongs clearly to the same\
        \ category as that veracious statement in the popular ditty, by which St Patrick,\

        \ The character of Porson exhibits an extraordinary combination of the highest\
        \ classical learning and critical acumen, with a strong propensity to coarse\
        \ drollery and convivial excess. His aberrations were indeed in many respects\
        \ more ludicrous than repulsive, and notwithstanding the additional dis advantage\
        \ of a rough and unceremonious temper, we can scarcely find it in our hearts\
        \ to regard him otherwise than as a very honest fellow, who was nobody's enemy\
        \ but his own. A brief sketch will suffice for his history. He was the son\
        \ of the parish clerk of East Ruston, in Norfolk, and having displayed from\
        \ childhood the most marked inclination for study, with a wonder fully tenacious\
        \ memory, he came under the notice of Mr Hewitt, the clergyman of the place,\
        \ who undertook his instruction along with that of his own sons. The weaver's\
        \ boy, for such was the occupation of Porson's father on week-days, con tinued\
        \ to manifest such indications of classical genius, that a subscription was\
        \ entered into in the neighbourhood to defray the further expenses of his\
        \ education. Through these means he was sent first to Eton, and afterwards\
        \ to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a fellowship, but was afterwards\
        \ obliged to relinquish it, from a con scientious objection to enter holy\
        \ orders and sub scribe the Thirty-Nine Articles. He then wended his way,\
        \ a penniless adventurer, to London. Here he is said to have subsisted for\
        \ nearly six weeks on a guinea, but a number of gentlemen, literary men, and\
        \ others, clubbed together at last to purchase him an annuity of \xA3100,\
        \ which placed him beyond the reach of want for the remainder of his days.\
        \ Shortly afterwards, the Greek chair at Cambridge became vacant, and Porson\
        \ was at once elected to the professorship, which required no declaration\
        \ of adherence to any rule of faith. The salary was only \xA340 per annum.\
        \ Though no lectures or other services were required of him, it would seem\
        \ that Porson had fully determined on giving these, but never accomplished\
        \ his intention, partly owing to his own indolence, partly to the failure\
        \ of the college authorities in supplying him with proper rooms and accommodation.\
        \ Most of his subse quent life seems to have been spent in London, where he\
        \ occupied himself with editing the tragedies of Euripides, and contributing\
        \ political squibs to the Morning Chronicle, relaxing himself by con vivialities\
        \ with his friends, and evenings at the 'Cider Cellars.' In 1806, he was chosen\
        \ librarian of the London Institution, with a salary of \xA3200 a year, and\
        \ residence ; but his health had now greatly declined, and in about two years\
        \ after his appointment, he died from the effects of an apoplectic fit, at\
        \ the age of forty-eight. The circumstances connected with Porson's mar riage\
        \ are rather curious. He was very intimate with Mr Perry, the editor of the\
        \ Morning Chronicle, for whom his sister, Mrs Lunan, a widow, kept house.\
        \ One night the professor was seated in his favourite haunt, the Cider Cellars\
        \ in Maiden Lane, smoking a pipe with a friend, when he suddenly turned to\
        \ the latter and said : ' Friend George, do you not think the widow Lunan\
        \ an agreeable sort of personage, as times go ? ' The party addressed replied\
        \ that she might be so. Such was formerly the method of conducting the harvest-feast\
        \ ; and in some instances it is still conducted much in the same manner, but\
        \ there is a growing tendency in the present day, to abolish this method and\
        \ substitute in its place a general harvest-festival for the whole parish,\
        \ to which all the farmers are expected to contribute, and which their labourers\
        \ may freely attend. This festival is usually commenced with a special service\
        \ in the church, followed by a dinner in a tent, or in some building sufficiently\
        \ large, and continued with rural sports ; and sometimes including a tea drinking\
        \ for the women. But this parochial gathering is destitute of one important\
        \ element in the harvest-supper. It is of too general a character. It provides\
        \ no particular means for attaching the labourers to their respective masters.\
        \ If a labourer have any unpleasant feeling towards his master, or is conscious\
        \ of neglecting his duty, or that his conduct has been offensive towards his\
        \ master, he will feel ashamed of going to his house to partake of his hospitality,\
        \ but he will attend without scruple a general feast provided by many con\
        \ tributors, because he will feel under no special obligation to his own master.\
        \ But if the feast be solely provided by his master, if he receive an invitation\
        \ from him, if he finds himself welcomed to his house, sits with him at his\
        \ table, is encouraged to enjoy himself, is allowed to converse freely with\
        \ him, and treated by him with kindness and cordi ality, his prejudices and\
        \ asperities will be dispelled, and\" mutual good-will and attachment established.\
        \ The hospitality of the old-fashioned harvest-supper, and other similar agricultural\
        \ feasts, was a bond of union between the farmer and his work-people of inestimable\
        \ value. The only objection alleged against such a feast, is that it often\
        \ leads to intemperance. So would the harvest-festival, were not regulations\
        \ adopted to prevent it. If similar regulations were applied to the farmer's\
        \ harvest feast, the objection would be removed. Let the farmer invite the\
        \ clergyman of his parish, and other sober-minded friends, and with their\
        \ assist ance to carry out good regulations, temperance will easily be preserved.\
        \ The modern harvest-festival, as a parochial thanksgiving for the bounties\
        \ of Providence, is an excellent institution, in addition to the old harvest\
        \ feast, but it should not be considered as a substitute for it. SEPTEMBER\

        \ Austrian thereon launched out into compliments, saying his cMef reason for\
        \ coming to London was to see and converse with one of the greatest ornaments\
        \ of the age, and one of the most stlustrious phstosophers that ever existed.\
        \ To this high-flown verbiage Cavendish answered not a word, but stood with\
        \ his eyes cast down, abashed and in misery. At last spying an opening in\
        \ the crowd, he flew to the door, nor did he stop tstl he reached Ms carriage,\
        \ and drove dstectly home. .Any attempt to draw him into conversation was\
        \ almost certain to fast, and Dr Wollaston's recipe for treating with him\
        \ usuasty answered best : ' The way to talk to Cavendish is never to look\
        \ at him, but to talk as st it were into vacancy, and then it is not unlikely\
        \ you may set him going.' Professor Playfast, who visited London in 1782,\
        \ and was frequently at the meetings of the Royal Society Club, remarks :\
        \ ' Mr Cavendish is a member of this meeting. He is of an awkward appearance,\
        \ and has not much of the look of a man of rank. He speaks likewise with great\
        \ difficulty and hesitation, and very seldom. But the gleams of genius break\
        \ often through this unpromising exterior. He never speaks at ast, but it\
        \ is exceedingly to the purpose, and either brings some excestent information,\
        \ or draws some important conclusion.' Cavendish's town-house was near the\
        \ British Museum, at the corner of Gower Street and Mon tague Place. Few visitors\
        \ were admitted, and some who were permitted to cross its threshold reported\
        \ that books and apparatus were its chief furniture. He collected a large\
        \ library of scientific stterature, and wisting to have it made useful, but\
        \ not to be troubled with readers and borrowers, he Mred a house for its reception\
        \ in Dean Street, Soho, and kept a librarian. When he wanted one of his own\
        \ books, he went there as to a rirculating stbrary, and left a formal receipt\
        \ for whatever he took away. His favourite residence was a beautstul villa\
        \ at Clapham, nearly the whole of wMch was occupied as workshops. The upper\
        \ rooms were an observatory ; the drawing-room was a laboratory ; and fo an\
        \ ante-room was a forge. On the lawn was a wooden stage, from which access\
        \ could be had to a large tree, to the top of which Cavendish, in the course\
        \ of his astronomical, meteorological, and electrical experiments, occasionasty\
        \ ascended. For beauty he seemed quite indifferent. His apparatus, always\
        \ exact and accurate so far as essential, was constructed of the cheapest\
        \ material, and without any regard for symmetry. His few guests were treated\
        \ on all occasions to the same fare \u2014 a leg of mutton, and nothing else.\
        \ Four scientific men were to dine with him one day, and when his housekeeper\
        \ came to ask him what was to be got for dinner, he said a leg of mutton.\
        \ ' Sir,' said she, ' that wist not be enough for five.' ' Well, then, get\
        \ two,' was his reply. His heir, Lord George Cavendish, visited him once a\
        \ year, and was allowed an audience of but half-an-hour. His great income\
        \ was astowed to accumulate with out attention. The bankers where he kept\
        \ his account found they had a balance of \xA380,000 on hand, and sent a messenger\
        \ to confer with him regarding it. The messenger was announced, and heaven\

        \ and he that beleveth not shal be damned.' HENRY CAVENDISH. Cavendish has\
        \ been called the Newton of chemistry, but we must astow that the title is\
        \ somewhat hyperbolical. Cavendish did not write much ; a few papers in the\
        \ Philosophical Transac tions, between 1766 and 1809, comprise his pub stcations,\
        \ but these were composed with such exquisite care, that it has been said\
        \ each sentence might endure microscopic examination. Sir Humphry Davy, in\
        \ a lecture delivered shortly after the death of Cavendish, observes, 'his\
        \ processes were ast of a finished nature, perfected by the hand of a master\
        \ ; they reqfored no correction ; and though many of them were per formed\
        \ in the very infancy of chemical science, yet their accuracy and beauty have\
        \ remained unimpaired amidst the progress of discovery.' When Cavendish began\
        \ Ms researches, pneumatic chemistry hardly existed. Different gases were\
        \ recognised, but they were considered to be mere modifications or admixtures\
        \ of the common ast. One by one, cautiously and firmly, he fixed truth after\
        \ truth beyond dispute. His most notable acMevement was Ms demonstration,\
        \ in 1781, of the composition of water. Over this discovery there has been\
        \ considerable controversy, some claiming priority for James Watt ; but the\
        \ fact seems to be, that both Cavendish and Watt reached the same conclusion\
        \ about the same time by different routes. The Honourable Henry Cavendish\
        \ was born in 1731, at Nice, whither his mother, Lady Anne Cavendish, had\
        \ repaired for the sake of her health, and she died ere her son was two years\
        \ old. Cavendish was educated at a private school at Hackney, whence he proceeded\
        \ to Cambridge. In early life his tastes were directed to scientific pursuits,\
        \ to the ultimate exclusion of politics, and all else in which ordinary men\
        \ take interest. He became an excellent mathematician, electrician, astronomer,\
        \ meteorologist, geologist, and as a chemist shot far ahead of his contemporaries.\
        \ Up to his fortieth year, his income was mode rate, perhaps not more than\
        \ \xA3500 a year, but in 1773 an uncle died and left him an enormous fortune.\
        \ This accession of wealth did little to change his habits, which had become\
        \ irrevocably established as those of a methodic recluse. His shyness, his\
        \ love of solitude, and aversion to society, bordered on disease. To be looked\
        \ at or addressed by a stranger seemed to give him positive pain, and when\
        \ approached abruptly, he would dart away with a cry or ejaculation as if\
        \ scared or hurt. At Sir Joseph Banks's soirees he would stand for a long\
        \ time on the landing, afraid to open the door and face the company, nor would\
        \ he open it till he heard some one ascending the stairs, and then to escape\
        \ the terror behind faced that in front. At", 1]

        \ was chained to his bedstead ; when he immediately brought actions against\
        \ the proprietor and physi cian. Unfortunately for his case, he stated it\
        \ himself, and lost it. On his third release, he brought an action against\
        \ his sister, from whom he claimed damages to the amount of \xA310,000, for\
        \ authorising his detention. In this suit also he was unsuccessful. In the\
        \ course of his life, he met with many rebuffs in the prosecution of projects\
        \ fo which he restlessly embarked, as he considered, for the public good ;\
        \ for all of which he solaced himself with printing accounts of his motives,\
        \ treatment, and disappointments. One of his eccentricities consisted fo the\
        \ assump tion of the title of Alexander the Corrector. In the capacity implied\
        \ by this term, he stopped persons whom he met in public places on Sundays,\
        \ and admonished them to go home and keep the Sabbath day holy ; and in many\
        \ other ways addressed himself to the improvement of the public morals. He\
        \ spent much of his earnings in the purchase of tracts and catechisms, which\
        \ he distributed right and left ; and gave away some thousands of hand bills,\
        \ on which were printed the fourth command ment. To enlarge, as he thought,\
        \ his sphere of usefulness, he sighed for a recognition of his mission in\
        \ high-places ; and, to attain this end, succeeded, after considerable solicitation,\
        \ in obtain ing the signatures of several persons of rank to a testimonial\
        \ of his zeal for the public good. .Armed with this credential, he urged that\
        \ the king in council, or an act of legislature, should formally constitute\
        \ him Corrector of Morals. Howevei, his chimerical application was not entertained.\
        \ Another eccentricity arose out of the decided part he took against Mr Wstkes,\
        \ when that demagogue agitated the kingdom. He partly expressed his intense\
        \ feestng fo his usual mode \u2014 by pamphlet ; but more especially evinced\
        \ his aversion by effacing the offensive numeral No. 45, wherever he found\
        \ it chalked up. For this purpose, he carried in his pockets a large piece\
        \ of sponge. He subse quently included fo this obliteration all the obscene\
        \ inscriptions with which idle persons were permitted at that time to disgrace\
        \ blank wasts fo the metro polis. This occupation, says his biographer Black\
        \ burn, from its retrospective character, made Ids walks very tedious. His\
        \ erratic benevolence prompted him to visit the prisoners fo Newgate daily,\
        \ instruct them in the teachings of the gospel, and encourage them to pay\
        \ attention, by gstts of money to the most At the close of this year, the\
        \ king, on his return from Holland, where he had not been abstemious, befog\
        \ much out of health, again sent for Radcliffe to Kensington Palace ; when\
        \ his majesty, shewing his swollen ankles, exclaimed : ' Doctor, what think\
        \ you of these?' 'Why, truly,' said Radcliffe, 'I would not have your majesty's\
        \ two legs for your three kingdoms.' With this ill-timed jest, though it passed\
        \ unnoticed at the moment, his professional attendance at court terminated.\
        \ Anne sent again for Radcliffe in the danger ous illness of her husband,\
        \ Prince George. His disease was dropsy, and the doctor, unused to flatter,\
        \ declared that 'the prince had been so tampered with, that nothing in the\
        \ art of physic could keep him alive more than six days' \u2014 and his prediction\
        \ was verified. When, in July 1714, Queen Anne was seized with the sickness\
        \ which terminated her stfe, Rad cliffe was sent for ; but he was confined\
        \ by a fit of gout to his house at Carshalton. He was accused of refusing\
        \ to give his professional advice to his sovereign, and in consequence of\
        \ this report, durst scarcely venture out of doors, as he was threatened with\
        \ being pusted to pieces st ever he came to London. Radcliffe died November\
        \ 1, 1714, 'a victim to the ingratitude of a thankless world, and the fury\
        \ of the gout' By his will he left his Yorkshire estate to University College,\
        \ Oxford, and \xA35000 for enlargement of the building ; to St Bartho lomew's\
        \ Hospital, the yearly sum of \xA3500 towards mending thest diet, and \xA3\

        \ library at Oxford, besides \xA3150 a year for the librarian's salary, \xA3\

  - - ["Life of Oliver Goldsmith. Bob Bryanstone, afterwards, seem to have been his\
        \ only friends. The college life of Goldsmith is not one on which we dwell\
        \ with pleasure. His tutor, the Rev. Theaker Wilder, a man of some mathematical\
        \ ability, was violent in temper, insolent, and overbearing in manners, and\
        \ of a harsh, vicious, and brutal nature. Oliver detested mathematics, and\
        \ so incurred the wrath of his tutor, which the indolence and thoughtlessness\
        \ of the pupil gave too many occasions to gratify. He was subjected to taunts,\
        \ ridicule, and insults almost daily, sometimes even to personal chastisement\
        \ from one who, exercising over him the rights of a master over a servant,\
        \ persecuted him with unremitting rancour. Still Oliver was not without some\
        \ white days in his college career. More than once he received \"the thanks\
        \ of the house\" for his attendance at morning lecture, and this, too, in\
        \ midwinter, at seven o'clock. It is useless to speculate what the young man's\
        \ progress might have been under kindlier treatment. Brutality first outraged\
        \ and then discouraged a sensitive nature. He sought relief from his wretchedness\
        \ sometimes in dissipation, often in reckless disrespect of discipline \u2014\
        \ he wasted his time, neglected his studies, and dissipated the scanty supplies\
        \ which his father could afford him. But even those supplies were soon to\
        \ cease. Early in 1747, that father was snatched from him. How truly the son\
        \ loved and revered the parent is proved in that enduring and pious monument\
        \ which, in after years, he reared to his memory. The image of that father\
        \ seems ever present when he would portray humanity in its loveliest aspects.\
        \ First sketching him, with all his pleasant foibles and large-heartedness,\
        \ in the \" Citizen of the World,\" then recurring to the subject for a fuller\
        \ treatment and a more accurate delineation in the \" Vicar of Wakefield,\"\
        \ and at last lavishing all the riches and all the power of his love in the\
        \ production of that portrait of the pastor in the \"Deserted Village,\" so\
        \ exquisite, so pathetic, so finished, and so lovely, that it seems to this\
        \ hour unrivalled in its excellence. Scant as were the young man's resources\
        \ before, they now become scantier. His widowed mother leaves the parsonage,\
        \ and takes a lodging in Ballymahon, living \" in low circumstances and indifferent\
        \ health, nigra veste senescens ;\" and he is cast pretty much on his own\
        \ ways and means. The genius that brutality checked was quickened at the call\
        \ of \"squalid poverty.\" To supply the pressing wants of daily life, he wrote\
        \ ballads for street minstrels. There was a printer of the name of Hicks who\
        \ Forster adopted it. The building was taken down in 1837, when the portion\
        \ of the pane on which the name was written was preserved, and is now in the\
        \ manuscript room of the college. My friend, the Rev. Dr. Todd, F.T.C.D.,\
        \ the learned librarian, has kindly permitted me to give a facsimile of it\
        \ (the only one ever published) in this work, and' communicated to me the\
        \ history of its preservation. When the buildings were about being taken down,\
        \ Provost Lloyd, at the suggestion of Dr. Todd, had the sash of the window\
        \ on which the name was written removed to the library. \" On examining it\
        \ \" writes the Doctor, \"I thought it was not the genuine scratch, which\
        \ I well remembered, and I mentioned my suspicions to the Provost. Shortly\
        \ afterwards the last occupant of the rooms sent to the Provost the bit of\

        their tutors and governesses. Of course this description will only apply to
        the houses of what the French would call " grand seigneurs," but of these
        there are a much greater number than I should have supposed had I not had
        the best oppor tunity of reckoning them up, having been entertained so frequently
        at their hospitable boards. At an ordinary country house the same order of
        things prevails, though, of course, on a smaller scale. This early dinner
        is followed by that most sociable of meals, a meat-tea; to which friends and
        passing strangers are expected to drop in without any sort of invitation.
        To me, this meat tea was the pleasantest and most sociable meal of the day,
        and under its genial influence the habitual reserve of the most rigid Englishman
        must have thawed in a very short time. To have partaken of one of these meals
        in a house was in itself sufficient to make one feel more like a member of
        the family than a passing stranger. The youngest daughter of the house, would,
        as a rule, station herself behind the urn, and dis pense the tea. As to Polish
        women, who are spoken of in such dis paraging terms all over Germany, I can
        only say that, after long experience of their characters, under ordinary and
        extraordinary circumstances, I no longer wonder at the influence they exercise
        over the men. They are not precisely charming, like French women, or fascinating,
        like the women of Spain or Italy ; but there is au un definable something
        about them, which renders them irresistibly interesting. I shall perhaps best

        I. " If so, come up here, and make an entry of the names and moneys, on this
        sheet of paper." Paul was by my side in an instant ; and in the course of
        a quarter of an hour we had everything complete, so far as the li brary was
        concerned. " Now, then," said I, " you must make your class experiment safe
        for three months at all events, and you will each have to pay your three pence
        per week in advance, for that time, the round sum being three shillings."
        Paul again acted as secretary and treasurer, and thus the most important part
        of the work was done. Nothing remained now to do but to appoint the officers
        ; and it was a rule with me, which my ex perience confirmed as a wise one,
        to make these officers as numerous as possible. For the greater the number
        of official persons, the greater was the personal interest and influence enlisted
        in the suc cess of the society. We soon appointed, therefore, in this case,
        one president, four vice-presidents, one secretary, one librarian, one treasurer,
        an auditor, and twenty-four committee men, who were to meet once a week for
        the transaction of business. I was just upon the point of leaving this assembly
        for the tents of Ishmael, when I was astonished by the apparition of the rector,
        who presented himself in company with the captain of the coast-guard dressed
        in his gold-laced coat. The impudence of this intrusion paralyzed me for the
        moment, and I rubbed my eyes to see if it were not an illusion. There was
        no mistake about it, however ; and in a few moments the rector and his friend
        had advanced close under the desk, facing the audience. There was a commotion
        of no friendly sort amongst the fishermen, and sundry hisses, and at length
        loud cries, of " Wat do ye whant here ? " " Turn t'' parson out ! " " He says
        we ''re nubbut dugs ; an'' would n''t lat uz hev his twenty nine-article scule-rooam,

        rector to explain the occasion of his extraordinary appear ance at this meeting,
        after the insult he offered you in refusing you the use of his old school-room.
        Are you willing to extend to him this courtesy ? For you have a perfect right
        to say if you will hear him or not, this meeting being yours and not his."
        " Did n''t I tell you that the land swarmed with vermin, sir ? " de manded

  - - ["Life of Oliver Goldsmith. Bob Bryanstone, afterwards, seem to have been his\
        \ only friends. The college life of Goldsmith is not one on which we dwell\
        \ with pleasure. His tutor, the Rev. Theaker Wilder, a man of some mathematical\
        \ ability, was violent in temper, insolent, and overbearing in manners, and\
        \ of a harsh, vicious, and brutal nature. Oliver detested mathematics, and\
        \ so incurred the wrath of his tutor, which the indolence and thoughtlessness\
        \ of the pupil gave too many occasions to gratify. He was subjected to taunts,\
        \ ridicule, and insults almost daily, sometimes even to personal chastisement\
        \ from one who, exercising over him the rights of a master over a servant,\
        \ persecuted him with unremitting rancour. Still Oliver was not without some\
        \ white days in his college career. More than once he received \"the thanks\
        \ of the house\" for his attendance at morning lecture, and this, too, in\
        \ midwinter, at seven o'clock. It is useless to speculate what the young man's\
        \ progress might have been under kindlier treatment. Brutality first outraged\
        \ and then discouraged a sensitive nature. He sought relief from his wretchedness\
        \ sometimes in dissipation, often in reckless disrespect of discipline\u2014\
        \ he wasted his time, neglected his studies, and dissipated the scanty supplies\
        \ which his father could afford him. But even those supplies were soon to\
        \ cease. Early in 1747, that father was snatched from him. How truly the son\
        \ loved and revered the parent is proved in that enduring and pious monument\
        \ which, in after years, he reared to his memory. The image of that father\
        \ seems ever present when he would portray humanity in its loveliest aspects.\
        \ First sketching him, with all his pleasant foibles and large-heartedness,\
        \ in the \" Citizen of the World,\" then recurring to the subject for a fuller\
        \ treatment and a more accurate delineation in the \" Vicar of Wakefield,\"\
        \ and at last lavishing all the riches and all the power of his love in the\
        \ production of that portrait of the pastor in the \"Deserted Village,\" so\
        \ exquisite, so pathetic, so finished, and so lovely, that it seems to this\"\
        \ hour unrivalled in its excellence. Scant as were the young man's resources\
        \ before they now become scantier. His widowed mother leaves the parsonage\
        \ and takes a lodging in Ballymahon, living \" in low circumstances and indifferent\
        \ health, nigra veste scnescens ;\" and he is cast pretty much on his own\
        \ ways and means. The genius that brutality checked was quickened at the call\
        \ of \"squalid poverty.\" To supply the pressing wants of daily life, he wrote\
        \ ballads for street minstrels. There was a printer of the name of Hicks who\

        \ Bishop of Norwich, in 1753. In 1766 Archbishop Seeker collated him to the\
        \ rectory of S. Anne's, Westminster, being an option which Dr. Sherlock, Bishop\
        \ of London, had given up by way of compromise to the Primate, to whom he\
        \ had refused a nomination to St. George's, Hanover Square; and in the same\
        \ year Dr. Hind obtained a dispensation to enable him to hold his London along\
        \ with his Shering rectory. He was also appointed domestic chaplain to Dr.\
        \ Terrick, Bishop of London. At this time he was secretary to the Society\
        \ for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts, which office he vacated when\
        \ he left London in 1770. It was whilst rector of St. Anne's that a circumstance\
        \ occurred which threw a gloom over all the rest of his life, and compelled\
        \ him to resign his living to get quit of the Rev. Thomas Martin, his curate,\
        \ to whom he had given a title, and who persistently refused when called upon\
        \ to vacate his curacy. The courts of law, the journals of the day, as well\
        \ as Mr. Martin's scurrilous publications, kept the case several years before\
        \ the public, and, whilst Dr. Hind's conduct may not have been free from blame,\
        \ Mr. Martin's was insufferable. Martin stated that Dr. Hind's proceedings\
        \ against him in the Consistory Court, in Chancery, and in the Common Pleas\
        \ had ruined him, when ultimately, on the last resort to the Court of Delegates,\
        \ the Judge pronounced in favour of Martin's appeal, and annulled the sentence\
        \ of the Ecclesiastical courts, by which Martin declared that he was \" delivered\
        \ from a persecution as cruel, unjust, and op pressive as ever came before\
        \ a court.\" On Dr. Hind's removal to Rochdale in 1778 Martin still pursued\
        \ his victim with remorseless severity, and resorted to the most virulent\
        \ satire and foul personal charges. Dr. Hind was much respected by his Rochdale\
        \ parishioners, and certainly \" lived down \" the charges brought against\
        \ him by his ill-bred London curate. He doubtless regretted the bad judgment\
        \ which had led him into this unhappy litigation, and on coming to his new\
        \ living secured the services of a gentleman who had been curate to his predecessor,\
        \ and who remained in the office for upwards of a quarter of a century afterwards.\
        \ In the same year (1778) he vacated the rectory of Shering, and was presented\
        \ by the Dean and Canons of Christ Church, Oxford, to the vicarage of Skipton\
        \ in Craven, where he never resided, but held at the time of his death, along\
        \ with a prebendal stall (Bloomsbury) in St. Paul's Cathedral, to which he\

        evening. The care shown in the mounting and neat labelling the collection
        which he presented to the Insti tution is noticeable through all he did. His
        catalogues of our Museum, apart from their scientific value, are well worthy
        of inspection as probably unrivalled specimens of neat and methodical work.
        Of all the catalogues of diflerent museums which I have seen I do not recollect
        one which could be in any way considered superior in these respects. Fresh
        views and fresh classifications have to some extent rendered these catalogues
        obsolete, aud our Museum is without a catalogue in harmony with the present
        state of science. Shall we find another William Lonsdale to do for our Museum
        now what was done more than 40 years ago ? On May 15th, 1829, he was elected
        a Fellow of the Geological Society, and in his nomination paper he is described
        as lieutenant. Unfortunately for Bath he was so well known as an energetic
        and painstaking curator that he was appointed curator and librarian of the
        Geological Society of London. His predecessor in that office was Mr. Thomas
        Webster. I cannot learn the exact date of his leaving Bath, but his name is
        first printed as curator and librarian in the " Transactions of the Geological
        Society," vol. iii., part 1, 1829. He held his office from 1829 till 1842,
        when he was succeeded by the celebrated Edward Forbes. His work during this
        period was very important, and on several occasions it received direct acknowledgment
        from the Council of the Society. The care with which he edited the publications
        of the Geological Society has been frequently spoken of with pleasureable
        recollec- tions. That the value of his services in this way may be duly understood
        it should be mentioned that although authors commu- nicating papers to the
        Society are responsible for the views expressed in them, yet the form in which
        they appear when published has always depended much on the editor. The amount
        of supervision exercised has from time to time with different editors varied
        considerably. Lonsdale in this carried matters with a high hand, and not merely
        contented with revising proofs and arranging punctuation, he freely excised

        \ set forth by Lange (Ueber die Kyklisch. Dicht. p. 53-56). Both Lange (p.\
        \ 36-41) however and Ulrici (Geschichte des Griech. Epos, 9te Vorles. p. 418)\
        \ adopt another opinion with respect to the cycle, which I think unsupported\
        \ and inadmissible, \u2014 that the several constituent poems were not re\
        \ ceived into it entire (i. e. with only such changes as were requisite for\
        \ a corrected text), but cut down and abridged in such manner as to produce\
        \ an exact con tinuity of narrative. Lange even ima gines that the cyclic\
        \ Odyssey was thus dealt with. But there seems no evi dence to countenance\
        \ this theory, which would convert the Alexandrine literati from critics into\
        \ logographers. That the cyclic Iliad and Odyssey were the same in the main\
        \ (allowing for cor rections of text) as the common Iliad and Odyssey, is\
        \ shown by the fact, that Proclus merely names them in the series without\
        \ giving any abstract of their contents : they were too well known to render\
        \ such a process necessary. Nor does either the language of Proclus or that\
        \ of C\xE6cius as applied to Zenodotus, indicate any transformation applied\
        \ to the poets whose works are described to have been brought together and\
        \ put into a certain order. The hypothesis of Lange is founded upon the idea\
        \ that the (aKoAovBla irpay pdrwv) continuity of narrated events must necessarily\
        \ have been exact and without break, as if the whole consti tuted one work.\
        \ But this would not be possible, let the framers do what they might: moreover,\
        \ in the attempt, the individuality of all the constituent poets must have\
        \ been sacrificed, in such man ner that it would be absurd to discuss their\
        \ separate merits. The continuity of narrative in the Epic Cycle could not\
        \ have been more than approximative,\u2014 as complete as the poems composing\
        \ it would admit: never theless it would be correct to say that the poems\
        \ were arranged in series upon this principle and upon no other. The librarians\
        \ might have arranged in like", 1]

        the second son, had issue one daughter. Humphry, the third, carried on the
        succession and was one of. the most remarkable men of his family in modern
        times. Humphry Prideaux was born at Padstow in 1648, and received his elementary
        educa tion at Liskeard and Bodmin, and was from the latter place removed to
        Westminster, under the famous Dr. Busby, where he soon became Kings scholar.
        From thence he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, and was admitted a Student
        in that College on 11th December 1668 at the age of 18. He took his degree
        as B.A. in 1672. About this time Lord Henry Howard, then Earl of Norwich,
        afterwards Duke of Norfolk, having given to the University of Oxford the Arundell
        Marbles collected by his grandfather, Thomas Earl of Arundell, it was thought
        desirable to have the inscriptions on them published with explanations, and
        Mr. Prideaux, though at that time very young and only a Bachelor of Arts,
        was selected for the work, which he published in folio two years afterwards,
        viz.: in 1676, under the title " Marmora Oxoniensia", being then just of one
        year''s standing as Master of Arts. This work gained for him a great reputation.
        Being ordered, upon the first publication of the book, to present a copy to
        Lord Chancellor Finch, it procured him an introduction to his Lordship, who,
        in 1679, presented him to the Rectory of St. Clements in Oxford, and continued
        his patron to the end of his life. In 1681 he was appointed to a Prebend in
        the Cathedral at Norwich, and in the following year proceeded B.D., and was
        instituted to the Rectory of Bladen cum Capella de Woodstock, which he held
        with his Studentship of Christ Church in virtue of his being Librarian of
        his College. On 16th February 1685-6 he married, and immediately afterwards
        proceeded D.D. and thereupon exchanged the benefice of Bladen for the Rectory
        of Saham Tony in Norfolk, and settled upon his Prebend at Norwich. In 1688
        he was collated by Dr. Lloyd, Bishop of Norwich, to the Archdeaconry of Suffolk,
        and in 1702 he was appointed to the Deanery of Norwich. He was an earnest
        and able man, and in every office which he filled he not only strove zealously
        to perform his own duties but endeavoured to remove all abuses which he found
        existing. He was the author of several works of learning and ability, among
        them the " Original Divine Right of Tithes", and " Instructions to Churchwardens,"
        but that by which he is chiefly known is his " Connection of the History of
        the Old and New Testa ments", the two latter of which still continue to be
        esteemed as standard works. In his later years Dr. Prideaux was afflicted
        with a distressing and painful disease, and towards the end of his life he
        could no longer use his books. He died at Norwich 1st November 1724, and was
        buried in the cathedral.1 Dean Prideaux left an only surviving son, Edmund,
        who on the death of his cousin Edmund Prideaux of Prideaux Place in 1728,
        s.p., succeeded to his estates, and dying in i From this family of Theuborough
        and Soldon John Prideaux, Bishop of Worcester, would also appear to have derived
        his descent, though we have failed to trace the connection, for in 1621, he
        dedicated his two Sermons entitled "Christ''s Council for ending Law Cases",
        to "The Worshipful my very worthy Kinsman Edmund Prideaux Esq., Counsellor
        at Law, and Mrs. Mary Prideaux his vertous and religious wife." This Edmund
        was created a Baronet of Netherton the next year.', 1]

        \ from the House of Commons and its imme diate adjuncts; and the ventilation\
        \ and warming of the building, with this exception, was left entirely to the\
        \ architect. Appliances have been provided for managing the ventilation of\
        \ the House of Com mons, either by admitting fresh air from large chambers\
        \ when it is mixed and warmed below the floor, which has cast-iron plates\
        \ per forated for this purpose over the whole area \u2014 or from above the\
        \ ceiling through the carved ornament of the beams and spaces left around\
        \ every panel for this purpose. Along both sides of the House are the Division\

        \ in the windows is of less elaborate character than that in the House, but\
        \ in its effect, at least, equally beautiful. There are also Corridors over\

        \ however, are divided by oak framing into different rooms, which are for\
        \ the convenience of members retiring, either to refer to documents or to\

        \ are two small chambers, one for the use of the Members of the Government\

    - ["THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER. 9 In a subsequent Report, the Commissioners were\
        \ of opinion, that six insulated marble statues might be conveniently placed\
        \ in St. Stephen's Porch, and 12 such statues in St. Stephen's Hall. The principal\
        \ portions of the New Palace which it is proposed to decorate, are, the Royal\
        \ Gallery, St. Stephen's Hall, St. Stephen's Porch, the Queen's Robing-Room,\
        \ the Guard-Room, the Peers' Robing-Room, the Prince's Chamber, the Peers'\
        \ and Commons' Corridors, &c\u201E &c, in many of which the decorations have\
        \ been duly completed. The Palace of Westminster occupies an area of about\
        \ eight acres, has four principal fronts, the eastern one being that towards\
        \ the river, aud contains within its area no less than 13 quadrangles or courts\
        \ for the admission of light and air into the numberless rooms, residences,\
        \ and offices, of which, besides the two Houses and their adjuncts, it is\
        \ made up. Some idea may be formed of the intricacy and extent of its plan\
        \ when it is considered that it contains no less than 500 rooms, of all kinds,\
        \ with separate residences, (some of them of large size), for 18 different\
        \ officers of the Houses of Lords and Commons ; the principal of these are\
        \ residences for the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Serjeant-at-Arms,\
        \ the Librarian of the House of Commons, and the Librarian and Usher of the\
        \ Black Rod of the House of Lords. There is also within the building a suitable\
        \ Chapel formed in St. Stephen's crypt, for tbe use of the residents in the\
        \ building. We propose in the following pages, for the guidance of visitors,\
        \ to describe in order all the principal parts of this magnificent pile, as\
        \ well as those portions of the interior to which the public are now admitted.\
        \ EXTERIOR. The most important facade may be said to be that towards the river,\
        \ or East Front ; it is in all 940 ft. in length, of which the projecting\
        \ portions in wings at the extremities are each 120 ft. in length, leaving\
        \ between them a fine paved terrace, overlooking the water, above 700 ft.\
        \ long and 33 ft. wide ; this facade consists of five portions\u2014 the centre,\
        \ which has three stories above the ground door,", 2]
    - ["62 crvpt beneath, with which we have now to do, there are almost none. Some\
        \ of the early Edwards gave banquets in it. After this period it was merelv\
        \ a crypt \u2014 a dull sort of ecclesiastical lumber-room, about which there\
        \ are no records save the doubtful rumours which assign it as a place of meeting\
        \ for Cromwell, Pym, Denzil Holies, and others of the Liberal party, when\
        \ the debates which preceded the Commonwealth were drawing to a violent close.\
        \ From this time forth it seems to have been a lumber-room, which was left\
        \ alone in its dusty silence till used to prepare the coronation banquet of\
        \ one of the early Georges \u2014 a mode of turning it to account which seems\
        \ to have suggested the idea which afterwards was carried out by manv successive\
        \ Speakers of giving their Parliamentary banquets in it. After the fire which\
        \ destroyed St. Stephen's Chapel above it, but did not much injure the crypt,\
        \ the gas meters used to be kept in it, and in the New Palace the site of\
        \ St. Stephen's above the crypt is used in order to obtain an entrance to\
        \ the present structure from Westminster Hall. This Hall is exactly over the\
        \ crypt, which was spared by the fire, and which has now been completely restored\
        \ under the care of the present architect to the New Palace Mr. Edward M.\
        \ Barry. While, in common with all other architects, the late Sir Charles\
        \ Barry lamented the destruction of St. Stephen's Chapel, he always held as\
        \ his most cherished idea, the restoration of the crypt, and its re -dedication\
        \ to religious uses as the private chapel of the New Palace of Westminster,\
        \ whose inmates are some hundreds, now that the Speaker, Black Rod, Sergeant-at\
        \ Arms, Librarians, and other officials possess regular family residences\
        \ within the building, and which, we believe, being necessarily extra-parochial,\
        \ give no legal claim for seats in the neighbouring churches. It is some years\
        \ since this restoration was commenced, and it has fallen to the lot of Sir\
        \ Charles Barry's son to carry out his father's views by completed, restoring\
        \ and decorating the crypt, and nothing now remains to be added except the\
        \ fittings to render it a chapel worthy of the most important Gothic edifice\
        \ of modern times. As it appears now, the Crypt is restored to all its pristine\
        \ splendour of its early erection. Every tone of its rich gold and colour\
        \ decorations have been, wherever they could be traced, most diligently reproduced,\
        \ and the result is a chapel which, in its general richness of effect, will\
        \ bear comparison with any in Europe, with the Sainte Chapelle, with the Chapter\
        \ House of Salisbury Cathedral itself. The date of the erection of St. Stephen's\
        \ Chapel and crvpt is supposed to be from about A.D. 1*290 to A.D. 1345, and,\
        \ though the upper chapel was roofed with wood, the crypt always possessed\
        \ a groined ceiling of stone, with massive ribs and bosses, which have been\
        \ carefully reinstated and restored. The bosses are in most cases original,\
        \ as their fragments have been collected and put to gether again with great\
        \ care. Some of the largest bosses are really medallion groups of historical\
        \ sculpture, and contain representations", 1]

        or series of Historical, Political, nnd Satirical Poems, Ballads, and Pas

        is composed were originally issued as Broadsides and Small Tracts, printed
        in Black-Letter, between the years 1567 and 1591, chiefly during the reign
        of the Earl of Murray as Regent for Mary Queen of Scots and her son James
        the Sixth. They have now been here brought together and Peprinted in a uniform
        style, without the slightest alteration, and thereby made accessible to Antiquaries
        for the first time. No doubt these " Ballates " have been characterized as
        " gross, illiberal, and obscene ;" but they are not unworthy of preser vation.
        Every writing coeval with the great and momentous occurrences of the Sixteenth
        Century must be regarded as interesting, more especially if in any instance
        historical reality can be contrasted with popular belief. Man)- of these Black-
        Letter Broadsides, describing the death of the King Henry Darnley, and the
        Assassination of the " Good Regent" Murray, &c., were scattered amongst the
        people, and the ex asperation of the two parties in the state became daily
        more incurable. On the rarity of these Broadsides it is superfluous to enlarge.
        In many, if not in most, instances they are unique. Few or no Duplicates of
        them are to be met with in Public or Private Libraries ; a circumstance for
        which it is easy to account, if we reflect that they were seldom printed in
        a form calculate. I for preservation. Several of the Poems are Anonymous ;

        \ by the Corporation at 40s. per annum, at which rate it was continued to\
        \ the year 1690, and then a stop was put to payment. Of Eobert Eedwood, who\

        \ before the Town Council the public benefit of establishing another library\
        \ for the townsmen, very little is known. He was a private gentleman of good\
        \ property, residing occasionally in the parish of St. Leonard, and at his\
        \ country house at Congresbury. He was twice married, his first wife being\
        \ the widow of John Carr. the founder of Queen Elizabeth's Hospital. She died\
        \ Nov. 1606, and was buried at St. Werburgh's Church, where he himself also\
        \ lies buried. His will is dated 1630. Upon the title page of some of the\
        \ older books is the autograph of Tobias Matthews, Archbishop of York (A.D.\

        to the general plan and suggestions of Sir Antonio Panizzi, the late chief
        librarian, at a cost of Mr. Sydney Smirke being the architect. It was opened
        in 1857, and has accommo dation for over 300 readers, who are admitted by
        introduction. There are special reading-desks for ladies, who may, however,
        it they prefer, sit among the gentlemen. The height of this grand room is
        140 feet. The British Museum contains about 900,000 volumes, treating upon
        every possible subject. It will, therefore, be readily understood why so many
        students embrace the excep tionable advantages afforded for research. At the
        corner of Museum Street and Oxford Street is Mudie''s celebrated library.
        Monday, Wednesday and Friday, from May to August, from 10 to 6 ; March, April,
        September and October, from 10 to 5 ; November, December, January and February,
        from 10 to 4 free. The Museum is closed for three weeks during the year :
        the first week in January, May and September. Tickets for the Reading Room
        may be had on application with a certificate from two householders in London.
        THE NATIONAL GALLERY (Trafalgar Square), as an architectural building, possesses
        little taste in its design. It is situated, however, in one of the very best
        situations in London, and was founded in the year 1824. It is here that the
        great collection of pictures, purchased by, or given, or bequeathed to the
        nation, are exhibited. Formerly the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy
        were held here, one-half of the building being devoted to that purpose. This
        Gallery is rich in specimens of every school (excepting the Spanish), but,
        in consequence of their being so numerous, it is quite impossible to mention
        even the most noted. A large number of pictures have been presented and bequeathed
        to the institution since its foundation ; whilst over have been expended in
        the purchase of works of art since that time. This building is open to the
        public free on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays ; the students''
        days being Thursdays and Fridays. It closes at 6 in the summer months, at
        5 in the winter. It is usually closed from the middle of September to the
        end of October. 5*', 1]

        S. Clyde, was brought into the Eoads ; and the wounded from both vessels were
        sent on shore. Gooch was asked to assist, which he did ; and in after life
        was accustomed to relate many interesting particulars of cases which then
        came under his observation. Eobert Southey kept up a correspondence with him,
        and in a letter written in 1814 reminds him of a story of a sailor in Yarmouth
        Hospital. In the foUowing year he took his doctor''s degree at Edinburgh ;
        and then returned to Yarmouth. He next became a pupil of Sir Astley Cooper,
        and soon after commenced practice, in which his success was very rapid. Among
        other appoint ments which he obtained, was that of Lecturer at St. Bartholomew''s
        ; and in a few years he became one of the best lecturers in London. His wife
        having died after a short union, Gooch in 1814 married again ; his second
        wife being a sister of Mr. Travers, the eminent surgeon. In 1826, through
        the influence of Sir WiUiam Knighton, he was appointed Librarian to George
        IV. Gooch had attained the first rank in his profession when his health, alwaj''s
        delicate, began to give way. In the summer of 1824 Gooch paid his last visit
        to Yarmouth. He died in 1830 at the early age of 46. Southey, speaking of
        his death, says "I " have lost in Dr. Gooch one of the men in the world for
        whom I had " the greatest regard. He saved this country from having the plague
        "imported, by a paper upon the subject in the Quarterly Review. Never " was
        a man more desirous of doing all in his power towards diminishing " the sum
        of human misery." He was a frequent contributor to the medical periodicals,
        and his writings were held in bigh esteem. In personal appearance Gooch was
        rather below the average height, and his person thin. His dark eyes were reniarkabty
        full and fine ; the habitual expression of his face was that of sagacity tinctured
        with melancholy, occasionaUy exhibiting traces of humour. His manners were
        natural, quiet, and impressive ; and his kindness of heart led him to sympathize
        readily with the feelings of others, and his patients speedily became attached
        to him. He was buried at Croydon. There is an engraved portrait of him. The

        \ he returned to England in 1805, and two years afterwards published an amusing\
        \ View of the present state of Poland. Ultimately he took to opium eating,\

        The library finally landed in the house now owned by the library company,
        on Jordan''s row, and at present occu pied as the internal revenue office.
        In 1865, the present library building was bought by money raised from issuing
        bonds of the company for si.x thousand dollars, aud the books were forthwith
        removed to it. This important occasion is the result of Mr. Thomas Mitchell''s
        enlightened exertions. The following bondholders have, up to the present time,
        given up their bonds, and have accepted, instead, perpetual shares, viz: Benjamin

        of the Kentucky Press Association in Lexington, in January, 1870, the editors
        in attendance re solved to send their various journals free to the library.
        The Lexington Library is an exceedingly valuable one, abounding as it does
        in rare old works, which can not now be obtained elsewhere for any consideration,
        and the good that it has done can not easily be overestimated. The names of

        by James Logue than by any other librarian. He was custo dian of the books
        for more than twenty-five years. Mr. Swift will be remembered for his accurate
        and extensive information and for his extraordinary memory. The in stitution

        Flem ing, a daughter of David, son of Judge Peter Fleming. John Finley was
        born in Rockbridge county, Virginia, January 11, 1797. After acquiring a knowledge
        of the rudi ments of an English education at a country school, he was apprenticed
        to the tanner''s business ; and on the completion of his term of service,
        he emigrated to Indiana, in 1821. Soon after his arrival in Richmond he undertook,
        for a term of years, the management of John Smith''s tannery; but after conducting
        it for a single season, he abandoned it. In 1826, he was married to Rachel
        H. Knott, of Yellow Springs, Ohio, who lived but a few months after marriage.
        In 1830, he was married to Julia Hanson, of Indianapolis. In 1831, he as sumed
        the editorial management of the Richmond Palladium, in which position he continued
        for three years. He was for three years a member of the state legislature,
        and for three years enrolling clerk of the senate. In March, 1537, he was
        elected clerk of the courts of Wayne county for the term of seven years. In
        January, 1852, he was elected mayor of the city of Richmond, and was continued
        in that office by annual re-elections to the time of his death, December 23,
        1866. He w7as buried in Maple Grove Cemetery7, east of the city, in the presence
        of a large concourse of citizens and members of the masonic order, and the
        officers of the city govern ment. Mr. Finley had, by- his first marriage,
        a son, William K. ; by the second, Sarah A., Julia H., Mary F., and John H.
        Sarah A. was married to Benjamin P. Wrigley, who is deceased, and has two
        sons, Roy F. and Luke H. She has been for seven years, and is still, librarian
        of the Morrisson Library. Mary F. married Aaron W. Hibberd, and resides in
        Richmond. John H. enlisted early in the late war, in the Sixteenth Indiana
        Regiment; was promoted to 2d lieutenant, and soon after appointed adjutant
        of the regiment. After the expiration of the term of his enlistment he raised,
        in 1862, a company for the Sixty-seventh Regiment, and was commis sioned captain;
        and in 1863, was made major. While charg ing upon the Rebel works at Vicksburg,
        he received a mortal wound, and died Aug. 26, 1863. He was an estimable young

        bank ing houses were established in Richmond, he invested largely in bank
        stocks, being the owner of one-third of the stock in the Citizens'' Bank.
        He had also a connection w7ith the branches of the State Banks, in Richmond.
        Though rich, he was a friend to the poor. With his declining years his benevolence
        seemed to increase. A portion of his in come went to the relief of the needy
        and suffering. His alms being unostentatiously bestowed, their amount was
        not generally known. The war of the rebellion opened a new field for the exercise
        of Christian philanthropy; and prob ably no man in Richmond contributed more
        liberally than he. Being a life-long member of the society of Friends, he
        was careful not to compromise his long-cherished peace prin ciples. The crowning
        act of his life was the founding of a library, at a cost of $20,000, which
        he transferred as a gift to Wayne township, Richmond included, provision having
        been made for its perpetuation. It is placed under the control of a library
        committee, and kept by a competent lady librarian. He barely lived to see
        this splendid gift executed and the library building completed. A life-size
        portrait painting of the donor was placed iu the public reception room of
        the building, and paid for by contributions of citizens without his knowledge.
        The former township library has been merged in this, which is now probably
        the largest township library in the state. A few years before his death his
        general health be gan to fail ; and he was prevented from mingling with his
        fellow-citizens, and from meeting with his friends in the house of worship.
        In the latter part of the summer of 1865, he was seized with violent illness,
        which soon terminated his life. He died Sept. 12, 1865, aged nearly 79 years.
        A large number of friends, relatives, aud citizens followed his re mains to
        the Friends'' Cemetery, three miles east from Rich mond. His wife died Aug.
        17, 1849, aged nearly 63 years. Robert Morrisson had three children : 1. Hannah,
        who died in 1828, at the age of 20, just after her return from Westtown, Pa.,
        boarding-school. 2. Jonathan, who died in infancy. 3. James L., who succeeded

        Indian relations of the colony had been placed upon a better footing, in so
        far, at least, as the opportuni ties of the French to tamper with them had
        been measur ably cut off. But in December of the succeeding year, owing to
        some intrigues that were never clearly under stood, all these advantages were
        suddenly relinquished by an act of the Crown repealing the measures of Mr.
        Bur net ; reviving, in effect, the execrable trade of the Alba nians, and
        thus at once re-opening the door of intrigue between the French and the Six
        Nations, which had been so wisely closed. The three principal events, however,
        of Montgomery''s administration affecting the city itself, were the grant
        of an amended citv charter in 1730, by which the 1730. jurisdiction of the
        city was fixed to begin at King''s Bridge, the establishment of a line of
        stages to run between New York and Philadelphia once a fortnight during the
        winter months, and the founding of the first public library. For more than
        a century there had been no public library in the city; but in the year 1729
        some sixteen hundred and twenty-two volumes were bequeathed by the Rev. John
        Millington, rector of Newington, England, to the " Venerable Society for the
        Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts," by whom the books were in turn
        imme diately presented to the city. To this number also was added another
        collection, the gift of the Rev. John Sharp, chaplain to Lord Bellamont, when
        both collections, now one, were opened to the public as the '''' Corporation
        Library." The librarian dying soon after, the books were neglected until 1754,

        \ to the personal independence and licensed freedom of the volunteer system,\
        \ and necessarily incident to unpaid serv- ice, but which have tended greatly\
        \ to the present efficiency and compactness of the force, the public are indebted\
        \ to the perseverance and talent for organi- zation possessed by General Shaler,\
        \ with whom they originated, and who urged the necessity of their adoption.\
        \ They are now sanctioned by usage, and are not likely to be abandoned. Their\
        \ effect has been to reduce the material of the Department to the efficiency\
        \ and prompt, quiet, concerted action of regular bat teries of artillery,\
        \ with the substitution of the apparatus for field-pieces. These changes necessarily\
        \ called the attention of the Board to the means of elevating the educational\
        \ standard of the men. After much consideration the Board, on the 27th of\
        \ December, 1867, passed a resolution authorizing me, as a member of the Board,\
        \ to take possession of the large hall above the head-quarter offices of the\
        \ Department, and to organize a lyceum and library for the use of the men,\
        \ provided the same should be done without expense to the public. In compliance\
        \ with this resolution I proceeded at once to interest the insurance companies\
        \ and a few personal friends in the enter prise, and soon secured the moderate\
        \ sum of money necessary to accomplish it. To do this it was necessary to\
        \ husband our resources, and make our pur chases at book sales only, which\
        \ were attended for that purpose very faithfully by Mr. C. E. Gildersleve,\
        \ at that time secretary of the Board. Subsequently, as the collection increased,\
        \ a formal trust was created, by which I hold the prop erty so acquired for\
        \ the use of the firemen of the city of New York. The col lection of books\
        \ has gradually increased, until, at the present time, it includes 4,873 volumes\
        \ belonging to the library, and 1,500 deposited for reference by the trustee.\
        \ The cases in which these books are contained are of walnut, with sliding\
        \ wire-doors and improved fastenings, and are the work of the men of the Department,\
        \ and compare very favorably with those in any public library \u2014 the materials\
        \ for these cases is the only expense to which the Department has been in\

        \ to the use, together with a collection of curiously engraved portraits of\
        \ distinguished Americans, appropriate views, historical documents, autographs,\
        \ maps, Revolutionary currency, &c, &c, have been deposited in the library\
        \ for its use from the private collection of the trustee. To this has been\
        \ added an engine in use by the Department early in the century, and various\
        \ flags, lanterns, certificates, obsolete implements and apparatus, together\
        \ forming a not uninteresting collection, and intended to remind the men not\

        \ and which is constantly increasing by the contributions of old firemen and\
        \ others. The library is divided into chapters of geography and travel, history,\
        \ biography, natural science, and carefully selected fiction, and includes\
        \ such works as are most likely to entertain and improve the leisure hours\

        the second son, had issue one daughter. Humphry, the third, carried on the
        succession and was one of the most remarkable men of his family in modern
        times. Humphry Prideaux was born at Padstow in 1648, and received his elementary
        educa tion at Liskeard and Bodmin, and was from the latter place removed to
        Westminster, under the famous Dr. Busby, where he soon became King''s scholar.
        From thence he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, and was admitted a Student
        in that College on 11th December 1668 at the age of 18. He took his degree
        as B.A. in 1672. About this time Lord Henry Howard, then Earl of Norwich,
        afterwards Duke of Norfolk, having given to the University of Oxford the Arundell
        Marbles collected by his grandfather, Thomas Earl of Arundell, it was thought
        desirable to have the inscriptions on them published with explanations, and
        Mr. Prideaux, though at that time very young and only a Bachelor of Arts,
        was selected for the work, which he published in folio cwo years afterwards,
        viz.: in ! 676, under the title " Marmora Oxoniensia", being then just of
        one year''s standing as Master of Arts. This work gained for him a great reputation.
        Being ordered, upon the first publication of the book, to present a copy to
        Lord Chancellor Finch, it procured him an introduction to his Lordship, who,
        in 1679, presented him to the Rectory of St. Clements in Oxford, and continued
        his patron to the end of his life. In 1681 he was appointed to a Prebend in
        the Cathedral at Norwich, and in the following year proceeded B.D., and was
        instituted to the Rectory of Bladen cum Capella de Woodstock, which he held
        with his Studentship of Christ Church in virtue of his being Librarian of
        his ?e. On 16th February 1685-6 he married, and immediately afterwards proceeded
        D.D. and thereupon exchanged the benefice of Bladen for the Rectory of Saham
        Tony in Norfolk, and settled upon his Prebend at Norwich. In 1688 he was collated
        by Dr. Lloyd, Bishop of Norwich, to the Archdeaconry of Suffolk, and in 1702
        he was appointed to the Deanery of Norwich. He was an earnest and able man,
        and in every office which he filled he not only strove zealously to perform
        his own duties but endeavoured to remove all abuses which he found existing.
        He was the author of several works of learning and ability, among them the
        "Original Divine Right of Tithes", and "Instructions to Churchwardens," but
        that by which lie is chiefly known is his " Connection of the History of the
        Old and New Testa ments", the two latter of which still continue to be esteemed
        as standard works. In his later years Dr. Prideaux was afflicted with a distressing
        and painful disease, and towards the end of his life he could no longer use
        his books. He died at Norwich 1st November 17i;4, and was buried in the cathedral.1
        Dean Prideaux left an only surviving son, Edmund, who on the death of his
        cousin Edmund Prideaux of Prideaux Place in 1728, s.p., succeeded to his estates,
        and dying in 1 From this family , Theuborough and Soldon John Prideaux, Bishop
        of Worcester, would also appear to have derived his descent, though we have
        failed to trace tho connection, for in 1621, he dedicated his two Sermons
        entitled "Christ''s Council for ending Law Cases", to "The Worshipful my very
        worthy Kinsman Edmund Prideaux Esq.. Counsellor at Law, and Mrs. Mary Prideaux
        his vertous and religious wife." This Edmund was created a Baronet of Netherton
        the next year.', 1]

        Eliot ofthe University, and to several members of the Board of Overseers.
        Vice-Admiral Possiet and Mr. Cat acazy entered with Lieutenant-Governor Tucker,
        and were also introduced. Then followed the Governor''s staff and the Boston
        city committee, each in charge of a guest of the ducal suite. After a minute
        or two passed in conversation, and when a few more introductions were made,
        the Duke took the arm of President Eliot and made a tour of the ground floor
        of the library. Mr. Sibley, the ef ficient librarian, reminded the guest of
        the interest his father, the present Czar, had taken in the cause of education
        by presenting to the library a copy of the " Bibliorum Coclex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus,"
        through Mr. De Stoeckl while minister to the United States. The memoirs and
        collections of the Imperial Acad emy at St. Petersburg (one hundred volumes),
        were also shown to His Highness, as a reminder of the importance with which
        the researches and publica tions of that society were viewed. A few minutes
        were passed in sociality, when the party left the li brary, and the Duke and
        suite were driven to Hol worthy Hall, where a brief inspection of the Seniors''
        rooms was made. They then proceeded on foot to the rooms of the Porcellian
        Club, where they re mained a short time. From these rooms they were driven
        to the residence of President Eliot on Quincy Street, where a lunch was partaken
        of. The visitors were followed in their wanderings by a large crowd, but no
        extraordinary demonstration took place further than a hearty salute', 1]

        \ that they had any speeches. And a particular warning also rose to my mind.\
        \ It was this : Some twelve years ago a country man of our own travelling\
        \ in Siberia, published a book iu which he gave an account of his journey.\
        \ He was very hospitably received , and he does not inform us that the custom\
        \ of speeches on such occasions had penetrated into Siberia, but he himself\
        \ was a zealous propagandist, for on oue occasion he made three speeches ou\
        \ one and the same day. His hearers were more fortunate than miue, for his\
        \ speeches were made iu a language they could not understand ; but after he\
        \ had completed his speech \u2014 his speeches, I beg his pardon, \u2014 his\
        \ hearers, they had their revenge, for they took and performed upon him the\
        \ same process which the carriers performed on Sancho Panza, aud they said\
        \ it was the highest compliment they could pay him. And I shall not be discursive,\
        \ especially as I see a strong table-cloth near me. I am reminded of a remark\
        \ of the Baroness de Stael, not the famous baroness, but I may say the unfamous\
        \ Baroness de Stael who preceded her. She said, \" Whenever I am obliged to\
        \ deviate from truth I keep as close to it as I can,\" and whenever I am obliged\
        \ to deviate from silence I shall keep as close to it as I can. (Laughter.)\
        \ I confess it is a great pleasure to every literary mau to welcome here the\
        \ descendant of that remarkable woman who paid one of the highest compliments\
        \ tbat was ever paid to literature : I mean the buying of D'Alembert's library,\
        \ and then making him the librarian. There is something peculiarly picturesque\
        \ in this moruiug-glory, as we may call it, of a nation. It seems to me that\
        \ while we have peculiar rea- sons for feeling well toward Russia, the reasons\
        \ are deeper than we sometimes think. It is not that Russia stands in nearer\
        \ relations to us, is indeed our neighbor over the way, so to speak, especially\
        \ as Russia has given to us Alaska and made us keeper of her seals, if I may\
        \ say so. (Great merriment.) But I think there are deeper rea- sons. I do\
        \ not like to say, after what the President of the University has said, that\
        \ we are a young people. But it seems to me that both Russia and America are\

        \ the house of Mr. WiUiam Everard, a school master and an eminent mathematician\
        \ in St. Paul's Square. About 1756 or 7, the 'Monthly Review' was commenced,\
        \ and the little club agreed to take it in. This led to the purchase of other\
        \ books which were kept in a chest in Mr. Everard's parlour, and began to\
        \ be circu lated amongst the members. This was found so con venient, that\
        \ on May 1, 1758, it was determined to establish a general Circulating Library,\
        \ asserted to be the first of the kind in the kingdom. The first catalogue\
        \ was issued on November 17, 1758, and contained (in cluding pamphlets) 450\
        \ volumes, with 109 subscribers at five shillings per annum each. In 1759\
        \ Mr. Everard commenced business as surveyor and architect, and built himself\
        \ premises on the west side of John Street, a few yards from Cook Street.\
        \ In this building provision was made for the reception of the library, of\
        \ which Mr. Everard was the first secretary and librarian. About 1786, the\
        \ accommodation proving insufficient, a scheme was got up for the erection\
        \ of a building in Lord Street a little below John Street, on the principle\
        \ of a tontine, each subscriber nominating a life, the survivor to take the\
        \ property ; the building to be for public purposes and to provide accommodation\
        \ for the library. In 1787 the library was removed to the new building. It\
        \ may not be without interest to Liverpool readers to mention the names of\
        \ a few of the most prominent members of the institution about this period\

        \ curiosities and works of art. Since that time its precious treasures have\
        \ continued to increase, by donations and purchases made by the trustees,\
        \ including the Royal Library, the Cottonian MSS., the Egyptian antiquities\
        \ by George the Third, and other gifts of valuable prints. The principal purchases\
        \ consist of the Blacas collection, the Townley collection, the Elgin marbles,\
        \ and Sir William Hamilton's collection- To enable the visitor adequately\
        \ to appreciate the various treasures within this \" noble home of art treasures,\"\
        \ great assistance will be derived from an official catalogue, which can be\
        \ bought in the building. The different departments are the Lycian Gallery,\
        \ the Elgin Gallery, Egyptian Antiquities, the Vase and Etrus can Rooms, and\
        \ the Bronzes. Then there is the private room, containing medals, coins, gems,\
        \ cameos and similar treasures, the British and Medi\xE6val Room, the Natural\
        \ History Collection, and the Royal Library. Among the more recent additions\
        \ of great interest is a large part of a huge frustrum of white marble, a\
        \ portion of one of the remarkable columns in front of the Temple of Diana,\
        \ at Ephesus, lodged in the British Museum in August, 1872. Not the least\
        \ interesting part of this great institution is the Reading Room, erected\
        \ according to the general plan and suggestions of Sir Antonio Panizzi, the\
        \ late chief librarian, at a cost of \xA3 150,000, Mr. Sydney Smirke being\
        \ the architect. It was opened in 1857, and has accommo dation for over 300\
        \ readers, who are admitted by introduc tion. There are special reading-desks\
        \ for ladies, who may, however, if they prefer, sit among the gentlemen. The\
        \ height of this grand room is 140 feet. The British Museum contains about\
        \ 900,000 volumes, treating upon every pos sible subject. It will, therefore,\
        \ be readily understood why so many students embrace the exceptional advantages\

        \ The School of Mines was established in 1864, for the purpose of furnishiug\
        \ to students the means of acquiring a thorough knowledge of those branches\
        \ of science which form the basis of the industrial pursuits that are to play\
        \ the most im portaut part in the development of the resources of our country.\
        \ The system of instruction followed in the school includes five parallel\
        \ courses of study, viz : I. Civil engineering. II. Mining eugiueeriug. III.\
        \ Metallurgy. IV. Geology and natural history. V. Analytical and applied chemistry.\
        \ The school is provided with fine mineralogical and geological collections\
        \ ; physical, mechanical, engineering, and mathematical instruments aud models;\
        \ chemical and physical apparatus ; chemical and metallurgical laboratories\
        \ ; and a scientific library and reading-room. These are all sustained by\
        \ liberal annual appropriations, which enable the professors to rapidly increase\
        \ these important means of illustration and practical instruction. Communication\
        \ has been established wish kindred institutions in Europe, and very valuable\
        \ additions to the cabinets and library have already been received from France,\
        \ Belgium, Germany, aud Russia. The success of the School of Mines has surpassed\
        \ the most sanguine expectations of its projectors. The average number of\
        \ pupils for the past three years has been about one hundred, of whom a large\
        \ number are college-graduates. Although the school has been in existence\
        \ but seven years, it has already sent forth fifty-five graduates, most of\
        \ whom have already been appointed to responsible po sitions as mining engineers,\
        \ metallurgists, geologists, chemists, or professors. The officers of the\
        \ school, most of whom were educated in Europe, are satisfied that the school\
        \ now offers to American students every facility'necessary to enable them\
        \ to prepare themselves for any of the professions which involve the practical\
        \ application of the branches of science therein taught ; and that it is no\
        \ longer necessary for young men to visit Europe to study applied science\
        \ ; in fact, that they can be better fitted here for this field of labor,\
        \ which is characterized by peculiar conditions of labor, tran sportation,\
        \ &c. Plan of instruction. \u2014 The plan of instruction pursued in the school\
        \ includes lectures and recitations in the several departments of study ;\
        \ practice in the chemical and metallurgical laboratories ; projects, estimates\
        \ and drawings for the establishment of mines, and for the construction of\
        \ metallurgical and chemical works; reports onmines, industrial establishments,\
        \ and field geology. The course of instruction occupies three years. Those\
        \ who complete it receive the degree of civil engineer, engineer of mines,\
        \ or bachelor of philosophy. For candidates not qualified to enter the first\
        \ year, a preparatory year has been added. The year is divided into two sessions.\
        \ The first commences on the first Monday in October ; the second, on the\
        \ first Thursday iu February. The lectures close on the first Friday in June.\
        \ The annual examinations are then held on all the studies of the year. The\
        \ method of instruction is such that every pupil may acquire a thorough theoret\
        \ ical knowledge of each branch, of which he is required to give evidence\
        \ at the close of the session by written and oral examinations. At the commencement\
        \ of the fol lowing year he is required to show, from reports of works visited,\
        \ that he not only understands the theoretical principles of the subjects\

        \ church, the protestors proceeded to Tanfield Hall, Canonmills, where they\
        \ formed themselves into \" The General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland,\"\
        \ and chose Thomas Chalmers, D.D., as their moderator; so \" the bush burned,\
        \ but was not consumed.\" consisted of four great apartments opening from\
        \ a noble vestibule, with a centre of thirty-five feet : one was for the ordinary\
        \ meetings of the college, and another was an ante-chamber ; but the principal\
        \ apartment was the library \u2014 a room upwards of fifty feet long by thirty\
        \ broad, lighted by two rows of windows, five in each row, facing Rose Street,\
        \ and having a gilded gallery on three sides. On this edifice ,\xA34,800 was\
        \ spent. It was a remarkable instance of the emphatic assertion of religious\
        \ principle in an age of material things cf which St. Andrew's church was\
        \ the scene on the 18th of May. It was no sacri fice of blood or life or limb\
        \ that was exacted, or rendered, as in the days of \" a broken cove nant ;\
        \ \" but it was one well calculated to excite the keenest emotions of the\
        \ people \u2014 for all these clergymen, with their families, cast their bread\
        \ upon the waters, and those who witnessed the dark pro cession that descended\
        \ the long steep street to wards Tanfield Hall never forgot it. In 1 781,\
        \ the library, which had been stored up in the Royal Infirmary, was removed\
        \ to the hall, when the collection, which now greatly exceeds 6,000 volumes,\
        \ was still comparatively in its infancy. Dr. Archibald Stevenson was the\
        \ first librarian, and was appointed in 1683; in 1696 a law was enacted that\
        \ every entrant should con tribute at least one book to the library, which\
        \ was increased in 1 705 \" by the purchase of the books of the deceased Laird\
        \ of Livingstone for about 300 merks Scots;\" and the records show how year\
        \ by year the collection has gone on increasing in extent, and in literary\
        \ and scientific value. Opposite this church there was built the old Physicians'\
        \ Hall \u2014 the successor of the still more ancient one near the Cowgate\
        \ Port. The members of that college feued from the city a large area, extending\
        \ between the south side of George Street and Rose Street, on which they erected\
        \ a very handsome hall, with rooms and offices, from a design by Mr. Craig,\
        \ the architect of the new city itself. The two oldest names on the list of\
        \ Fellows admitted are Peter Kello, date December nth, 1682, and John Abernethy,\
        \ whose diploma is dated June 9th, 1683, granted at Orange, and admitted December\
        \ 4th, 1684, and a wonderful roll follows of names renowned in the annals\
        \ of medicine. The attempt to incorporate the prac titioners of medicine in\
        \ Scotland, for the purpose of raising alike the standard of their character\
        \ and acquirements, originated in 161 7, when James VI. issued an order in\
        \ Parliament for the establishment of a College of Physicians in Edinburgh\
        \ \u2014 an order which recites the evils suffered by the community from the\
        \ intrusion of unqualified practitioners. He further suggested that three\
        \ members of the pro posed college should yearly visit the apothecaries' shops,\
        \ and destroy all bad or insufficient drugs found therein; but the year 1630\
        \ came, and found only a renewal of the proposal for a college, referred to\
        \ the Privy Council by Charles I. But the civil war followed, and nothing\
        \ more was done till 1656, when Cromwell issued a patent, still ex tant, initiating\
        \ a college of physicians in Scotland, with the powers proposed by James VI.\
        \ The foundation stone was laid by Professor CuUen, long a distinguished ornament\
        \ of the Edinburgh University, on the 27th November, 1775, after a long discussion\
        \ concerning two other sites offered by the city, one in George Square, the\
        \ other where now the Scott monument stands. In the stone was placed a parchment\
        \ containing the names of the then fellows, several coins of 1771, and a large\
        \ silver medal. There was also another silver medal, with the arms of the\
        \ city, and an inscription bearing that it had been presented by the city\
        \ to Mr. Craig, in compliment to his pro fessional talents in 1767, as follows\

        \ pally of the College of Surgeons, the universities, the municipality, and\

        \ during the rectorship of John Ray (the friend of Zachary Boyd), who after\
        \ being Professor of Humanity in the university for eight years, regarded\
        \ it promotion to leave it to take full charge of the High School ; and when\
        \ he died, in February, 1630, his office was again con ferred upon a Professor\
        \ of Humanity, Thomas Crawford, who figured prominently amid the pageants\
        \ with which Charles I. was welcomed to the city in 1 633, and with Hawthornden\
        \ and others composed and delivered some of the bombastic speeches on that\
        \ occasion. The roll was then called over, and each boy presented his offering.\

        \ to the money for collecting bent, or rushes, to lay down on the clay floor\
        \ to keep the feet warm and dry; and so lately as the commencement of the\
        \ seventeenth century, during the summer season, the pupils had leave to go\
        \ forth with hooks to cut bent by the margins of Duddingston and the Burgh\
        \ lochs, or elsewhere. \" Happily,\" says Steven, of a later date, \" all\
        \ exactions are now un known ; and at four regular periods in the course of\
        \ each session, the teachers receive from their pupils a fixed fee, which\
        \ is regarded as a fair remuneration for their professional labour.\" In his\
        \ time the number of pupils fluctuated greatly ; he complained to the Council\
        \ that though they had led him to expect \" 400 bairns at the least,\" he\
        \ had only 180 when he began office. But there is no authentic record of attendance\
        \ at that early period ; and it is curious that the abstract of the annual\
        \ enrolment of scholars goes no farther back than the Session of 1738-9, while\
        \ a general matri culation register was not commenced till 1827. In December,\
        \ 1640, Crawford returned to the university, and was succeeded by William\
        \ Spence, schoolmaster of Prestonpans ; but to give all the successive masters\
        \ of the institution would far exceed our space. The masters and scholars\
        \ had very indifferent accommodation during the invasion of Cromwell after\
        \ Dunbar. His troops made a barrack of the school-house, and while there broke\
        \ and burned all the woodwork, leaving it in such a state of ruin that the\
        \ pupils had to meet in Lady Yester's Church till it was repaired by funds\
        \ drawn from the masters of the Trinity Hospital at the foot of Leith Wynd.\
        \ In those days the pupils attended divine service, accompanied by their masters,\
        \ and were frequently catechised before the congregation. A part of Lady Yester's\
        \ Church, was set apart for their use, and afterwards the eastern gallery\
        \ of the Trinity College church. In 1680, the Privy Council issued a proclamation\
        \ prohibiting all private Latin schools to be opened within the city or suburbs,\
        \ and thus the High School enjoyed an almost undisturbed monopoly ; and sixteen\
        \ years after, in the proceedings of the Town Council, we find the following\
        \ enactment : \u2014 A library for the benefit of the institution was added\
        \ to it in 1658, and it now consists of many thousand volumes. Among the first\
        \ donors of books were John Muir the rector, all the masters, Patrick Scott\
        \ of Thirlstane, and John Lord Swinton of that ilk. At present it is sup ported\
        \ by the appropriation of one half of the matriculation fund to its use, and\
        \ every way it is a valuable classical, historical, geographical, and antiquarian\
        \ collection. The rector and masters, with the assistance of the janitor,\

        is enlarged each year by the addition of from two to four hundred new books;
        and the library and reading-room are maintained at a cost to the city of two
        thousand dollars, which sum is raised by taxation. The new charter as amended
        was assigned to Horace Barnes, representing Barnes, Davis & Co., who entered
        into an agreement to have the works completed within six months. On July 2d,
        1868, the present company was formed, and to it the charter was assigned.
        The company was constituted of Edward O. Smith, Henry Prather, Jasper J. Peddecord,
        Lowber Burroughs, William Martin, Fielding N. Ewing, Isaac Shellabarger, Horace
        Barnes and John K. Warren. For this company the works were erected in 1868,
        by Barnes, Davis & Co. Henry Prather was elected presi dent, and J. K. Warren,
        secretary and treasurer. THE CITY PARK. The land now comprising the city park
        was originally a part of Allen & McReynolds'' addition, and was set apart
        by the owners to be donated to the Northern Cross R. R. for depot purposes.
        This, it is needless to say, was never done. It was left until the winter
        of 1858, when the owners, influenced by the persuasive eloquence of Gen. Oglesby,
        donated it to the city for a park, with the proviso, that it should be improved.
        In 1858 it was graded and in the spring of 1859 it was set out in trees. On
        January 15th, 1869, the company were notified by the con tractors that the
        works were completed, and ready to be turned over to the company. On the death
        of Mr. Prather, F. A. Ewing was chosen Presi dent. When Mr. J. K. Warren moved
        to California, Mr. B. K. Durfee, was elected to the office of Secretary and
        Treasurer, which office he still holds. Mr. Ewing declined to be re-elected
        at the expiration of his term on account of ill-health, and Mr. J. K. Warren
        was elected President. The works are on Jackson and Wood streets. The capital
        stock is $81,400, divided into $100 shares, and represents the actual cost
        of construction. J. W. But nian is the Superintendent. The elegant fountain
        in the center, was added iu 1877, aud the pagoda was erected in the spring
        of 1879, for the convenience and comfort of the band. The park is laid out
        in fine trees, and is well shaded, and pro vided with settees. Although small,
        the park is highly beautiful, and is the favorite place of resort for all
        classes. GREENWOOD CEMETERY. DECATUR PUBLIC LIBRARY. This lies unfortunately
        too near the city, being just south within the limits, and contains an area
        of thirty-six acres. Before this was set apart as "God''s acre" the chief
        burying-ground was on the south side of west Main street. There was another
        where the Ger man Catholic Church now stands. In 1839 Dr. W. T. Crissey proposed
        to remove the remains of the dead from the common burying-ground to the place
        now called Greenwood Cemetery, as he wished to lay off the land into town
        lots. Permission being obtained he removed sixteen bodies in the fall of that
        year. The first burial in the new cemetery except those above mentioned, was
        that of Sam uel B. Dewees in February, 1840, the next was that of William
        Pratt, and the next that of Dr. Burrell, both in the spring of 1840. The educational
        influence and value of a free circulating library is very great. The Decatur
        Public Library was opened September 1st, 1875, with sixteen hundred and fifty-seven
        books on the shelves. These and the furniture of the hall were donated to
        the city by the Ladies'' Library Association, which had been in existence
        for about eight years, and had accomplished much good. R. L. Evans was libra
        rian, which important office he still efficiently occupies. To him we are
        indebted for interesting facts and statistics relating to the li brary. The
        board of directors consists of nine persons, three ladies and six gentlemen
        (one of whom must be a member of the council) ap pointed by the city council.
        The present board consists of W. A. Barnes, president, R. R. Montgomery secretary
        and treasurer, Mrs. Judge Green, Mrs. H. Bishop, Miss S. A. Murphy, J. L.
        Peak, W. L. Hammer, David S. Shellabarger and W. T. Wells. The Greenwood Cemetery
        company was incorjxirated in 1854, and the lots were laid out in their present
        shape under the direction of Henry Prather, to whose excellent taste and management
        much of the beauty of this cemetery is due. The number of volumes at this
        time is four thousand and fifty five; an increase of two thousand three hundred
        and ninety-eight since the city accepted control. The library is well selected,
        and while miscellaneous rather than scientific in character, comprises literary
        and scientific works, volumes on art subjects, histories, etc. DECATUR STREET
        RAILWAY. The charter for this railway was obtained in 1869, and the mem bers
        of the company are five in number. The original charter was for a term of
        fifty years, and includes the entire city. Its existence is owing to the far-sighted
        business sagacity of Mr. F. Priest, who built it, and who has, from the inception
        of the project, been the sole manager. The road extends from the Union depot
        along Cerro-Gordo and North Main streets, terminating at the Public Square,
        directly in front of the commodious and popular hotel, the Priest House. Three
        thousand five hundred persons have availed themselves of its privileges since
        1875, more than one-third of the city''s popula tion ; the total number of
        volumes bound for the year ending, MayT the first, 1880, was forty thousand
        six hundred and fifty-nine. The average daily issues were one hundred and
        thirty-seven, and monthly three thousand four hundred and eighty-two. The
        num ber of visitors registered in the same year was sixty-six thousand three
        huudred and sixty-two. The road is well managed, is in good repair, and the
        rolling stock is excellent. A car passes'' over the line every twenty minutes,
        and meets all passenger trains day and night. It has proved a o-reat convenience
        to the traveling public and citizens, and is well patron ized. Mr. Priest,
        the manager of the railway, is also proprietor of the Priest House. The classification
        of circulation, as made by the librarian, is as follows : Works of fiction,
        46.11 per cent. Juvenile literature, 31.77 per cent. Miscellaneous works 22.12
        per eent. There is a commodious and well-furnished reading-room sustained
        in connection with the library, at an annual cost of one hundred and fifty
        dollars. It is supplied with five dailies, twenty-seven The road will be extended
        to other points in the city as soon as the increase of population and consequent
        increase of patronage will justify the outlay.', 1]

        \ by which the Scottish Parliament defined in ample form the rights, immunities,\

        \ \"considering that as a knowledge of the Greek tongue is a valuable piece\

        \ reported that the wire-work in the presses was so wide that students and\
        \ others visiting the museum, \" by putting their fingers into the holes,\
        \ did disorder (the contents), and possibly might embezzle, some of them ;\

        \ when an examination of the students took place before the Town Council and\
        \ the senior members of the college. As the younger men were prepared for\
        \ the perusal of the higher order of Latin Classics, the most of their time\
        \ was passed in read ing the most approved Roman authors, particularly Cicero,\
        \ who in those days was in the greatest repute among the learned. To remedy\
        \ these mischances it was proposed that the wires should be more close. Of\
        \ two cabinets they found that one contained the Materia Medica in three drawers\
        \ ; and as to the other, they knew not what was in it, as it had no keys,\
        \ and they had never seen it opened. The commission offered the further suggestion\
        \ that \"the Rarities purchased in the time of Mr. Henderson's father, such\
        \ as the woman's horn set with silver, and the skeleton, fie., be registrated\
        \ and catalogued by themselves.\" Translations from English into Latin, and\
        \ vice versa, were a regular exercise throughout the whole session, and the\
        \ \" common theme,\" as it was called, was prescribed by the principal towards\
        \ its close\u2014 i.e., the subject of a brief essay to be written in pure\

        \ judgment fell, and a priest and preacher of justice is constituted the patriarch\
        \ of the new world, that the new world might be blessed in the knowledge and\
        \ fear of God. By the confusion of tongues, the inhabitants of the world were\
        \ kept from falling under any one general military despotism, being scattered\
        \ over the earth in the habitations respectively assigned to them, there forming\
        \ separate nations and people. By the choice of the children of Abraham to\
        \ be admitted to the particular covenant of circumcision, the Hebrew people\
        \ were constituted a holy prophet-nation for the benefit of all the other\
        \ people of the earth. They became to them, as it were, the sun in the heavens,\
        \ to set before them the light of their example, and thereby to aid them in\
        \ preserving the knowledge of God handed down to them from the patriarch Noah.\
        \ The various great empires\u2014 those of Assyria, Chaldea, Persia, the Greek\
        \ Empire of Alexander, and, finally, that of the City of Rome \u2014 were\
        \ all in their respective degrees instruments by which the providence of God\
        \ watched over the destinies of the nations, and by which the fulness of time\
        \ for the coming of Christ was prepared. The following are typical passages,\
        \ containing the testimony of their respective witnesses, to the effect that\
        \ God in the beginning gave mankind the gift of a primitive revelation, the\
        \ light of which was by the continual intervention of His Divine providence\
        \ preserved from being entirely lost. The first author to be cited is Gerhardus\
        \ Joannes Vossius, a writer of the sixteenth century, \" De Origine et Progressu\
        \ Idolatri\xE6 ad Veterum Gesta et Rerum Naturam Reduct\xE6,\" libri ix. The\
        \ work exists in two volumes quarto, and is replete with philological learning,\
        \ which, however, often descends into almost trifling minuti\xE6. Gerhardus\
        \ f. q^'^0 Progressu IdoUtn\xE6 \" Although God chose Abraham and his posterity\
        \ by a singular mark of preference to be His people, He by no means on this\
        \ account deprived the other people of His grace, seeing that He preserved\
        \ among them a certain knowledge that God existed, that He governed the world,\
        \ that He was a Being to be worshipped, a reward being promised to His worshippers,\
        \ and a penalty to those who refused. The above constitute the foundation\
        \ of religion considered generally, whence it is said in the Hebrews (xi.\
        \ 6), 'that it is necessary for whoever cometh to God that he should believe\
        \ that He exists, and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.' As a Divine\
        \ Revelation was the source from which these truths were first made known,\
        \ seeing that men in the first instance knew them from God, so in the case\
        \ of those who came after, whom God did not admit to converse with Him, these\
        \ truths assumed the form of a human tradition, which up to the present time\
        \ is found still lingering and vegetating in barbarous nations. And this it\
        \ is that Lactantius speaks of as the testimony of all nations and people,\
        \ who in this one thing are not at variance with each other. It is not, however,\
        \ to be supposed that this consent of the nations rested solely upon the basis\
        \ of tradition \" (De Falsa Religione, book i. chap. ii.). Augustinus Steuchus,\
        \ the second witness, also a writer of the sixteenth century, commonly known\
        \ by the additional name of Eugubinus, was the librarian of the Vatican under\
        \ Paul IV. The following passage is quoted from his learned treatise, in ten\
        \ books, \" De Perenni Philosophia,\" the nature of which the passage itself\
        \ will explain. \" To make a Divine Revelation {i.e., a wisdom communicated\
        \ from God to man) our point of departure, carefully summing up the meaning\
        \ of what has been said, we may lay down, that the wisdom or truth, which\
        \ either came or offered itself from Heaven to men, has progressed by three\
        \ distinct stages. Among the first men it came perfect from God in a large\
        \ and ample measure. Afterwards it came to their successors in a dilapidated\
        \ and torn condition, in part after the manner of a dream or a fable, having\
        \ been, as years advanced, broken up, dismembered, overturned, and subjected\
        \ from the lapse of time to serious injuries at the hands of men. Hence the\
        \ creation of the world, God its author, the beginning, chaos, the sea and\
        \ the living things, the Mind which gives creation its form, the giants, the\
        \ deluge, the Tower of Babel, the affinity subsisting between things Divine\
        \ and things human, all of which were familiarly known in the first times,\
        \ afterwards became either completely unknown, or to such an extent obscure\
        \ and uncertain, that they were held to be little better than fables. When\
        \ philosophers arose, they in part rejected what came before them as being\
        \ fabulous, and in part they handed it on in the same obscure and contaminated\
        \ condition in which they had collected it from its records. In the place\
        \ of very much which they had rejected, they preferred that which they persuaded\
        \ themselves that they had found by the light of their own understandings.\
        \ The consequence was, that truth came to be accounted a fable, and things\
        \ which were obscure and false passed for being true. Thus it came to pass\
        \ that we are able to distinguish Augustinus Steuchus Eugubinus, \" De Perenni\
        \ Philosophic.\"", 1]
    - ["Chap. XV.] Augustus probably acquainted with the writings of Solomon. 221\
        \ acquiesced in the rule of Augustus. Augustus himself, also, as the legislator\
        \ and administrator of an organisation more widely extended than had ever\
        \ before fallen into the hands of one man, seems to sum up in his own person\
        \ the testimony of an entire world, and this, the testimony of a world formed\
        \ upon Roman experience and Greek intelligence, to the truth of the words\
        \ of Solomon, that \" sin brings a people to misery\" (Prov. xiv. 34), and\
        \ the \"throne is established injustice.\" II. Indeed, but for the prevalence\
        \ ofthe \" Hebr\xE6ophobia,\" previously mentioned, nothing would be more\
        \ reasonable than to assume Augustus to have been acquainted with the Septuagint\
        \ version of the Hebrew sacred books, copies of which must, beyond question,\
        \ have already had a place assigned to them in the public libraries of Rome,\
        \ as it is evident that they were known to the librarian Varro.1 A man of\
        \ universal information and literary tastes like Augustus would be little\
        \ likely to be ignorant of their existence; and again, one who has given such\
        \ plain proofs of his clear sense of the burden which he was taking upon himself,\
        \ in assuming the responsible position of leader of the thought, of the legislation,\
        \ and of the reorganisation of the whole Roman world, would certainly not\
        \ be the man to repudiate the light to be derived from the wisdom and experience\
        \ of such a predecessor as the Hebrew monarch, Solomon. And here we are not\
        \ left to simple surmise. A German scholar, a 1 Eusebius, in the Eighth Book\
        \ of his Evangelical Preparation, preserves some interesting details respecting\
        \ the translation of the books of the Hebrew Canon by the seventy interpreters,\
        \ which are not generally known, and which throw a light upon the fact of\
        \ the very much greater diffusion of the knowledge of the Hebrew sacred books\
        \ through the Gentile world than we commonly suppose to be the case. Ptolemy\
        \ Philadelphus (B.C. 2S5-248), king of Egypt for the long and prosperous reign\
        \ of thirty-eight years, was a great friend of arts and literature. His ambition\
        \ was to collect the most rich and extensive library that the Gentile world\
        \ possessed in his city of Alexandria, and he appointed a Greek of the name\
        \ of Demetrius to act as his chief librarian, placing large sums of money\
        \ at his disposal for the purchase of manuscripts and for procuring transcripts\
        \ of works that could not be purchased. Demetrius, in the course of his researches\
        \ had become acquainted with the existence of the books of the Hebrew Canon\
        \ as writings of the greatest value, preserved with the greatest care in Jerusalem,\
        \ and having mentioned them to the king as eminently worthy to have a place\

        \ peculiar to the Hebrews, and that a translation would be necessary. The\
        \ king, upon this, directed Demetrius to investigate the matter, and to report\

        \ that partial and imperfect versions which could not be trusted were not\
        \ unknown, but that the only means of obtaining a satisfactory result was\
        \ for the king to write himself to the High Priest in Jerusalem, requesting\
        \ him to select a company of qualified translators, and allow them to come\
        \ with an authentic transcript of the sacred books to Alexandria, there to\
        \ complete the translation, the fidelity of which was, as far as possible,\
        \ to be guaranteed by the plurality of those engaged upon it, and by their\
        \ acting as a check upon each other. Eusebius preserves the text of the letter\
        \ (quoting it from the work of Arist\xE6us) which Ptolemy addressed to the\
        \ High Priest Eleazar, and the reply of the latter, acceding in a very ample\
        \ and gracious manner to the request of the king. Both letters are remarkable\
        \ documents, and Arist\xE6us, on whose authority they are given, was the envoy\
        \ sent by Ptolemy as the bearer of his letter, and as empowered to conduct\
        \ the negotiations. The king appeals to the proofs of his benevolence to the\

        \ which he will have in complying with all his requests, that the sacrifices\

        \ he had sent six competent men of each tribe, with the transcript of the\

        \ is distinct from the other nations by being the \" manifest portion of God,\"\
        \ and their works are as \" the sun in His sight.\" For what end, then, did\
        \ God create the sun and place it in the firmament? \u2014 \" to give light\
        \ upon the earth \" (Gen. i. 17). The reason why Israel received the prerogative\
        \ of his election was that, like the sun, he should give light to the earth,\
        \ or, to use the more homely language of the Gospel parable, he should be\
        \ the \" candle set on a candlestick to give light to all who are in the house.\"\
        \ Not that God has withheld His revelation of Himself or of His laws and Kis\
        \ judgments from the other people of the earth (He is the common Father of\
        \ all in heaven, how, therefore, could He act thus ?), not that He has failed\
        \ in any way to teach them how to beware of iniquity, or that He has desisted\
        \ to show them the good way in which they should walk, because He made an\
        \ especial choice of the nation of Israel. The reason of the choice of Israel\
        \ is that he may be employed as the prophet and the witness of the Lord of\
        \ Hosts to all the people of the earth, and that thus this one nation may\
        \ be made a source of additional light to the other nations until the promised\
        \ seed should come, \" in whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed\
        \ \" (Gen. xxii. 18). Nothing, then, as we may again and again repeat, more\
        \ intimately concerns the reader of his tory, than that he should be convinced\
        \ of the truth, whomsoever else the popular errors prevalent on this subject\
        \ may have carried away, that the religious traditions of the knowledge of\
        \ the common \" Father in heaven,\" have been largely able to resist all the\
        \ downward tendencies of the long years which St. Paul designates in his public\
        \ address to the Athenians, \" as the times of this ignorance \" (Acts xvii.\
        \ 30). Among no people of the earth have these true traditions been better\
        \ preserved and perpetuated than among the Greeks, and here the providential\
        \ agency of the Hebrew apostolate has proved in proportion as the Gospel times\
        \ drew near of the greatest efficacy ; for though the Messianic traditions,\
        \ which can be traced in the earlier Greek literature of Homer and Hesiod,\
        \ probably belong to the general body of the Gentile tradition, while the\
        \ lofty and elevated character of much of the poetry of the Chorus in the\
        \ Greek dramatic literature, remains for the present an open question, how\
        \ far it is to be pronounced indebted to a light borrowed from the books of\
        \ the Hebrew prophets \u2014 the influence of the Hebrew nation upon the Greek\
        \ schools of philosophy \u2014 rests upon evidence too plain to admit of denial.1\
        \ The Latin language and its literature, belonging as it does to a time of\
        \ the world so much later than the Greek, and formed upon the Greek models,\
        \ comes in a twofold sense within the influence of the Hebrew apostolate,\
        \ first, derivatively through the Greek, and secondly, through the acquaintance\
        \ with the Septuagint Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures, which certainly\
        \ had their place in the public library in Rome, of which the learned T. Varro\
        \ was for many years the librarian, to which it would be an omission not to\
        \ add the presence of the Jewish colony in Rome and their acknowledged social\
        \ influence upon Roman society. The following passage, from an author who\
        \ spent a long life in the constant study of the ancient Greek literature,\
        \ in order to search in it for the traces of the surviving traditions of the\
        \ original Divine revelation, will more than repay a careful perusal : \u2014\
        \ \" But inasmuch as all history is in the last instance a history of religion,\
        \ so Christianity as the universal religion of the entire world has taken\
        \ up into itself every popular religion as far as these have contained elements\
        \ of truth. There is scarcely a single truth clearly enunciated in the Christian\
        \ religion which has not been found, at least in substance, in the world before\
        \ Christ. This truth shall be made to appear in the following 1 Such is the\
        \ testimony of the learned and scholarly Eusebius of C\xE6sarea, who quotes\
        \ proofs at length from the Stromata of Clement of Alexandria in support of\
        \ his judgment (B. vi.). The words of Eusebius are\u2014\" How the Greeks\
        \ borrowed from the barbarous nations we have shown in the foregoing pages,\
        \ in which we have seen how the older Greeks, addicted as they were to laborious\
        \ exploratory travels in distant regions, patched up their own theology out\
        \ of doctrines which they picked up among the barbarous people. So in the\
        \ same manner, in all that has reference to the religion of the one God who\
        \ is supreme over all, and to those branches of learning which are mainly\
        \ directed to the improvement of the mind, and which form the most precious\
        \ portion of philosophy, we shall presently sliow that they (the Greeks) have\
        \ borrowed their knowledge from no other source than from the Hebrews alone\"\
        \ (Euseb. Pr\xE6p. Evang. x. 1).", 1]

        \ July 20, 1824, in Berkeley Co., Va.; he de voted about twenty-seven years\
        \ of his life to the saw-mill business. He finally became insane from unknown\
        \ causes, aud, July 24, 1875, hung himself in his own shed. He was always\
        \ kind to his family, and the last few weeks prior to his suicide he had been\
        \ uncom monly good, and very devoted to 'them. No adverse winds or threatening\
        \ storms seemed to obstruct their passage. It is probable that dyspepsia was\
        \ partially the cause of his insan ity. He was the father of three children,\

        \ machine stood when the student tried what effect elec tricity would have\
        \ on the nerves of a frog. There were frescoes on the outside of the building\
        \ ; and the coats of arms and names of all the noble students who had graduated\
        \ in the university covered the walls of the halls and corridors. I wished\
        \ that we could have spent the whole day there. After dinner we took the cars\
        \ for Florence. The country was very interesting, and when we drew near the\
        \ Apennines it was wild enough. We crossed the Reno, a mountain stream, nineteen\
        \ times ; vvent through twenty-three tunnels, one of which was something more\
        \ than a mile long, and the one through the central ridge of the Apen nines\
        \ one mile and three-quarters. We then went over a long viaduct, winding around\
        \ fearful places, where the cars went on a walk; but they made up for it when\
        \ they reached the plain. Oh! another thing about the university I forgot\
        \ to tell you. I was so absorbed in thoughts of what would be said of such\
        \ female pro fessors in our universities that I forgot to mention Joseph Mezzo\
        \ fanti, who was once librarian there. Pope Gregory XVI. made him a cardinal.\
        \ When he was thirty-six years old he spoke fluently eighteen languages, and\
        \ before his death forty-two. We find everything here very comfortable. Our\
        \ parlor is about thirty feet square ; the fire-place is in one corner of\
        \ the room ; the carpet is a handsome bright Moquet ; large mirror reaching\
        \ from the marble-top table to the ceiling, the frame a foot wide, leaves,\
        \ ornaments, and plume on the top, all gilt ; another mirror of the same size\
        \ over the mantel-piece ; the paper, the ground-work gilt with little artistic\
        \ figures of blue ; sofa and chairs of rich, striped material, \u2014 broad\

        \ instead of being a mere popular narrative. The many fictions of American\
        \ writers will be found corrected and exposed in the following volumes, by\
        \ authorities and facts which cannot be successfully denied. In thus availing\
        \ myself so largely of the proclamations, messages, addresses, letters, and\
        \ records of the times when they occurred, I have only followed the example\
        \ of some of the best historians and biographers. No one can be more sensible\
        \ than myself of the imperfect manner in which I have performed my task, which\
        \ I commenced more than a quarter of a century since, but I have been prevented\
        \ from completing it sooner by public duties \u2014 pursuing, as I have done\
        \ from the beginning, an untrodden path of historical investigations. From\
        \ the long delay, many supposed I would never complete the work, or that I\
        \ had abandoned it. On its completion, therefore, I issued a circular, an\
        \ extract from which I hereto subjoin, explaining the origin, design, and\
        \ scope of the work : \u2014 \" I have pleasure in stating that I have at\
        \ length completed the task which the newspaper press and public men of different\
        \ parties urged upon me from 1855 to 1860. In submission to what seemed to\
        \ be public opinion, I issued, in 1861, a circular addressed to the United\
        \ Empire Loyalists and their descendants, of the British Provinces of America,\
        \ stating the design and scope of my proposed work, and requesting them to\
        \ transmit to me at my expense, any letters or papers in their possession\
        \ which would throw light upon the early history and settlement in these Provinces\
        \ by our U. E. Loyalist forefathers. From all the British Provinces I received\
        \ answers to my circular ; and I have given, with little abridgment, in one\
        \ chapter of my history, these intensely interesting letters and papers \u2014\
        \ to which I have been enabled to add considerably from two large quarto manuscript\
        \ volumes of papers relating to the U. E. Loyalists in the Dominion Parliamentary\
        \ Library at Ottawa, with the use of which I have been favoured by the learned\
        \ and obliging librarian, Mr. Todd. \" In addition to all the works relating\
        \ to the subject which I could collect in Europe and America, I spent, two\
        \ years since, several months in the Library of the British Museum, employing\

        on the Advertiser being taken by Hon. David Mills as editor, while Mr. Wil
        liam Cameron assumed the business management. Under Mr. John Cameron''s direction,
        a policy of rigid economy was adopted in the Globe office, many expenses deemed
        super fluous being cut off. The prevailing idea in the arrange ment of news
        matter is that of brevity and condensation in place of the extended notice
        formerly bestowed on matters of secondary importance. Mr. Cameron has always
        been a Liberal of somewhat advanced views, and an advocate of temperance reform
        and the enlargement of the sphere of woman. He is essentially a man of tact,
        shrewdness and resource, and though criticism has not been silent as to the
        effect of the change upon the style of the great newspaper, the destinies
        of which have been entrusted to his keeping, it must be admitted that he has,
        on the whole, borne well the trying ordeal of comparison with his veteran
        predecessor. Mr. William Houston, the recently appointed Librarian of the
        Ontario Parliamentary Library, was born in the County of Lanark, Ontario,
        on the ninth of September, 1844. He is of Scottish ancestry, his father being
        an Orcadian from Mainland, near Stromness, and his mother of mixed High land
        and Lowland origin from Glasgow. Both parents came to Canada in youth with
        the early settlers of Lanark, and were subjected to the hardships and privations
        incidental to that period. Mr. Houston received only a common school education

        \ called the Herald of the Times. The original proprietors, find ing the business\
        \ not remunerative, or at least uncongenial, the concern was sold to Thomas\
        \ Wright, a substantial real estate owner, who changed the title to the Wilkes-\
        \ Barre Gazette, under which name it was published for several years under\
        \ the editorial management of Josiah Wright, son of the proprietor. As Mr.\
        \ Wright was sub stantially the first printer in Wilkes-Barre, so also was\
        \ he the progenitor of a long line of printers in the valley, down to the\
        \ present time. The Gazette, though small was ably conducted, and grew in\
        \ favor with the people till its list of subscribers exceeded three hundred,\
        \ and it was looked upon as a journalistic success. To us, who are ia the\
        \ habit of reading each morning in the daily papers of the present of the\
        \ happenings in nearly all parts of the world on the preceding day, it may\

        \ within a month of the date of issue, while news from Europe was at least\

        of an institution of this grade. Never was the institution more successful.
        The course of study is most thorough and elevated. The curriculum will compare
        favorably with that of the highest institutions of its class. Notwithstanding
        the depressing influence of monetary panics, and the business derangement
        arising from the recent general suspension in the anthracite regions, this
        time honored and deservedly popular institution receives its full share of
        patronage, and under its present efficient management is destined to exert
        a still more potent in fluence in the education of the youth of our land.
        meeting on the day of the fire resolved that a com mittee of three be appointed
        to draw plans and speci fications for the rebuilding of the seminary. This
        showed the stuff these men were made of. Again did the tried friend of the
        cause, William Swetland, come to the rescue, and he nobly undertook, at his
        own ex pense, the work of rebuilding and enlarging Swetland Hall. Through
        the liberality of P. Pettebone, George Swetland, A. Y. Smith, and Isaac C.
        Shoemaker, a third building was erected about the same time, to which the
        name Union Hall was given. Thus, through fire and disas ter, larger and better
        buildings were erected, and the three blocks, " Wyoming Seminary " in the
        center, with "Swetland Hall" on the left, and "Union Hall" on the right, stood
        a noble monument of the energy and liberality of the men of Wyoming valley.
        The system of instruction adopted is thorough, and designed to prepare the
        students for the active duties of life, or for a course of professional or
        collegiate study. There are nine departments of study provided, and eight
        courses of study are arranged in order to meet the various wants of students:
        The common English course, course in literature and science, classical course,
        college preparatory course, musical course vocal and instrumental, and com
        mercial course. As an evidence of the high grade of scholarship of young men
        prepared here for college, to day they stand among the first at the best colleges
        in the country. Many leading men now distinguished in church and State have
        been educated in this seminary, including Hon. W. W. Ketcham, Governor H.
        M. Hoyt, Hon. H. W. Palmer and Hon. H. B. Payne, Rev. L. C. Floyd and Rev.
        P. Krohn, and that fine pulpit orator Rev. W. P. Abbott, now of New York.
        In a few years afterwards the ladies'' boarding hall was destroyed by fire.
        Then a fierce tornado swept over the place and unroofed the building. Then
        a flood did more or less damage to the seminary property. Yet with heroic
        spirit the board of trustees measured up to every exigency, so that repeated
        difficulties have been overcome, financial embarrassments removed, and the
        whole machinery kept moving without intermission and without a jar. The civil
        war seemed for a brief period to interfere with the wonted success of the
        institution. Yet even with this temporary drawback the trustees projected
        other plans for the success of the school. A commercial department was added
        in 1863; Professor W. S. Smyth, afterward principal of Cazenovia Seminary,
        was secured to take charge of the commercial college, and under his efficient
        supervision it proved a decided success. Pro fessor L. L. Sprague has been
        the head of this depart ment for seven years, and under his management it
        has developed into an institution equal to the best schools of the kind in
        the country. The faculty of the institution is as follows- Rev. David Copeland,
        Ph. D., D. D., principal, intel lectual and moral science. Ellen R. Martin,
        A. M., lady principal, belles lettres. Rev. Levi L. Sprague, principal of
        commercial college and lecturer on commercial law. Rufus B. Howland, B. C.
        E., mathematics and natural science. At the close of the war it was found
        that the enlarge ment of the seminary was absolutely required. The three buildings
        had already been united by the addition of wings, yet this did not meet the
        demand for room. In the year 1866, the centennial of American Methodism, it
        was determined to erect a memorial building, to be named " Centenary Hall."
        This was commenced in 1867 and completed in 1868, at a cost of about $25,000.
        The buildings are all under one roof, three and four stories high, with 350
        feet frontage. The edifice, as a whole, is an ornament to the valley, and
        an honor to the country and the church. There are ample accommodations for
        175 boarding students and 250 day scholars. Rev. Cyrus C. Lovejoy, A. M.,
        ancient languages. Hugo V. Stadler, instrumental and vocal music. Willis L.

        was not insensible to literary merit. Usher, notwithstanding his being a bishop,
        received a pension from him. Marvel and Milton were in his service. Waller,
        who was his relation, was caressed by him. The poet always said, that the
        protector himself was not so wholly illiterate as was commonly ima gined.
        He gave a hundred pounds a year to the divinity professor at Oxford ; and
        an historian mentions this bounty as an instance of his love of literature
        (Neale''s Hist, of the Puritans, vol. iv. p. 123). He intended to have erected
        a college at Durham for the benefit of the northern counties. Civil wars,
        especially when founded on principles of liberty, are not commonly unfavourable
        to the arts of eloquence and composition ; or rather, by presenting nobler
        and more interesting objects, they amply compensate that tranquillity of which
        they bereave the muses. The speeches of the parliamentary orators during this
        period are of a strain much superior to what any former age had produced in
        England ; and the force and compass of our tongue were then first put to trial.
        It must, however, be confessed, that the wretched fanaticism, which so much
        infected the parliamentary party, was no less destructive of taste and science,
        than of all law and order. Gaiety and wit were pro scribed: human learning
        despised : freedom of inquiry detested : cant and hypocrisy alone encouraged.
        It was an article positively insisted on in the preliminaries to the treaty
        of Uxbridge, that all play-houses should for ever be abolished. Sir John Davenant,
        says Whitlocke (p. 639), speaking of the year 1658, published an opera, notwithstand
        ing the nicety of the times. All the king''s furniture was put to sale : his
        pictures, disposed of at very low prices, enriched all the collections in
        Europe : the cartoons, when complete, were only appraised at 300/., though
        the whole collection of the king''s curiosities was sold at above 50,000/.
        (Parl. Hist., vol. xix. p. 83). Even the royal palaces were pulled in pieces,
        and the materials of them sold. The very library and medals at St. James''s
        were intended by the generals to be brought to auction, in order to pay the
        arrears of some regiments of cavalry quartered near London ; but Selden, apprehensive
        of the loss, engaged his friend Whitlocke, then Lord-Keeper of the Com monwealth,
        to apply for the office of librarian. This expedient saved that valuable collection.
        It is, however, remarkable, that the greatest genius by far that shone out
        in England at this period was deeply engaged with these fanatics, and even
        prostituted his pen in theological controversy, in factious disputes, and
        in justifying the most violent measures of the party. This was John Milton,
        whose poems are admirable, though liable to some objections ; his prose writings
        disagreeable, though not altogether defective in genius. Nor are all his poems
        equal. His '' Paradise Lost,'' his '' Comus,'' and a few others shine out
        amidst some flat and insipid compositions. Even in the '' Paradise Lost,''
        his capital performance, there are very long passages, amounting to nearly
        a third of the work, almost wholly destitute of harmony and elegance ; nay,
        of all vigour of imagination. This natural inequality in Milton''s genius
        was much increased by the inequalities in his subject ; of which some parts
        are of themselves the most lofty that', 1]

        Total credit CABINET AND LIBRARY. Through the exertions of Mr. Todd, the late
        county superintendent, there has been accumulated a valuable library and cabinet.
        The following is a history of the 6ame: The Keokuk County Educational Library
        was organized at the first normal institute held in the county, during August,
        1874. The teachers in attendance subscribed one hundred and twelve dollars
        as a fund for pur chasing books. At first the membership fee was fixed at
        twenty-five cents, but at the meeting in January, 1875, it was changed to
        fifty cents. Most of the members at this time, as now, were teachers. A constitution
        and by-laws were adopted, and officers elected, as follows: John Axmear, president;
        Florence Shufflebarger, vice-president; Delia Darling, secretary; J. K. Picket,
        treasurer; H. D. Todd, librarian. The annual dues of each mem ber were first
        fixed at twenty-five cents. The organization prospered, and added many new
        books during the first year. At the meeting, August, 1875, many new members
        joined, when the membership fee was fixed at one dollar, and the annual dues
        at fifteen cents a quarter, or sixty cents a year. Several changes were also
        made in the constitution and by-laws. Each membership or share of stock was
        made transferable at the option of the holder. Educational meetings of the
        Association were held, which added much to the interest. At this ses sion
        ofthe institute, August, 1876, the " Hoosier School-Master" was dramatized,
        and played by a company for the benefit as the library. This enterprise was
        quite successful. The play was repeated the second night, and the association
        realized something near sixty-five dollars from these entertainments. At the
        January meeting, 1877, the membership fee was raised to two dollars, and the
        quarterly fees to twenty-five cents or, one dollar per year. The association
        was incorporated March 10, 1877, and the articles of in corporation are recorded
        in book Y, page 285, in the office of the county recorder. Any one can become
        a member by complying with the regula tions. There are now about one hundred
        members owning about one hundred and fifty shares, several members owning
        more than one share; H. D. Todd owns eleven shares; E. A. Parks, six; John
        Axmear, five; J. K. Pickets, five; W. S. Van Horn, four; Alice Gray, four;
        Joel and John Richardson, two each; Wm. Schriever, two, and several other

        vice-president, secretary, treasurer and librarian. They also constitute the
        board of directors, and are the committee to select books. There are now,
        at this writing, five hundred and fifty seven volumes, treating of a great
        variety of subjects. The historical and biographical works are the most numerous;

        \ first organized, in 1851, with the fol lowing named persons as members:\
        \ Joel Slate and wife, Martin S. Slate, L. E. Slate, H. H. Rodman and wife,\
        \ and S. M. Glandon. The Baptist was the second organization, in 1855. A union\
        \ Sunday-school was organized in the fall of 1857, by a Baptist preacher from\
        \ Iowa City, with the following officers: superintendent, Joel Slate; secretary,\
        \ M. Slate; librarian, S. M. Glandon. It had a library of two hundred volumes.\
        \ The M. E. Church built the first meeting-house, in 1859. The first sermon\
        \ preached was at the funeral of Chambers Rodman, by Father Elliott, a Baptist\
        \ preacher. South English now has three meeting-houses, to-wit: Methodist,\
        \ Baptist and Christian. Webster has two: Methodist and Congregational. White\
        \ Pigeon one: Christian. The first school we have any account of was taught\
        \ by S. M. Glandon in 1851,and the school-house was no modern structure, as\
        \ there were no win dows to it. Webster had the first frame school-house,\
        \ and it is doing duty yet, although built in the fall of 1854. There are\
        \ now ten schools. The first marriage was Lem. Brinor to Miss Dinah Houston,\
        \ in June, 1852, M. S. Slate officiating. The first death was a child of James\
        \ Thomas. The first frame house was built in 1852, by S. M. Slate, and is\
        \ a pretty good house yet. Mr. Slate has lived in the house ever since, until\
        \ last fall, Twenty-three years without moving is something unusual in Iowa.\

        \ the first rail was laid in Iowa, at or near high water mark on the bank\
        \ of the Mississippi, in the city of Davenport. That year the road was completed\
        \ to Iowa City, a distance of about 54\xA3 miles. The first loco motive in\
        \ Iowa was lauded at Davenport in July of the same year, and was called the\
        \ \"Antoine LeClaire.\" The road was then called the Mississippi & Missouri\
        \ Railroad. The first rail was laid at Keokuk, on what was then called the\
        \ Keokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota Railroad, on the 9th day of September,\
        \ 1856, and in October of the same year two locomotives for the road were\
        \ landed at Keokuk from a barge which arrived from Quincy. They were called\
        \ the \" Keokuk \" and the \"Des Moines.\" In the meantime several lines of\
        \ railroad had been projected to cross the State from points on the Mississippi.\
        \ On the 15th of May, 1756, an act of Congress was approved making a grant\
        \ of land to the State to aid in the construction of railroads from Burlington\
        \ to the Missouri river, near the mouth of Platte river ; from Davenport,\
        \ via Iowa City and Fort Des Moines to Council Bluffs; from Lyons northeasterly\
        \ to a point of intersection with the main line of the Iowa Central Air Line\
        \ Railroad, near Maquoketa thence on said main line, running as near as practicable\
        \ on the forty-second parallel across the State to the Missouri river, and\
        \ from Dubuque to a point on the Missouri river at or near Sioux City. The\
        \ grant embraced the sections designated by odd numbers six miles in width\
        \ on each side of the four roads named. Where lands had been sold the State\
        \ was authorized to select other lands equal in quantity from alternate sections\
        \ or parts of sections within fifteen miles of the lines located. The law\
        \ provided certain conditions to be observed by the State in disposing of\
        \ the lands to the railroads for which they were granted. In consequence of\
        \ this grant the governor called a spe cial session ofthe General Assembly\
        \ which convened at Iowa City in July of that year, and on the 14th of the\
        \ same month an act was approved accepting the grant, and regranting the lands\
        \ to the railroads named, on certain speci fied conditions. The roads, with\
        \ the exception of the Iowa Central Air Line, accepted the several grants,\
        \ and located their lines before April 1, 1857, that being a stipulation in\
        \ the act of July 14th. The lands granted to the Iowa Central Air Line road\
        \ were again granted to the Cedar Rapids & Missouri River Railroad Company.\

        the Order hold title to a total of 2,695 acres of arable ground, in the highest
        state of cultivation. Of these 1,800 acres are in the immediate vicinity of
        the abbey, 400 acres of which are in timber, the balance cleared. The remaining
        tracts are located in Table Mound, Iowa and Liberty Townships. The corporation
        is governed by a mitred Abbot, assisted by subordinates, and now contains
        eighty-six members of the Order. The first to direct the destinies of the
        brotherhood was Father Francis Welch, who was followed by Father Clement Smyth,
        dying while Bishop of the diocese of Dubuque; Father James O''Gorman, afterward
        Bishop of Kansas and Nebraska, also deceased, and Father Ephriam McDonnall,
        the present incumbent, up to the date of whose appointment the house was subject
        to the Mother House in Ire land. The present Prior is Father Bernard, with
        Father David Sub-Prior ; Father Alberic, Procurator and Treasurer ; Father
        John Baptist, Librarian, and Father Columbian, Sacristan. In addition to these,
        the following priests are included among the members : Fathers David, Stanislaus,
        Andrew, Garrard, Malachy, Ripal, Augustin, Fidelis, Joseph and Michael. Since
        coming to this country, about twenty-five of the brethren have died, the last
        being Brother John B. Murphy, whose death occurred in Chicago, on the 18th
        of February, 1880. The dead are interred in a cemetery adjoining the frame
        church above mentioned. The value of the property of the corporation is estimated
        at upward of $500,000. ZION REFORMED CHURCH. Zion Reformed Church is located
        on Sec. 16, Cascade Township, four miles southeast of Worthington, and five
        miles northwest of Cascade. The first service by this denomination was held
        here May 25, 1853, by Rev. F. C. Bauman, in the Spring Valley Schoolhouse.
        No stated meetings for worship were held after this until August, 1863, from
        which time onward regular serv ices were held in the above-named schoolhouse,
        by Rev. Bauman, who, on May 27, 1865, effected the organization of a church
        society with a member ship numbering twenty-three, viz.: R. S. Long, Elizabeth
        R. Long, Mary E. McGee, Washington Zarr, Jared Ritter, Margaret Ritter, Christopher

        A building com mittee was appointed, consisting of A. Kissinger, A. Ritter
        and W. Zarr. The corner-stone of the church was laid with appropriate services
        Sep tember 29, 1867. The building was pushed forward to completion, and dedi
        cated October 4, 1868, Rev. J. Riale preaching the dedicatory sermon. The
        cost of the church was about $2,000. It is a fine brick structure, 30x40 feet
        in size. The interior furnishing is plain, yet in neat taste, and well adapted
        for the comfort and convenience of the attending congregation. The church
        has a seating capacity of about 200, the seats being two rows of pews in the
        center and one row on each side, access to all the seats being furnished by
        the two side aisles. The pulpit is supplied with an elegant velvet-covered
        desk, with a lamp-stand on either side for use in evening services. The choir
        seats are found on a. raised platform in the rear of the central pews.', 1]

        \ in the township was, as near as can be ascertained, commenced about 1848,\
        \ in a log cabin on land now owned by S. C. Hall, within two miles of Farley.\
        \ Miss Elizabeth Dickson, of Jones County, directed the studies, exercised\
        \ discipline and rewarded merit to the pupils, who then did not exceed fifteen\
        \ in number. It was a district school supported by the county, and continued\
        \ in the log house for about five years, furnishing the means of education\
        \ to the children of the surrounding country, \u2014 through the agency of\
        \ Miss Dickson, Lucy Harmon, Mr. Bennett, Frank Jewett, and others interested\
        \ in promoting their welfare and improvement. In 1854, a schoolhouse was built\
        \ half a mile nearer Farley, by J. G. Wilson, at which Orrin Paine, Minerva.\
        \ Benson, Mr. Freal and Miss Jane Miller taught. This lasted five years, but,\
        \ in 1859, the location was again changed to a frame hut on Wood, opposite\
        \ Tenth street, where it remained until the stone hall was built, when it\
        \ was moved there. In August, 1868, the present schoolhouse, at the corner\
        \ of Tenth and Langworthy streets, was partially completed, and possession\
        \ taken the same year. It was subsequently finished entire, costing a total\
        \ of $2,600, and is now devoted to the objects for which it was put up, the\
        \ lower floor being used for the primary and intermed iate departments, while\
        \ the upper story is devoted to the high school. Three teachers are employed,\
        \ and the average daily attendance of pupils is in the vicinity of 140, who\
        \ are thus afforded an opportunity to acquire a thorough knowledge of the\
        \ rudiments of education, as also familiarity with the more advanced branches.\
        \ The school is supported by taxation together with the semi-annual apportion\
        \ ments of the State, and costs about $1,500 per annum to run it. The tax\
        \ for school purposes is about 10 mills on the dollar, assessments amounting\
        \ to $90,000 being set apart for that purpose, its uses being directed by\
        \ a School Board at present composed of the following gentlemen : P. F. Walker,\
        \ President; S. Goodale, J. G. Wilson, C. C. Doherty, W. W. Haller and A.\

        \ Farley with a view to enlisting the sympathies of citizens in an enterprise\
        \ of that character. He remained a week, and secured fifteen subscribers.\
        \ Thereupon, a meeting was convened, at which it was decided to build up a\
        \ library in the town, and, after the disposal of some preliminary business,\

        \ the sale of lots would be accompa nied by a demand for lumber, which the\

        \ having been in early days a staunch Whig, and afterwards one of the organizers\
        \ of the Republican party. While a resident of the town of Charleston he held\
        \ the position of justice and supervisor, and in 1847 was elected a representative\
        \ of Kalamazoo County in the State Legislature, serving one term ; while living\
        \ in Ross he served as supervisor several terms, and in 1852 was elected county\
        \ treasurer, serving in that position four suc cessive terms ; in 1865 he\
        \ was appointed by Governor Crapo quartermaster-general of the State, serving\
        \ in that position for three years. In his private and official life he has\
        \ always stood high in the county as a man of strict integrity, and few men\
        \ in the county have stronger personal friends. ISRAEL KELLOGG. Among the\
        \ old residents of Kalamazoo, Israel Kellogg deserves remembrance, for he\
        \ has been a busy worker and prominent citizen for many years, and contributed\
        \ a full share to the growth and prosperity of the place. He was born in New\
        \ Canaan, Columbia Co, N. Y, near the western line of Massachusetts, in 1798.\
        \ When eight years of age the family removed to the town of Warren, Herkimer\
        \ Co., lying in the historic valley of the Mohawk, adjoining the celebrated\
        \ \"German Flats.\" In 1817 the family once more removed to Clayton, Jefferson\
        \ Co, N. Y, and this time to the banks of the finest and grandest river on\
        \ the globe, \u2014 the noble and majestic St. Lawrence. ALEXANDER J. SHELDON.\
        \ When the history of those men who by their individual efforts have done\
        \ most for Kalamazoo and its improvement shall be written, the name of Alexander\
        \ J. Sheldon should be first. Mr. Sheldon came to Kalamazoo in 1843, and for\
        \ nearly ten years carried on the book business, for which he was peculiarly\
        \ adapted, both by years of experience in Buf falo, N. Y, and by his literary\
        \ tastes. In 1845 he turned his attention to the improvement of this village,\
        \ then with out a sidewalk or street-crossing of any kind, without a fire\
        \ department, and with scarcely a village government. Within four years by\
        \ his energy he had brought order and beauty out of confusion and unsightliness.\
        \ He laid down the first walk, in front of the Episcopal church, at his own\
        \ cost, beginning a system of village improvements then unknown in any town\
        \ in the State save Detroit. The people, having full confidence, appointed\
        \ him village marshal, and he was allowed to do whatever in his judgment he\
        \ saw fit to do. He started a revolution, and the neatness, order, and pride\
        \ of the village may date from his movements. Sidewalks extended, crossings\
        \ were put down, mud-holes were filled, trades were established, cattle were\
        \ taken from the streets, the park was converted from mere commons and pasture\
        \ to a well-regulated inclosed park, with hundreds of shade trees planted\
        \ upon it, and throughout the village. He drafted a new charter and ordinances\
        \ for the government of the municipality, and placed the village on the best\
        \ pos sible basis for the times and the population, and from that time her\
        \ habits, her character, and her progress date. So with the fire companies\
        \ ; he was the first chief engineer, and he gave time, money, and ability\
        \ to the encouragement of efforts which he inspired in behalf of fire protection\
        \ ; he originated and promoted the building of Firemen's Hall and the two\
        \ plank-roads. He did ..very much towards the building up of the first Episcopal\
        \ Church ; he gave freely to any and all purposes which would redound to the\
        \ advan tage and the good name of Kalamazoo. He was prominent in all enterprises\
        \ of that day. He built a fine store, kept a large and excellent stock of\
        \ books and stationery ; he helped others, he was everybody's friend, and\
        \ was himself always poor. Elsewhere we speak of him as an editor and Mr.\
        \ Kellogg first visited Michigan in 1836, and pur chased land, but not in\
        \ Kalamazoo County. He visited Berrien County in the fall of that year, but\
        \ returned to New York. He was at Kalamazoo for about one year, in 1839-40,\
        \ but returned to Berrien County, where he re mained for two years, when he\
        \ again came to Kalamazoo and made it his permanent home. He was for ten years\
        \ land lord of the famous Kalamazoo House, probably from about 1842 to 1852,\
        \ and when the old original frame building was removed and the modern brick\
        \ one erected in its place, he had the contract, and erected the new hotel.\
        \ He was also the first building superintendent of the Michigan Asylum for\
        \ the Insane, and erected a large portion of the original buildings. About\
        \ 1874, Mr. Kellogg became owner of the old \" Academy\" building, which stood\
        \ in the park until about 1857, and in which the Kalamazoo branch of the State\
        \ University was located for several years. The buildiug now stands on Willard\
        \ Street, between Cooley and West Streets, and is still in a good state of\
        \ repair. For the past five years Mr. Kellogg has been an invalid, having\
        \ been stricken down by paralysis ; but he is still quite vigorous in his\
        \ mental faculties, and preserves a good recollection of events, though his\
        \ memory is defective as to exact dates. His life has been long and active.\

        general approval and added much to their interest. After the history lesson
        is completed, and a short intermission given, each lady repeats a quotation,
        embracing often the most exquisite gems of thought, which are thus made fa
        miliar to the members. Facts bearing on general subjects are then related,
        and questions asked which may be answered at the succeeding meeting. A mutual
        desire for improve ment, together with much kindly feeling, have bound the
        society together since its organization and made it prosperous. The Woman''s
        Christian Temperance Union of Augusta was organized, under the auspices of
        0. H. Perry, of Kala mazoo, in March, 1877. The preliminary meetings were
        held at the Baptist church, which were largely attended and awakened much
        interest. Soon after an organization was effected, with Mrs. A. F. Tyndall
        as President; Mrs. M. Taggart, Vice-President; Miss Hobart, Secretary ; and
        Mrs. T. C. Wood, Treasurer. The Union was not only actively engaged in the
        cause of temperance, but was also closely identified with Christian work in
        the village. At the first annual meeting, held April 5, 1877, the fol lowing
        were the officers chosen : Mrs. C. E. Ives, President ; Mrs. L. J. Brown,
        Vice-President ; Miss Mary Warmington, Secretary. The following were the officers
        for the succeed ing year : Mrs. C. E. Ives, President ; Mrs. E. D. Town, Vice-President
        ; Mrs. H. D. Pool, Secretary. The present officers are Mrs. C. E. Ives, President
        ; Mrs. H. D. Pool, Vice-President ; Mrs. A. L. Griffin, Secretary. A suite
        of rooms were secured, neatly furnished, and provided with wholesome reading-matter,
        and a cordial wel come was extended to all who desired to avail themselves
        of its privileges. Various speakers from abroad visited Augusta and, under
        the auspices of the Ladies'' Christian Temperance Union and the Reform Club,
        addressed the cit izens. These meetings were well attended, and their influ
        ence felt to a very marked degree. The officers for the second year were Mrs.
        William Griffin, President ; Mrs. 0. G. Ashley, Secretary ; Mrs. T. W. Wood,
        Treasurer. LADIES'' LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. Through the untiring energy and perseverance
        of Mrs. A. M. North (president of the Ladies'' Literary Society), a Ladies''
        Library Association was established, in connection with the above society,
        on the 21st of February, 1877, known by the name of the " Ladies'' Library
        Association of Augusta." In a series of resolutions embodying the aims of
        this organization it was resolved that " the object of the association shall
        be the establishment and maintenance of a library, to afford useful and entertaining
        reading and the promotion of moral and intellectual improvement in the village
        of Augusta and its surroundings." The first offi cers elected were Mrs. C.
        W. Cock, President ; Mrs. C. S. Kent, Vice-President ; Miss M. Warmington,
        Secretary ; Mrs. C. E. Ives, Treasurer ; Miss L. H. Kendall, Librarian ; Members
        of the Board of Directors, Mrs. A. F. Tyndall, Mrs. H. D. Pool, Mrs. E. D.
        Town, Mrs. M. Hulett, Mrs. L. J. Brown. The ladies who enrolled themselves
        as its first members were For the third year Mrs. McElhany was chosen President,
        Mrs. Tyndall Secretary, and Mrs. T. C. Wood Treasurer. The present officers
        are Mrs. Nelson Eldred, President ; Mrs. John L. Clark, Secretary ; Mrs. William
        Griffin, Treasurer. LADIES'' LITERARY SOCIETY. A meeting was called at the
        house of Mrs. A. M. North, April 5, 1876, to effect the organization of a
        Ladies'' Cen tennial Literary Society. Many of the influential families of
        the village were represented, and much encouragement was given to the enterprise.
        From a membership of 14 ladies the following were selected as the first officers
        : Mrs. A. M. North, President ; Mrs. H. D. Pool, Vice-President ; Mrs. C.
        E. Ives, Secretary. A resolution was adopted indicating the purpose of the
        society to be that of mutual improvement, and suggesting the advisability
        of devoting the first centennial year to researches into American history.
        Wednesday afternoon, from three to five o''clock, of each week, was designated
        as the time for holding the meetings. From that time until the present the
        society has been ex ceedingly prosperous. With the exception of a few occa
        sions, when the excessive heat or the extreme cold has prevented, the meetings
        have been regularly held and well attended. Mrs. H. H. Van Anken, M. Hulett,
        E. D. Town, A. E. Hulett, A. M. North, C. W. Cock, L. Labar, H. D. Pool, E.

        ter, N. F. Pool, A. King, M. Gregory, Miss Mary Ogden, Miss Mary Warmington,
        Miss L. H. Kendall. At the organization of the library there were 148 volumes
        of readable matter presented to the society, nearly 100 of them having been
        donated by Mrs. A. M. North, and the remainder by other members of the association.
        The num ber has since been increased to 307 volumes. The readings were begun
        with the early history of the American continent, dating from the first records
        of dis covery, and followed through the early settlement to the struggle for
        independence, and ultimately to its present condition of prosperity. The early
        investigations on this interesting topic were especially thorough, involving
        the history of the Northmen, who explored the country prior to the discoveries
        of Columbus, and occupied, together with the history of the country which
        followed, a period of a year and a half. Later a very thorough research into
        Eng lish history was made, which was followed by Roman, Per sian, Egyptian,
        aud Chinese history. Innumerable miscel laneous articles of interest were
        also read. The association since its existence has raised, by enter tainments
        and in other ways, the sum of $235.65, all of which has been expended in works
        of the best authors, em bracing biography, history, and fiction. At the first
        annual meeting of the Library Association the following officers were elected
        : Mrs. C. S. Kent, President, who soon resigned in favor of Mrs. M. Hulett
        ; Mrs. E. D. Town, Vice-President; Miss M. Warmington, Secretary; Mrs. C.
        E. Ives, Treasurer ; MissL. H. Kendall, Librarian ; Board of Directors, Mrs.
        M. Gregory, Mrs. C. S. Kent, Mrs. H. D. Pool, Mrs. Mygatt, Mrs. A. F. Tyndall.

        \ and Sunday-school. Miss E. L Valentine, one of the original organizers,\
        \ has been librarian for fifteen years. The Sabbath-school (of which the North\
        \ Church is the outgrowth) was organized by 4 young ladies (members of the\
        \ First Presbyterian Sabbath school), viz., Misses Eliza L. Valentine, Helen\
        \ Reed, Bertha Hilbert, and Addie Haley, on the 5th day of June, 1864, in\
        \ the oak forest on the east side of Kalamazoo River, now known as the semi\
        \ nary grounds. Beneath those majestic oaks, on that beau tiful June day,\
        \ 12 scholars were gathered for the first time to hear God's word, and this\
        \ \" Mission in the Woods,\" or \" Mission Woods Sabbath-school,\" as it always\
        \ has been known, was organized, and continued in its forest home, managed\
        \ by the young ladies, until fall, when Mr. B. Mc- Cain became interested\
        \ in the work, and through his en deavors the old red school-house was secured\
        \ for their ses sions, and this school moved in the first Sabbath in October,\
        \ 1864. Mr. McCain remained superintendent of the school until April, 1865,\
        \ when Mr. Herbert Dennison, the assis tant superintendent, took the position,\
        \ and at the first an nual meeting,* in June, 1865, Mr. Frank S. Hillhouse\
        \ was elected superintendent, and he remained as such for five years, or until\
        \ June, 1870, when he resigned the position, positively declining to accept\
        \ it again. During his admin istration David Haines and Gilbert Wilson were\
        \ assistant superintendents, S. W. Faxon, Mary H. and Lucius L. Clark, secretaries.\
        \ Mr. Hillhouse entered upon this work, and gathered around him many valuable\
        \ helpers, and this school soon outgrew its quarters in the school-house,\
        \ and knew not where to go. The present outlook for the school and church\
        \ is very encouraging. It stands in a portion of Kalamazoo number ing several\
        \ thousands, and not an evangelical church but this one. The managers of the\
        \ Sunday-school had felt for several years .that stated preaching ought to\
        \ be sustained in North Kalamazoo, and in January, 1876, the experiment was\
        \ tried, and several of the students from the college preached during that\
        \ winter, demonstrating that a congregation could be gathered with proper\
        \ effort. Through the assist ance of the Ladies' Aid Society of the First\
        \ Presbyterian Church, who contributed $300 of the sum needed, the services\
        \ of Rev. E. B. Sherwood were secured in April, 1876, who spent a year on\
        \ the field, visiting from house to house, conducting evening meetings, and\
        \ preaching on the Sabbath ; he visited over 600 families in North Kalamazoo.\
        \ To his labors, in a great degree, is attributed the organi zation of the\
        \ North Church, although it was not organized until nearly a year after he\
        \ left. Mr. S. C. Irland, an evangelist from Chicago, succeeded Mr. Sherwood\
        \ for nine mouths, until January, 1878, and when he left it seemed as though\
        \ the effort to sustain preaching must be aban doned; but \"man's extremity\
        \ is God's opportunity,\" and while it seemed the darkest, the light was very\
        \ near to us. For the Lord sent us Rev. J. Anderson to preach a few Sabbaths,\
        \ and the way opened for a church to be organized and he was chosen its pastor,\
        \ and North Kalamazoo will long remember the labor of himself and his faithful\
        \ wife in advancing the kingdom of the Lord. Since the organiza tion of the\
        \ society, they have been enabled to build an ad dition to the chapel 24 by\

        \ an expense of $1800, aud are entirely out of debt. The congregations on\
        \ the Sabbath have increased, and the Sabbath-school is cramped for want of\
        \ room, having an average of nearly 200, with an enrollment of 400 aud over\
        \ at the present time. At this juncture the First Presbyterian Sabbath-school\
        \ voted to buy a lot and build a chapel, and L. H. Trask, W. A. Tomlinson,\
        \ and D 0. Roberts were appointed a com mittee for that purpose, and they\
        \ selected the lot corner of Burdick and Ransom Streets, and erected the chapel\
        \ now standing thereon, 60 by 28 feet, at a cost not far from $2000. The school\
        \ took possession the first Sabbath in August, 1866, and very soon doubled\
        \ its numbers, and has continued to occupy it until the present time. At the\
        \ annual meeting in June, 1870, Daniel O. Rob erts was elected superintendent\
        \ ; H. M. Warren, assistant ; Edward C. Parsons, secretary. During the administration\

        \ these disappointments made little or no impression on me. I went down, in\
        \ 1749, and lived two years with my brother at his country-house; for my mother\
        \ was now dead. I there composed the second part of my Essay, which I called\
        \ ' Political Discourses,' and also my ' Enquiry concerning the ' Principles\
        \ of Morals,' which is another part of my treatise, that I cast anew. Meanwhile,\
        \ my bookseller, A. Miller, informed me that my former publications (all but\
        \ the unfortunate Treatise) were beginning to be the subject of conversation;\
        \ and the sale of them was gradually increasing, and that new editions were\
        \ demanded. Answers by reverends, and right reverends, came out two or three\
        \ in a year ; and I found, by Dr. Warburton's railing, that the books were\
        \ beginning to be esteemed in good company. However, I had a fixed resolution,\
        \ which I inflexibly maintained, never to reply to anybody ; and not being\
        \ very irascible in my temper, I had easily kept myself clear of all literary\
        \ squabbles. These symptoms of a rising reputation gave me encouragement,\
        \ as I was ever more disposed to see the favourable than unfavourable side\
        \ of things ; a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess, than to be\
        \ born to an estate of 10,000/. a-year. In 1751, I removed from the country\
        \ to the town, the true scene for a man of letters. In 1752, were published\
        \ at Edinburgh, where I then lived, my ' Political Discourses,' the only work\
        \ of mine that was successful on the first publication. It was well received\
        \ abroad and at home. In the same year was published at London, my ' Enquiry\
        \ con cerning the Principles of Morals;' which, in my own opinion (who ought\
        \ not to judge on that subject), is of all my writings, historical, philosophical,\
        \ or literary, incomparably the best. It came unnoticed and unobserved into\
        \ the world. In 1752, the Faculty of Advocates chose me their librarian, an\
        \ office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the\
        \ command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the History\
        \ of England; but being frightened with the notion of continu ing a narrative\
        \ through a period of 1 700 years, I commenced with the accession of the House\
        \ of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the mis representation of faction began\
        \ chiefly to take place. I was, I own, sanguine in my expectations of the\
        \ success of this work. I thought that I was the only historian that had at\
        \ once neglected present power, interest, and authority, and the cry of popular\
        \ prejudices ; and as the subject was suited to every capacity, I expected\

        \ He was a member, during the rebellion, of the Third Ohio cavalry, enlisting\
        \ in 1861, and serving over two years. At this time he was compelled to leave\
        \ the service on account of ill health. He was captain of company A, of that\
        \ regiment. He was elected Clerk of the Courts of Guthrie county in 1864,\
        \ holding that office for four years. He also represented Guthrie county in\
        \ the Fourteenth General Assembly. Mr. M, together with their oldest son,\

        \ Maine, August 7, 1822, and is of English ancestry. At the age of sixteen\
        \ he moved with his parents to Buxton, where his time was mostly engaged in\
        \ turns at teaching and attending school until he attained his majority. Having\
        \ determined to make teaching a profession, he set out for that pur pose toward\
        \ the sunny South, but, as he says, he was \" born too far north,\" for his\
        \ political comfort. Suspicion having been raised as to his abolition ist\
        \ proclivities, and finding the elements not altogether congenial, he soon\
        \ abandoned the land of the palm and the palmetto, for the old Granite State,\
        \ where he engaged for several years in farming. In 1847, he moved to Tanworth,\
        \ New Hampshire, Avhere he embarked in the mercantile busi ness, in company\
        \ Avith a brother. In this, as in all his industrial enter prises, he was\
        \ quite successful. In 1854, he was elected to the New Hamp shire Legislature,\
        \ at the same time Gen. N. B. Baker was Gov ernor of the State. In 1855 he\
        \ was returned a second term to the Legislature. Not being satisfied Avith\
        \ the limited re sources of Northern New England, he determined to try his\
        \ fortune on the broad prairies of the new and more fertile West. Accordingly,\
        \ in 1856, he turned his face tOAvard the setting sun. He made a final settlement\
        \ at McGregor, Iowa, where he established a branch house of the old firm.\
        \ McGregor, was then a small village with a few scattering houses, and sur\
        \ rounded by a country with a sparse population. But immigration poured in\
        \ rapidly, and with increased population their trade increased until their\
        \ house became one of the most extensive establishments on the Upper Mis sissippi\
        \ river. This result wasoAving to his correct and energetic business qualities.\
        \ In Iowa he was equally fortunate in securing the good will of those who\
        \ knew him. His neighbors, and those who had dealings with him, found a man,\
        \ honest in business, fair in his dealings, social in his re lations, and\
        \ benevolent in his disposition. He took and active interest in the prosperity\
        \ of the town and ever held an open hand to all needed chari ties. These traits\
        \ of character had drawn around him, but not realized or intended by himself,\
        \ a host of personal admirers. This good will re sulted in his being nominated\
        \ for a seat in the State Legislature, and the only one elected on his ticket.\

        \ composed of some of the best minds in the State, and did more real, hard\
        \ service than any session held in Iowa before, or since that date. He continued\
        \ in business at McGregor until the sum mer of 1862, when he was commissioned\

        \ the first rail was laid in Iowa, at or near high water mark on the bank\
        \ of the Mississippi, in the city of Davenport. That year the road was completed\
        \ to Iowa City, a distance of about 54\xA3 miles. The first loco motive in\
        \ Iowa was landed at Davenport in July of the same year, and was called the\
        \ \"Antoine LeClaire.\" The road was then called the Mississippi & Missouri\
        \ Railroad. The first rail was laid at Keokuk, on what was then called the\
        \ Keokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota Railroad, on the 9th day of September,\
        \ 1856, and in October of the same year two locomotives for the road were\
        \ landed at Keokuk from a barge which arrived from Quincy. They were called\
        \ the \" Keokuk \" and the \"Des Moines.\" In the meantime several lines of\
        \ railroad had been projected to cross the State from points on the Mississippi.\
        \ On the 15th of May, 1756, an act of Congress was approved making a grant\
        \ of land to the State to aid in the construction of railroads from Burlington\
        \ to the Missouri river, near the mouth of Platte river; from Davenport, via\
        \ Iowa City and Fort Des Moines to Council Bluffs; from Lyons northeasterly\
        \ to a point of intersection with the main line of the Iowa Central Air Line\
        \ Railroad, near Maquoketa thence on said main line, running as near as practicable\
        \ on the forty-second parallel across the State to the Missouri river, and\
        \ from Dubuque to a point on the Missouri river at or near Sioux City. The\
        \ grant embraced the sections designated by odd numbers six miles in width\
        \ on each side of the four roads named. Where lands had been sold the State\
        \ was authorized to select other lands equal in quantity from alternate sections\
        \ or parts of sections within fifteen miles of the lines located. The law\
        \ provided certain conditions to be observed by the State in disposing of\
        \ the lands to the railroads for which they were granted. In consequence of\
        \ this grant the governor called a spe cial session of the General Assembly\
        \ which convened at Iowa City in July of that year, and on the 14th of the\
        \ same month an act was approved accepting the grant, and regranting the lands\
        \ to the railroads named, on certain speci fied conditions. The roads, with\
        \ the exception of the Iowa Central Air Line, accepted the several grants,\

        of different kinds, lectures, plays by home talent, etc. On the 22d of February
        each year the society has its annual dinner, which is an enjoyable feature.
        No officer receives any salary but the librarian. The association owns its
        building, and 1,256 volumes, embracing many of the standard works in all the
        departments of literature, and is out of debt. The shares of stock are now
        worth $30. Non-stockholders are charged $2 per annum for the use of the books.
        The present officers are : Mrs. W. H. Mann, president; Mrs. Fannie Potter,
        secretary and librarian ; George H. Potter, treasurer. The first school building
        was put up by Isaac Beyea, two blocks north of Wenger''s Block, in 1860. Previous
        to this, school was held in a building which stood north of where Harwood
        lives. The school house was 22x48, and was used until 1869, when it was moved
        to the center of town, and is occupied by S. V. West as a drug store. In 1869
        the main part of the present school-house was built. It is 35x75, two stories
        high. The west wing was built in 1879, 30x40, two stories. The school is graded
        to four departments, primary, sec ond primary, intermediate and senior, and
        is in charge of Mr. E. Bru maghin, a graduate of the Albany (New York) High

        \ ; is inclosed by a tight board fence eight feet high; the floral hall is\
        \ 24x100 feet. There is a large number of complete stables for all kinds of\
        \ stock, a never failing supply of artesian water, and a fine amphitheater\
        \ which will comfortably seat 500 persons. The track is a half mile in length,\

        \ ; D. Ward, treasurer. The settlers who came to this neighborhood after the\
        \ railroad was completed felt the need of the organization of a small fruit\
        \ and hor- ticultural society, in which could be discussed the various kinds\
        \ of pursuits in which they were engaged. About the time of the war a farmers'\
        \ club was organized, composed of the leading farmers in the township, and\
        \ meetings were held as often as circumstances would permit. During the war\
        \ these meetings were abandoned ; other things took the attention of the people\
        \ who had a country to save and had sent sons to save it. After the war the\
        \ meetings were re- sumed by such men as E. G. Babcock, F. P. Beach, H. Pinney,\
        \ R. B. Pangborn, S. H. Harper, J. B. Clark, I. W. Wilson and many others.\
        \ In February, 1866, the name was changed to Farmers' Club and Fruit Growers'\
        \ Association, and in May, 1867, again changed to Onarga Horticultural Society.\
        \ In December John B. Clark was elected president ; H. Pinney, vice-president\
        \ ; E. C. Hall, secretary and librarian ; and Dr. L. Pike, treasurer. In the\
        \ spring of 1868 the State Horticultural Convention held a session here. M.\
        \ L. Dunlapy of Champaign, Dr. Warder, of Ohio, and other celebrated horticul-\
        \ turists lectured from time to time before this society. It was for many\
        \ years considered one of the leading organizations of the kind in the state.\
        \ Regular meetings were held till 1878, and occasionally since then. The soil\
        \ in the neighborhood is well adapted to small fruit, and this industry has\
        \ been one of considerable magnitude. It was commenced by E. Gould, who first\
        \ made a success in strawberries, soon followed by many others, till for several\
        \ years there were nearly 100 acres in strawberries, and a number of acres\
        \ set to raspberries and other small fruits. Some years more than a hundred\
        \ tons of grapes are raised in the corporation. One year the sales of small\
        \ fruit amounted to over $30,000, and the culture employed a large number\
        \ of laborers. In the last few years, on account of the low price of fruit,\
        \ many have abandoned the business. December 3, 1864, there was organized\

        which Hawthorne, Curtis and Greeley were leading members. The Ohio Phalanx
        was com posed of young and ardent admirers of Fourier, the socialist. There
        was no free love, but the members lived in a village, dined at common tables,
        dwelt in separate cottages, and worked in the community fields together and
        allowed the proceeds of all their earnings to go into a common fund. 3Ianufactor
        ies were established, the soil was fertile, and pros perity would have followed
        had all the members been honest and the climate healthful. Fever and ague
        ran riot with the weeds, and the most ignor ant and avaricious of the Arcadian
        band began to absorb what really belonged to the weaker ones, who did most
        of the hard labor. 3Ir. 3Ieeker, who was one of the chief workers, was glad
        to get away alive with his wife and two boys, the youngest of whom was born
        shaking with the ague. 3Ir. 3Ieeker was the librarian and chief literary authority
        of the community, but he lost most of his books, and when he reached his Cleveland
        home he had but a few dollars. In company with his brothers, he opened a small
        store and ''began business on a 1 worldly'' basis ; and he prospered so that
        he was invited to join another community, the disciples and followers of Alexander
        Campbell, a Scotch- Irishman, the founder of the religious sect the members
        of which are sometimes called '' Carnp b.''llites.'' Gen. Garfield is a follower
        of this faith, and he became a fellow-townsman of 3Ir. 3Ieeker. The ''disciples''
        were building a large college at Hiram, Ohio, and 3Ir. 3Ieeker moved his store
        thither and received the patronage of the school and church. While there,
        he wrote a book called '' The Adventures of Captain Armstrong.'' mas Ward,
        and the result was a warm personal friendship. When the war broke out, he
        wrote a letter to the Tribune on the Southwestern political leaders and the
        resources of the Mississippi Val ley. Horace Greeley telegraphed to A. D.
        Rich ardson, who was in charge ofthe Tribune at Cairo, this dispatch : " ''
        Meeker is the man we-want.'' Sidney How ard Gay engaged him, and, after serving
        as a war correspondent at Fort Donelson and other places, at the close of
        the war, 3Ir. 3Ieeker was called to New York to take charge of the agricultural
        de partment and do general editorial work on the Tribune. He wrote a book
        entitled " Life in the West," and his articles on the Oneida Community were
        copied into leading German, French and other European journals. In 1869, he
        was sent to write up the 3Iormons ; but finding the roads be yond Cheyenne
        blockaded with snow, he turned southward and followed the Rocky 3Iountains
        down to the foot of Pike''s Peak, where he was so charmed with the Garden
        of the Gods and the un surpassed scenery of that lovely region, where birds
        were singing and grasses growing in the mountains, that he said, if he could
        persuade a dozen families to go thither, he would take his wife and girls
        to live and die there. 3Ir. Greeley was dining at the Delmonico when he heard
        of it. " '' Tell 3Ieeker," exclaimed he, '' to go ahead. I will back him with
        the Tribune.'' " A letter was printed, a meeting held, subscrip tions invited,
        and $96,000 were forwarded to the Treasurer immediately. 31r. 3Ieeker was
        elected President of the colony, and Horace Greeley made Treasurer. So many
        applications were sent in that it was thought a larger tract of land would
        be needed than seemed to be free from incumbrance at Pike''s Peak. Several
        miles square of land were bought on the Cache-la-Poudre River, where the town
        of Greeley now stands, and several hundred families were established in what
        had been styled '' The Great American Desert.'' Horace Greeley''s one exhortation
        was : " In 1856, when the great panic came, he lost nearly everything. Then
        he moved to Southern Illinois, and, with the remnant of his goods, opened
        a small store near Dongola, in Union County. For several years his boys ''ran''
        the store, while he worked a small farm and devoted his spare hours to literature.

        the vacancy, and Luther H. Wolcott . to be Assistant Superintendent. A new
        library and Sunday7 school papers had just been procured by Samuel Cushman,
        of Denver. The school at that time numbered about one hundred members, and
        it was no unusual thing that the number of verses committed to memory from
        the Bible, and recited at a session of the school, would be over five hundred.
        '' At a picnic of the school July 2, 1863, held at a bower well fitted up
        and prepared for the oc- casion, in Quartz Valley, near Central, over two
        hundred children and as many adults were present to enjoy themselves generally,
        and par- take of refreshments upon the well-spread tables, and to listen to
        addresses from Revs. Messrs. Warner and Crawford and others pres- sent. Later,
        Mr. Warner had returned to the East and the school had appointed Rev. William
        Crawford its Superintendent. Later still, the school had been merged into
        the different religious denorninations that had been organized in and about
        Central City. We have been thus particular in the history7 of this Union Sabbath
        School, and in its con- nection with the early " Union Church com- posed of
        the members of the various evangel- ical denominations," first organized in
        Gilpin County, that others may compare, if they will, the present with the
        past usefulness of both churches and Sabbath schools in their Master''s kingdom
        here, especially in view of the expense and labor required in sustaining them.
        We do not expect, to maintain the old maxim that in " union there is strength,"
        as against the sophistry of theologians, that in diversity of effort in the

        could not keep her baby from crying ; when some one in the audience called
        out, " Let the baby7 cry ; it reminds us of home." She then sat down again
        somewhat comforted, whether the baby7 was or not ! But October 27, 1861, the
        Central City Union Sabbath School commenced a regular organiza- tion. January
        5, 1862, a constitution and by- laws had been printed for them by the Rocky
        Mountain News, and was then formally adopted, of which the following is the
        PREAMBLE : Whereas, We, citizens of Central City (and vicin- ity), Gilpin
        County, Colorado Territory, firmly believ- ing that, to establish upon a permanent
        basis, and sustain in a prosperous condition, a union Sabbalh school, to which
        candid Bible students, of whatever creed, craft or profession, are admitted
        with an equal and cordial welcome, is one of the best means of pro- moting
        the public good ; and further, believing that such a school can, and ought
        to be, established and sus- tained in this place, and that, to secure the
        correct and harmonious action of its official members, a system of rules and
        regulations for its government are required ; therefore, we, a body of teachers,
        adopt the following constitution and bv-laws : The following officers were

        The pro ceedings were verified before Hiram Roosa, notary public, and recorded
        April 7, 1870. This society immediately erected a house of worship, completing
        it in the fall of 1870, when Rev. Mr. Stutz, of Washington, was called, and
        accepted the pastorate. The first officers of the church were : Elders, Edward
        B. Houghtaling, Charles Taylor ; Deacons, Henry H. Rey nolds, Francis S. Wynkoop,
        Jr. These were installed by Rev. C. Van Dyke, on the date of organization.

        and such other Protestant religious services as may be deemed suitable for
        moral and religious improvement at the above place." The certificate was verified
        before How ard Cockburn, notary public, and recorded April 29, 1871. This
        enterprise, thus placed on a legal basis, has been a Avork of great value.
        The citizens mentioned above and many others have given to it much generous
        aid and self-sacrifi cing endeavor. It has secured religious instruction to
        a large number of children and youth, and has contributed its full share to

        corner of Wall and Main Streets, which originally, and many years before,
        had been constructed for and used as a church by the Dutch Reformed congregation,
        which afterwards had been devoted to various purposes, such as lectures and
        en tertainments, and which had been purchased by New York State about the
        beginning of the civil Avar, to be used as a drill-room and armory, was finally
        purchased by a few Catholic gentlemen for the sum of $900(1. The names of
        these were Michael Hallahan, Danie''l E. Donovan, James A. Booth, and Luke
        Noone. The following year, and on their application, a priest, Rev. James
        Dougherty, a native of Rondout, and ordained a few months previous, was tip
        pointed by Archbishop McCloskey to take charge of this building, and to form
        at once a congregation. Immediate steps were taken to put the building in
        repair for Divine service. The gentlemen mentioned above had already col lected
        from all classes, Protestant as well as Catholic, the large sum of 84000.
        In October, 1868, the work was begun ; a new front replaced the old ; the
        building was added to in the rear ; stained-glass windows put in ; newly plastered
        and frescoed, so that at its dedication iu July, 1869, by the archbishop,
        it was one of the handsomest Catholic churches between New York and Albany.

        Jr., Secretary ; Wesley D. Hale, Librarian ; Avith 10 teachers and about 75
        scholars. There have been regular sessions of the school winter and summer
        up to the present time. There has also been held a weekly class-meeting, and
        a weekly prayer-meeting has also been sustained. The present officers of the
        school are D. B. Stow, Superintendent ; A. E Van Gaasbeck, Treasurer; Charles
        H. Van Gaasbeck, Librarian ; Miss Mary Campbell, Secretary. There are 8 teachers,
        and an average attendance of 50 scholars. The school has a library of 200
        volumes, a cabinet organ, and all the appliances for efficient work. Though
        meeting with many difficulties, and not realizing all of the success hoped
        for, yet by patient toil it is believed some good has been done. In 1875 a
        handsome rectory was built in the rear of the church, and this, together with
        a school-house, corner of Fair and Bowery Streets, where 200 children receive

        \ Hall is in quite a different location, on Clinton Avenue, near Al bany.\

        \ PUBLIC BUILDINGS. Among those not already mentioned under other heads, the\
        \ City Hall is a prominent feature. It is eligibly situ ated, on high ground,\
        \ in tbe vicinity of the modern \"Wilt wyck,\" as it was called for a few\
        \ years before the formation of the city government. The City Hall thus occupies\
        \ a central position on Union Avenue, easily accessible from all parts of\
        \ the city. It is a fine brick building, erected the year after the organization\
        \ of the city, affording ample rooms for the various city offices, and for\
        \ the Supreme Court cham bers, the latter of which include the excellent library\
        \ estab lished by the State in this judicial district. The library consists\
        \ of about 3000 volumes, and has been in charge since it was founded, in 1874,\
        \ of Wallace H. Smith, Librarian. The building cost $75,000, and occasioned\
        \ much criticism by the taxpayers, yet it is a fine specimen of architecture,\
        \ well adapted to the wants of the city, and really needed for its various\
        \ offices, reference being had not only to the present, but the future. The\
        \ grounds in front are hand somely graded ; considerable rock remains to be\
        \ removed on the west side, and more grading to be done, to bring the entire\
        \ grounds into a condition adapted to so fine a public building. CITY TELEGRAPH.\
        \ This was an enterprise of the Winter Brothers, and has been in active operation\
        \ nearly twenty years, forming a rapid line of communication with all parts\
        \ of the city. It is, however, being almost entirely superseded by the telephonic\
        \ lines now opened, so that, as far as special city telegraphic lines are\
        \ concerned, they are of the past, and have no place in this chapter. CITY\

        \ do a general package busi ness, and handle considerable freight. Their telephone\
        \ connections are rendering communication, with reference to the express business,\
        \ very prompt and certain. KINGSTON POST-OFFICE. NEW YOBK STATE ABMORY. Kingston\
        \ was a post-town undoubtedly before the Revo lution. But of the colonial\
        \ arrangements, or even of those immediately following the Revolution, we\
        \ have little or no account. At the present time Kingston belongs to the second\
        \ class of offices in the divisions recognized by the postmaster-general.\
        \ The building uoav occupied was com menced in 1868 and completed in 1869.\
        \ Nearly all the mails are carried by the railroads. The mail-routes still\
        \ provided for, as in old times, are only three, \u2014 Kingston to Ellenville,\
        \ Kingston to Rifton, Kingston to Esopus. Kingston is a money-order office,\
        \ both domestic and for eign, the latter including Canada, Great Britain,\
        \ Germany, and Switzerland. Another handsome edifice is the armory, erected\
        \ by the State in the city of Kingston. The expense of maintain ing it, keeping\
        \ it in order, and lighting is to be borne by the local authorities. The securing\
        \ of this expenditure by the State in this city is largely due to the efforts\
        \ of Lieut.- Col. Tremper after he took command of the Twentieth Bat talion,\
        \ aided by the members of the Legislature from this county. Col. Tremper called\
        \ the attention of the Board of Supervisors to the matter, being well satisfied\
        \ that it would be impossible to maintain a good degree of efficiency in the\
        \ command without a convenient drill-room and furnished headquarters. The\
        \ supervisors declining to undertake the expense in these times of other heavy\
        \ taxation, application was made to the' Legislature, and at the session of\
        \ 1878 an appropriation of $15,000 was made for the object desired. The commissioners\
        \ of the State, consisting of Adj. -Gen. Townsend, Insp.-Gen. Woodward, and\
        \ Com. -Gen. Wylie, were placed in charge of the matter. Much credit is given\
        \ to assemblyman Searing for his ability in \" grasping the situation\" and\
        \ securing favorable action at Albany upon this appropriation. The sum was\
        \ not deemed sufficient to erect a building of the proper dimensions and substantial\
        \ character required, and upon application the Legislature granted $10,000\
        \ more at the session of 1879. The build ing was then put under contract,\
        \ and completed the follow ing summer and fall. The contractor was Henry W.\
        \ Otis, of Kingston ; the architect, John A. Wood, of New York. Lieut.-Col.\
        \ Tremper had taken command of the battalion July 23, 1877, and on the 19th\
        \ of February, 1880, he had the pleasure of taking charge of this new armory\
        \ by order of the State authorities. The building is located upon Union Avenue,\
        \ a short distance from the City Half. Its The \" Co-operative Mail and Passenger\
        \ Company,\" in this county, carry the mail over the following routes : No.\
        \ 6190, Rondout to Rifton Glen, six round trips per week ; No. 6191, Rondout\
        \ to Ellenville, six round trips per week; No. 6198, Saugerties to Palenville,\
        \ six round trips; 6199, Saugerties to Glasco, six round trips per week ;\
        \ 6200, Sau gerties to Hunter, one round trip per week. The route to Ellenville\
        \ is owned by a sub-contractor, residing there. Postmasters.\u2014 In the\
        \ early part of this century Conradt Elmendorf was postmaster for many years,\
        \ and was suc ceeded by William Cockburn, who was followed by the several\
        \ successive incumbents named below: Jacob K. Trumpbour, 1829-39; Benjamin\
        \ M. Hasbrouck, 1839 41 ; William Culley, 1841-45; Isaac Van Buren, 1845 48;\
        \ Daniel Young, 1848-49; William H. Romeyn, 1849 -53; William Kerr, 1853-61;\
        \ Caleb S. Clay, 1861-69; Joseph S. Smith, 1869-73 ; Daniel Bradbury, 1873\

        " Wesleyan Chapel." This school prospered so finely that it encouraged the
        parties who favored the enterprise. The number of scholars present at the
        organization was 60, and enough persons. offered themselves as teachers to
        supply the school. At the first meeting of the teachers the following officers
        were elected, viz., Male Superintendent, AndreAv E. Schep moes ; Assistant
        Superintendent, John H. Howland ; Fe male Superintendent, Caroline Schaffer
        ; Female Assistant, Sarah Hollister ; Secretary, James Beyea ; Librarian,
        Hy man F. Styles ; Treasurer, Cornelius I. Houghtaling. The school needed
        books for its use, and the pastor applied to the Sunday-School Union of the
        Methodist Episcopal Church. This was successful, and a grant of books amounting
        to $10 was made to it. The school prospered so much beyond the expectation
        of its friends, and the number increased so, that a further supply of books
        was necessary. To meet this necessity a strawberry festival was held on the
        evening of July 4th of the same year. This resulted in clearing about $50,
        which added greatly to the efficiency of the school. ing. The number of trustees
        was afterwards increased to nine. At a joint meeting of the committee and
        trustees, on the 23d of October, it was resolved that the name and title of
        this organization shall be the " Second Methodist Episcopal Church of Kingston."
        This title was changed a few years ago, by order of court, to that of " Clinton
        Avenue Metho dist Episcopal Church of Kingston." The membership at the organization
        numbered about 30, but it rapidly increased, and by accessions from time to
        time it now numbers about 350. The first class-leaders were Andrew E. Schepmoes
        and William W. Smith. C I. Houghtaling was appointed a leader a few months
        after the organization. The first stewards were William Beatty, Cornelius
        I. Houghtaling, and Daniel V. Lamoree. The society worshiped in the " chapel"
        until the latter part of the year 1858, when the present building was so far
        completed that the basement was occupied for worship, and on the 19th of January,
        1859, the audience-room was dedicated. Rev. J. B. Wakeley, D.D., conducted
        the dedi catory services. Rev. A. M. Osbon, D.D., and Rev. S. D. Brown, D.D.,
        assisted in the services, and during the day and evening both preached. On
        Sunday, the 22d day of July, 1855, the first sermon was preached in connection
        with this movement. The ser vice was conducted by Rev. R. A. Chalker, who
        preached the sermon. In the fall of the year 1878 the interior of the audience
        room was remodeled and greatly improved, and the walls very handsomely frescoed.
        This Avas mainly done by the energy and management of Rev. John Johns, who
        was the pastor at that time. The cost of the church and parsonage was about
        $15,000. In view of these encouragements, the official board of St. James''
        Church authorized the employment of a young man to labor in this new field.
        The presiding elder of Newburgh district, Rev. L. M. Vincent, appointed Rev.
        E. L. Prentice for this purpose. He began his labors in the latter part of
        August in the same year. The list of pastors is as follows, in the order of
        their appointment and the date: 1855, Erastus L. Prentice; 1857, Wm. H. Evenens
        ; 1859, William C. Smith; 1861, William G. Browning. In this year Rev. Benjamin
        Griffin was appointed by the bishop, but he was taken siek at the close of
        the Conference and died in a few weeks, and never served the church as pastor,
        and the presiding elder ap pointed Rev. Mr. Browning to the vacancy. In 1863,

        15th day of September of that year, the Quarterly Conference of St. James''
        Church appointed eight persons, together with the committee mentioned before
        (making eleven), to take into consideration the expediency of organ izing
        a second Methodist Episcopal Church in Kingston, to raise funds to forward
        the object, and to give advice in re lation to the matter. The committee then
        consisted of the following persons, viz., William W. Smith, Cornelius I. Houghtaling,
        William H. Whittaker, Edward O''Niel, Thomas Scott, John D. L. Montanye, William
        Beatty, Isaiah Stoutenbergh, Andrew E. Schepmoes, Whiting Weeks, and William
        S. Teller. This committee met at the parsonage of St. James'' Church on the
        24th of September. After organizing, by appointing Rev. R. A. Chalker chairman
        and A. E. Schep moes secretary, the following resolution was passed unani
        mously : "Resolved, That we deem it expodient to organize a Second Metho dist
        Episcopal Church in the southeast part of the village of Kingston immediately."
        The Sunday-school has been very prosperous. It now numbers 33 teachers and
        officers and 248 scholars, a total of 281. The present Sunday-school officers
        are: Superin tendent, J. Watson Wheeler ; Assistant, Barney McBride ; Secretary,
        Charles Driver; Librarian, Millard F. Van Gaas beck ; Assistant, Albeit Shultis
        ; Treasurer, Frank M. Nestel; Female Superintendent, Mrs. Julia McBride; As
        sistant, Mrs. Rev. John Johns. After further deliberation the following was
        also passed : "Resolved, That the pastor be requested to call a meeting of
        tho male members of the congregation, in accordance with the statutes in such
        cases made and provided, for the purpose of electing five trustees lo serve
        said church as soon as practicable." In accordance with this resolution a
        meeting was held on the 17th of October, and the following persons were elected
        trustees, viz.: William Beatty, Edgar B. Newkirk, Isaiah Stoutenbergh, James

        \ curves downward to the north east corner of the Grassmarket, embracing in\

        \ south side, where stands the massive pile, covered in many parts with rich\
        \ carving, named the India Buildings, in the old Scottish baronial style,\
        \ of unique construction, consisting of numerous offices, entered from a series\
        \ of circular galleries, and erected in 1867-8, containing the Scottish Chamber\
        \ of Agriculture, which was instituted in November, 1864. Its objects are\
        \ to watch over the interests of practical agriculture, to promote the advance\
        \ ment of that science by the discussion of all sub jects relating to it,\
        \ and to consider questions that may be introduced into Parliament connected\
        \ with it. The business of the Chamber is managed by a president, vice-president,\

        \ meetings at Perth in autumn, and at Edinburgh in November, annually ; and\
        \ all meetings are open to the press. The library is divided into thirteen\
        \ sections : \u2014 1, Arts and Sciences ; 2, Geography and Statistics ; 3,\

        \ \" To procure an exten sive collection of books on the general literature\
        \ of the country, including the most popular works on science.\" Thus every\
        \ department of British literature is amply represented on its shelves, and\
        \ at a charge so moderate as to be within the reach of all classes of the\
        \ community : the entry-money being only 2S. 6d., and the quarterly payments\
        \ is. 6d. The management of this library has always been vested in its own\
        \ members, and few societies ad here so rigidly to their original design as\
        \ the Mechanics' Library has done. It has, from the first, adapted itself\
        \ to the pecuniary circumstances of the working man, and from the commencement\
        \ it has been a self-supporting institution ; though in its infancy its prosperity\
        \ was greatly accelerated as its records attest, by liberal donations of works\
        \ in almost every class of literature. Among the earliest contributors in\
        \ this generous spirit, besides many of its own members, were Sir James Hall,\
        \ Bart., of Dunglas, so eminent for his attainments in geological and chemical\
        \ science ; his son, Captain Basil Hall, R.N., the well-known author; Mr.\
        \ Leonard Homer; and the leading publishers of the day \u2014 Messrs. Archibald\
        \ Constable, William Blackwood, Adam Black, Waugh and Innes, with John Murray\
        \ of London. Some of them were munificent in their gifts, \"besides granting\
        \ credit to any amount required \u2014 an accommodation of vital service to\
        \ an infant institution.\" In the centre of the southern part of the street\
        \ is St. John's Established church, built in 1838, in a mixed style of architecture,\
        \ with a Saxon door- way. It is faced on the north side by a handsome terrace,\
        \ portions of which rise from an open arcade, and include a Primitive Methodist\
        \ church, or Ebenezer chapel, and an Original Secession church. Victoria Terrace\
        \ is crossed at its western end by a flight of steps, which seem to continue\
        \ the old line of access afforded by the Upper West Bow. No. 5 Victoria Terrace\
        \ gives access to one of the most valuable institutions in the city \u2014\
        \ the Edinburgh Mechanics' Subscription Library. It was established in 1825,\

        \ visiting the gaudy and brilliant stores of such a shop as I have just described\
        \ (referring to Messrs. Manners and Miller). Mr. Laing him self is a quiet,\
        \ sedate looking old gentleman, who, although he has contrived to make very\
        \ rich in his business, has still the air of being somewhat dissatisfied that\
        \ so much more attention should be paid by his fellow-citizens to the flimsy\
        \ novelties of the day than to the solid and substantial articles which his\
        \ magazine displays. But his son is the chief enthusiast \u2014 indeed, he\
        \ is by far the most genuine specimen of the true old-fashioned biblio pole\
        \ that I ever saw exhibited in the person of a young man. My friend Wastle\
        \ (Lockhart) has a prodigious liking for him. Here Wastle commonly spends\
        \ one or two hours every week he is in Edin burgh, turning over, in the company\
        \ of his young friend, all the Aldines, Elzevirs, Wynkin de Wordes, and Caxtons,\
        \ in the collection, nor does he often leave the shop without taking some\
        \ little specimen of its treasures home with him. David Laing is still a very\
        \ young man, but Wastle tells me that he possesses a truly remarkable degree\
        \ of skill and knowledge in almost all departments of bibliography. Since\
        \ Lunn's death, he says, he does not think there is any of the booksellers\
        \ in London superior to him in this way. He publishes a catalogue almost every\
        \ year, and thus carries on a very extensive trade with all parts of the island.\
        \ I believe he has no rival in the whole country. This old gentleman and his\
        \ son are distinguished by their classical taste in regard to other things\
        \ besides books. They give an annual dinner to Wastle, and he carried me with\
        \ him the other day to one of these anniversaries. I have seldom seen a more\
        \ luxurious display. David and Wastle en tertained us with a variety of stories\
        \ about George Buchanan, the admirable Crichton, and all the more forgotten\
        \ heroes of the Delici\u0153 Poetarum Scotorum.\" The continuation of it,\

        \ long, useful, and studious career, and the mere enumeration of whose contributions\
        \ to Scottish history, antiquities, and literature, would form a long catalogue.\
        \ In No. 49 he was long in partnership with his father (whose shop had formerly\
        \ been at the Canongate-head, near St. Mary's Wynd), under the designation\
        \ of \"William and David Laing,\" in 1826; but long before that period he\
        \ had become known to the frequenters of the shop as a young man possessing\
        \ an immense amount of bibliographic information. John Gibson Lockhart gives\
        \ us a descriptive account of the Laings' establishment, which no doubt was\
        \ a pleasant lounge for him and other literati of the day. In \" Peter's Letters\
        \ to his Kinsfolk \" he writes thus :\u2014 \" As for shops of old books,\
        \ classics, black letter, foreign literature, and the like, I never was in\
        \ a great town which possesses so few of them as this. There is, however,\
        \ one shop of this sort which might cut a very respectable figure, even in\
        \ places where attainments are more in request. It is situated, as it ought\
        \ to be, in the immediate vicinity of the College, and consequently quite\
        \ out of the way of all fashionable promenades and lounges ; but, indeed,\
        \ for anything that I have seen, it is not frequented much by young gentlemen\
        \ of the Uni versity. The daily visitors of Mr. Laing seem rather to be a\
        \ few scattered individuals of various classes and professions, among whom,\
        \ in spite of the prevailing spirit and customs of the place, some love of\
        \ classical learning is still found to linger \u2014 retired clergymen and\
        \ the like, who make no great noise in the world, and, indeed, are scarcely\
        \ known to exist by the most part, even by the literary people of Edinburgh.\
        \ The shop, notwithstanding, is a remarkably neat and comfortable one, and\
        \ even a lady might lounge in it without having her eye offended or her gown\
        \ soiled. It consists of two apartments, which are both completely furnished\
        \ with valuable editions of old authors ; and I assure William Laing was the\
        \ first Edinburgh book seller who introduced Continental works to any extent\
        \ into the country, and he broke up a trade ring which then existed in Holland.\

        \ Scott; and when, in 1823, the Bannatyne Club (on the model of the Roxburghe)\
        \ started, he was made secretary, and speedily raised its members from thirty-one\
        \ to one hundred. Over thirty-eight years he worked in the literary interests\
        \ of the club, and was the intimate friend of Scott, Thomas Thomson, Lord\

        \ at midnight of the ancient school in the Blackfriars Gardens, and declining\
        \ to admit the masters or any one else, made preparation to stand a siege,\
        \ setting all authority at defiance. Mr. Bridges married Flora Macdonald of\

        \ and of their skill in the working thereof. By a charter of James VI., all\
        \ persons not of the corpo ration are prohibited from exercising the trade\
        \ of a goldsmith within the liberties of Edinburgh. Number 4 in this small\

        \ the old hall of the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, which was formed in 1681.\
        \ But long previous to that year the merchants of the city formed themselves\
        \ into a corporation, called the guildry, from which, for many ages, the magistrates\
        \ were exclusively chosen ; and, by an Act of Parliament passed in the reign\
        \ of James III., each of the incorporated trades in Edinburgh was empowered\
        \ to choose one of their number to vote in the election of those who were\
        \ to govern the city, and this guildry was the parent of the Merchant Company.\

        \ preserved, is described as an uncut sapphire; set in a ring, it is kept\
        \ as an heirloom in the family. The prophecy about the King's Crag is said\

        \ which was a col- legiate one, standing a few hundred yards north of the\
        \ Castle, was built in 1508 by Sir John Drum- mond, who, seventeen years before,\
        \ had erected Drummond Castle. Inside of the church he con- structed a vault\
        \ for the dust of his family in all time coming. Among the sleepers in it\
        \ is the late Baroness Perth, with a monument to her memory. Allan of Muidart,\
        \ the Chief of Clanranald, who fell at Sheriffmuir, was honoured with a place\
        \ in this sepulchre of nobility. The Strathallan family, a collateral branch\
        \ of the noble House of Drummond, likewise have their family vault here. Outside\
        \ of the church was the Churchyard, in which certain parties have still a\
        \ right to lay their dead. The school anil library of Innerpeffray, from which\
        \ the district derives much benefit, are not so old by nearly two centuries\
        \ as the Castle and the Church. \" The library, which contains about 2500\
        \ volumes, consisting chiefly of historical works of the sixteenth and seventeenth\
        \ centuries, some theological writ- ings, the more esteemed classics, and\
        \ the statutes of the realm, including a goodly number of black-letter volumes\
        \ cruelly cut to the quick in theprocess of bind- ingwas, in the year 1691,\
        \ bequeathed by David, Lord Madderty, for the use of ' young students.' He\
        \ also bequeathed funds for the construction of a library room and of a schoolroom,\
        \ and forthe endowment of a schoolmaster and remuneration of a librarian.\
        \ The entire sum granted for these purposes was 5000 merks {\xA3277 los 8^d\
        \ sterling). For a very long period \u2014 certainly from 1779 down till very\
        \ recently \u2014 the management of this mortification was most unsatis- factory.\
        \ It owes its present system of management to the late Hon. Robert Drummond\
        \ of Innerpeffray, who did not forget to record, in a solemn instru- ment,\
        \ penned within reach of Eussian guns \u2014 its claims \u2014 as a trust\
        \ on which his heart had set high hopes \u2014 even when engaged in the trying\
        \ duty of the trenches at Balaklava. The school is now being efficiently taught.\
        \ Since 1844 the library has been open to the public in general, instead of,\
        \ as formerly, to those students only who had matriculated at a University.\
        \ Since then upwards of 300 new works have been added to the library, which\
        \ contains a few volumes of great interest ; among others, Lady Madderty 's\
        \ Bible of 1637 ; a small French Bible of 1632, which belonged to her brother,\
        \ the great Marquis of Montrose, and bears his autograph ; an English Bible,\
        \ in black letter, of 1539.\" Monzie is now the property of Mr Johnston of\
        \ Lathrisk and Kilwhis, who lately acquired it by purchase. But it was long\
        \ in the possession of the Campbells, a branch of the noble house of Breadal\
        \ bane. The ancestor of the Campbells of Monzie was Archibald, fifth son of\
        \ Sir Duncan Campbe 1 \u2014 created first Baronet of Glenurchy in 1625 \u2014\
        \ by his wife, I-ady Jean Stewart, second daughter of John, Earl of Athole.\
        \ Several of his descendants make a considerable figure in our annals, both\
        \ military and civil. Alexander Campbell of Monzie served his country both\
        \ in the senate and in the camp ; and rose to the rank of Lieutenant-General\
        \ in the army. His son, also Alexander, the last male of the family that possessed\
        \ Monzie, represented Argyleshire in Parliament from 1841 to 1843, with which\
        \ shire he was connected as proprietor of Inverawe. Innerpeffray is in the\

        \ The present trustees have taken an interest in the duties assigned them,\
        \ and have made several useful improvements on the institution. The books\

        \ at the expense of one shilling, and books are circulated on the annual pay\
        \ ment of five shillings. Yet still it is to be regretted, either that the\
        \ public are not thoroughly alive to the value of the boon offered to them,\
        \ or that arrangements have not been made for the regular purchase of new\
        \ works and popular publications, so as to induce the public to avail themselves\
        \ of this rich repository of learning. The funds at present only suffice to\

        \ librarian a paltry pittance for his labours.\" where his brother William,\
        \ after his occupation was gone in Scotland, was made bishop of Vaison ; and\
        \ John was secret agent of the King of Spain and the Duke of Parma in their\
        \ correspondence with the Scottish Popish Lords. Sir James, fifth Chisholm\
        \ laird of Cromlix, though Master of the Household to James VI., and a great\
        \ favourite with him, was also an active and zealous member of the same fac\
        \ tion. It was meant that he should proceed to Spain to advance their designs\
        \ ; but, happily for himself, he was not ready in time. George Kerr went in\
        \ his stead ; was apprehended in one of the Cumbraes ; and letters found on\
        \ him led to the discovery of the plot known by the name of the \" Spanish\
        \ Blanks.\" In 1593, Sir James Chisholm was excommunicated by the Synod of\
        \ Fife, for his complicity \" in sundrie treasonable matters against the true\
        \ rehgion.\" In 1595, he appeared before the General Assembly whicli met at\
        \ Montrose, and, confessing the apostacy of which he had been guilty, and\
        \ declaring his adherence to the Reformed faith, he was admitted a member\
        \ of the Reformed Church. He had two sons, James and John, who both succeeded\
        \ him in Cromlix, but died without issue ; and on the death of John, the estate\
        \ passed to a branch of the noble House of Drummond, which retains it to this\
        \ day ; the present representative of the branch being the Honourable Captain\
        \ A. Drummond. We reserved, till we should come to Cromlix, the romantic story\
        \ of \"Fair Helen of Ardoch,\" the beautiful and lovely daughter of William\
        \ Stirling, brother of the laird of Ardoch. She and Sir James Chisholm, the\
        \ fifth of Cromlix, were much together in their childhood ; loved one another\
        \ in their teens ; and pledged their troth to take one another as husband\
        \ and wife, as soon as circumstances would permit their union. To complete\
        \ his education, or for some other purpose, the young knight was in the meantime\
        \ sent for years to France. Before leaviag, he arranged for a regular correspondence\
        \ with his love, without which even the temporary separation would have been\
        \ intolerable to them. A friend, a young gentleman in the district, was, for\
        \ certain prudential reasons, to receive the letters of both, which were to\
        \ be inclosed to him, and was to for ward them to their respective destinations.\
        \ The arrangement wrought well enough for a season. By and by Sir James's\
        \ letters became less frequent. At length they ceased altogether. Helen's\
        \ perplexity and distress can be easily imagined. She wrote him, complaining\
        \ of his silence, but had no response. The confidant pretended to write him\
        \ also to the same effect, but had no better success. He was not dead. No\
        \ misfortune had befallen him. Helen learned that the family in Cromlix were\
        \ constantly The Chisholms of Cromlix are an historic family for other reasons\
        \ than that they supplied Dunblane with three bishops. They were a branch\
        \ of the Chisholms, thought to have been of Norman extrac tion, who settled\
        \ in the Border as early as the reign of Alexander HI., and held lands in\
        \ both Berwick shire and Eoxburghshire. The first of them who possessed Cromlix\
        \ was Edmund, son of the Chisholms of Teviotdale. He came to Perthshire early\
        \ in the fifteenth century. The family soon became distin guished, and had\
        \ conferred on them the offices of Hereditary Bailie and Justiciar of the\
        \ ecclesiastical lordship of Dunblane. They were devotees of Rome ; offered\
        \ strenuous opposition to the Refor mation ; and after it was accomplished,\
        \ they were deeply implicated in the projects of the Popish fac tion for the\
        \ overthiow of the Reformed rehgion in the land. John Chisholm, son of Sir\
        \ James\xB0 third Chisholm laird of CromUx, lived chiefly in France,", 2]

        some overmastering emotion, as she came forward signing to Margaret to give
        her the support of her arm. Margaret sprang forward more bewildered than ever,
        but by this time Caleb stood at his cottage door waiting to admit his visitors,
        shading his old eyes with his hand, evidently at a loss to discover who they
        were. It was only when Margaret exclaimed, "Don''t you know me, Caleb ? "
        that Hugh from the gate perceived the companion of the increasingly mysterious
        native to be none other than the doctor''s daughter. He came hurrying forward,
        but by. this time the ladies were dis appearing into the cottage amid the
        old librarian''s expressions of delighted welcome. Hugh Hartleigh turned away,
        feeling much puzzled.', 1]
    - ['HARTLEIGH TOWERS. 124 Caleb, meanwhile, was rambling about the reading room
        setting things straight and pondering over what the doctor''s daughter had
        been saying about Emma. And now there was the young squire, and he would more
        than likely have some news about Dick Hayward, thought the old man, anxious
        to have a chance of con versation with one who had lately taken an active
        and kindly interest in all his troubles. He was not a little disappointed,
        therefore, when Hugh said presently, " I''ll look in again another day, Bartlett,"
        and, with a parting nod, walked off with Margaret, whom he volunteered to
        accompany across the common. Perhaps, however, the old librarian would not
        have been so disappointed had he known that out of this walk there grew a
        possible post for his granddaughter nearer than St. Oswald''s. Margaret happened
        to mention that her mission to the reading-room that day had been to try to
        dissuade Emma from going to town. " Why, if she wants work, there will be
        plenty to do at the Towers," suggested Hugh. " The old steward seems quite
        disgusted with the accession of light and air and general breeziness Mr. Belton
        has brought. Scores of housemaids wiU be wanted. I must ask', 1]

        seemed to continue during their walk across the common. She persisted in taking
        the most cheerful view of everything, and would not even permit any regretful
        tender sentiment on Margaret''s part as they walked along the familiar paths
        written over with so many memories of the doctor''s daughter. The rustic bench
        which made old Caleb''s summer observatory was taken away from the cottage
        door, but there was smoke curling from the tiny chimney which betokened some
        winter sociability within. " Dear old Caleb ! how nice it will be to see him
        again, and how surprised he will be to see me ! " said Margaret, with rising
        spirits as she opened the gate, and hurried along the little path. Mrs. Hilton
        mean while seemed wearied by her first walk, and paused for a moment, leaning
        on the little gate with her hands clasped, her long cloak thrown back, and
        her upturned face looking towards the white sun-lighted hills. The old librarian''s
        response to Margaret''s knock was rather slow, and she stood facing the common
        as she waited, when, to her surprise, she saw the tall figure of the young
        squire hurrying towards the cottage. She made a little exclamation, and was
        going to call Mrs. Hilton''s', 1]

        \ 1872, to Allen T. and Dale 0. Cowen (brothers), who con ducted it under\
        \ the firm-name of D. 0. Cowen & Co. In 1869, Mr. Leeds was elected State\
        \ senator for the Clermont and Brown senatorial district (the fourth), and\
        \ re elected in 1 S71, and served four years as a faithful, able, and industrious\
        \ member of the Senate, commanding the complete confidence of his friends\
        \ and the respect and esteem of his political adversaries. On one occasion,\
        \ while publishing the Sun, the mail-stage, which was then the only public\
        \ convey ance between Batavia and Cincinnati,\" owing to bad roads and high\
        \ water, failed to bring Mr. Leeds' paper for that week's issue. No alternative\
        \ was left him but to either miss his issue or to go after paper ; and, determined\
        \ not to disappoint his subscribers, he procured a horse, saddle, and bridle,\
        \ and started for Cincinnati about four o'clock p.m., and reached that city\
        \ late at night. Next morning he secured his bun dle of blank paper, took\
        \ it on his horse, holding it before him, and rode back with it, and issued\
        \ his paper on time. To carry a bundle of paper weighing nearly a hundred\
        \ pounds on horseback for twenty-one miles was no easy task, but he had never\
        \ yet disappointed his subscribers, and the Sun had to shine, whether or no,\
        \ as far as horseflesh was concerned. At another time Mr. Leeds went to Cincinnati\
        \ after paper, and during the night the Ohio River had risen very fast, and\
        \ the back-water was over the levee west of the old Union Bridge across the\
        \ Little Miami. He was in a light spring-wagon and alone, and concluded that\
        \ he could cross the water on the levee, and so made the venture. He soou\
        \ found the water was becoming deep, but there was nothing for him to do but\
        \ \" go forward,\" for to attempt to turn back was impossible. Large fields\
        \ of ice were afloat on the water, and his horse was often in water up to\
        \ his back, and he knew not how soon he and wagon and all would float off\
        \ the levee, and, of course, all go down together. Twice he was compelled\
        \ to stop for a time till the ice would float past and off the road, which\
        \ he could not distinguish from the muddy condition of the water, so that\
        \ he had to drive very carefully and steadily. Once the body of the wagon\
        \ was afloat, and every instant he expected to be swept away ; but he finally\
        \ succeeded in reaching the time-honored old bridge, and arrived home all\
        \ safe, and got out that number of his paper on time. Such were some of the\
        \ hardships and perils he was compelled to encounter in order to con duct\
        \ his business continuously, and that no disappointments should befall his\
        \ patrons. Mr. Leeds during the first ten years of his editorial life never\
        \ wrote his editorials, but set them up at the case, composing them as he\
        \ set the type ; and for many years he set up most of the Sun with his own\
        \ hands, worked the press, did up all the papers in packages for the mails\
        \ ; in other words, he did most of the work on the paper from necessity, \u2014\
        \ the income of the office not jus tifying the hiring of a single journeyman,\
        \ \u2014 keeping only one or two boys for assistance. Such was the work on\
        \ the Sun from 1840 to 1850, aud present publishers know but little of the\
        \ labors and difficulties which befel the early ones, even as late as the\
        \ year 1850, since which time improved ma chinery and various inventions have\
        \ greatly systematized printing and lessened its multiform trials and labors.\
        \ Allen T. Cowen (now the learned, dignified, ana popular judge of the Clermont\
        \ Common Pleas Court) was born in Batavia, in the house now occupied by D.\
        \ G. Dustin, and married, in 1861, Miss Kate Brown, a daughter of Mr. Carson\
        \ Brown, of Hamilton County, and on her maternal side descended from the Stites,\
        \ the first pioneers of Co lumbia. Dale 0. Cowen was born in June, 1845, in\
        \ the jail building which his father then occupied as sheriff, and was married\
        \ Feb. 11, 1873, to Miss Mary C. Dustin, daughter of the late Col. J. S. Dustin,\
        \ an old Batavia merchant. They were sons of Michael Cowen, who was born in\
        \ Bed ford County, Pa., in 1804, and came to Ohio about 1827, and married\
        \ Miss Mary Ann Roudebush on August 11, 1831. In 1841 and 1843 he was elected\
        \ sheriff, and served four years. He was a high-toned gentleman, of an iron\
        \ will, and true to every trust committed to his care, and died Sept. 16,\
        \ 1854, at Milford, universally mourned. In 1875, Allen T. Cowen sold out\
        \ his interest in the Sun to his brother (the youngest), Willis M. Cowen,\
        \ who was a practical printer, and thoroughly understood the busi ness, and\
        \ the name of the firm remained unchanged, and is to-day D. 0. Cowen & Co.,\
        \ who are the editors and pub lishers of the Clermont Sun. On the 3d of January,\
        \ 1877, Willis M. Cowen was married to J^ate D. Kerr, daughter of the former\
        \ proprietor. When the Cowen brothers took the Sun it had only seven hundred\
        \ subscribers, and now it has over fourteen hundred. They have erected on\
        \ Market Street a fine brick building, on the very site where stood the old\
        \ frame church where Henry Ward Beecher preached his first sermon when he\
        \ came out to Batavia one Sunday, from the Lane Divinity School near Cincinnati,\
        \ to make his first attempt in ex pounding the word of God. The Sun printing-office,\

        \ and hardly equaled by any other country office in the State, and it is gratifying\
        \ to record that the labors and enterprise of the firm have been generously\

        succeeded for a few months by the Rev. Robert Rankin. The pulpit hereto fore
        had been frequently occupied by his brother, the Rev. John Rankin, a noted
        abolitionist. In the fall of 1833 the Rev. Sayers Gazley succeeded to the
        charge of the church. He was from New England, a man of much learning and
        the author of several books, among them an extensive Biblical Commentary.
        He was a man of many striking peculiarities, among them a strange abhorrence
        for whist ling (which mischievous boys were not slow to practice upon) and
        an utter intolerance for the Free-soil views of Rev. John Rankin. He was an
        uncle on the maternal side to the distinguished Professor David Swing. E.
        Dozier, Nicholas Sinks, and George Peterson were ap pointed to select a site
        for the new house. Lot No. 213 was chosen, but the church building was not
        erected until 1845, and was consecrated the following year. It is a substantial
        brick building, and among those who were active in building it are given the
        names of John and George Peterson, L. T. Pease, Nicholas Sinks, S. S. Leffin"
        well, L. D. Salt, Jonathan Johnson, and W. L. Kain. The house is valued at
        $4000 and the parsonage in the village at $600. In the main the church at
        Williamsburgh has been prosperous, and its present membership approximates
        300. These form classes, which are led by G. A. McNutt, O. Dudley, William
        L. Kain, S. G. Peterson, James Ash ton, E. B. Holmes, and W. A. Kain. The
        latter is also the superintendent of the excellent Sunday-school main tained
        by the church, numbering at present 186 scholars. In 1841 the Bev. Ludwell
        G. Gaines was called to the pastorate. He was a man of liberal education,
        and to his clerical calling added the duties of a teacher, giving special
        attention to academic studies and the fitting of young men for college aud
        the professions. In 1849 he was succeeded by the Rev. Luke Ainsworth Spofford,
        a characteristic New Englander and the father of a noted family, among whom
        are Ainsworth Spofford, Librarian of Congress ; Judge Spofford, noted iu Kellogg-Spofford
        United States Senato rial contest, from Louisiana ; and Mrs. Lizzie Spofford
        Ware, now residing in Clermont County. The church has ever occupied an emphatic
        and decided position on the question of temperance, and in 1853 passed the
        following resolution : " Resolved, That as conscientious men and Christians,
        we feel called upon to use our best efforts in the cause of temperance ; therefore,
        we will not vote for any candidate for either brunch of the Legislature who
        is unwilling to use his influence to procure the Maine Liquor Law, or one
        similar in force thereto." Since that period it has not suffered this important
        work to be divorced from its other duties, and has always been radical on
        questions of reform. The Rev. John Wiseman was in charge of the church from
        1853 to 1857. He was born and educated in Scot land, and was a man of great
        force of character, and, like Mr. Gaines, was a schoolmaster. Then the Rev.
        Thomas F. Cortelyon was pastor until 1862. Rev. Charles French was then minister
        for a few months. He was succeeded by Rev. Thomas Chestnut until 1865, when
        the Rev. R. B. Herron was in charge from 1866 until 1870, aster which came
        the Revs. B. F. De Witt and John Mills for short periods each. Until 1S73
        the pulpit was supplied by students from Lane Seminary. Until 1838, the church,
        in common with others in the northern part of the county, belonged to Miami
        and Mil ford Circuits, and had their ministerial service. From 1838 until
        September, 1851, it belonged to Batavia Circuit, and the names of the ministers
        appear in a history of that church, but since the latter date Williamsburgh
        has been a separate charge, with or without other appointments. The ministers
        have been as follows : 1851, L. P. Miller ; 1852, B. P. Wheat; 1853, A. Murphy,
        John Smith; 1854, A. Murphy, Levi Thomas; 1855, W. E. Hines, James H. Middleton

        ; 1877-79, W. M. Boyer. Bev. John B. Smith commenced his services with the
        church in December, 1873, aud continued until July, 1877, when he resigned
        to accept the presidency of the Ohio Farmers'' College. In 1876 the church
        received a legacy of $2000, in trust, from one of its members, H. J. Walker.
        Rev. S. M. Crissman became pastor of the church in Oc tober, 1877, and so
        continues to the present. The church cousists of 125 members, and after passing
        through many vicissitudes, is in a fairly prosperous conditiou. The Sun day
        school has about 150 pupils, with George B. Beacham for superintendent. The
        present officers of the church are Elders A. S. Walker, Israel Foster, Thomas
        Moorhead, and John A. Juukin ; Deacons Israel Foster and James Hageman. CLOVER
        CHAPEL OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. On the 29th of August, 1804, William
        Winters and Peter Light executed a deed for a lot for church purposes at Clover
        to Amos Smith, Joshua Lambert, Wm. Smith, Moses Bumsey, Ephraim Duke, Samuel
        Nelson, Samuel Nutt, Augustus Clark, and Thomas Lemon as trustees. These began
        a hewed log house in the course of a few years, which was never wholly finished,
        yet preaching was held there several years; and ever since 1804 Methodist
        preach ing has been maiutained with more or less regularity in the Clover
        neighborhood. The next place of preaching was in the school -house, but about

        The early history of this body is somewhat obscure, but among the members
        were the Kain, Foster, Peterson, and other families, whose descendants are
        yet prominent members of the church. The first meetings were held in the court
        house, but about 1825 a frame house of worship was erected ip the northern
        part of the village, which since 1845 has been used for other purposes, and
        is at present the resi depee of James McAdams. The first action relative to

        the establishment, and chose for his motto, " Be just and fear not. Let all
        the ends thou aimest at be thy country''s, thy God''s, and truth''s;" but
        before this Mr. Leeds, in 1844, had changed its name to The Clermont Sun,
        which it has borne to this hour. Henry V. Kerr (the present State librarian)
        became the owner of the Sun in 1864, and Mr. Leeds retired to other fields
        of labor. He was so long identified with journalism in the county that a short
        sketch of this Nestor of the press will be read with general interest. On
        Feb. 2, 1854, E. T. Norton purchased a half-inter est in the Sun, also doing
        editorial work, and continued on it till June 8th, when, having been chosen
        editor of the Daily Dispatch, of Portsmouth, he sold his interest to Will
        C. Walker. On June 24, 1854, Mr. Thompson died, in his twenty-ninth year of
        age, after an illness of short du ration and unexpectedly to the community.
        He was born in Indiana Co., Pa., in 1825, and at seventeen years of age took
        charge of a newspaper in his native State, and subse quently successfully
        conducted the management of several others, among which were the Perry Freeman,
        at New Bloomfield ; The Register, at Mifflintown ; the Age, at New Richmond,
        Ohio ; and the Clermont Sun. Learner B. Leeds was born in Clermont, of pioneer
        parents, July 16, 1816, and followed the occupation of a farmer till his nineteenth
        year, when (in October, 1S35) he was apprenticed to the printing business,
        under the late Governor Samuel Medary, of The Ohio Sun, at Batavia. After
        serving out his apprenticeship with Samuel Medary and his successors, his
        brothers Jacob and Asher C., he went to Cincinnati in the fall of 183S, and
        worked until the ensuing spring on The Cincinnati Gazette, under the dis tinguished
        Charles Hammond (now deceased), its editor. In the spring of 1839 he went
        with Amos Derrough into a new printing-office at Georgetown, Brown Co., Ohio,
        which Mr. Derrough had established and called the Democratic Standard, and
        of which he was foreman for a few weeks, when he bought out the paper. He
        conducted this sheet as editor, publisher, and printer for nearly ten months,
        then sold out, returned to Cincinnati, and worked till late in the fall of
        1840 on The Philanthropist, an able anti-slavery paper, edited at that time
        by the world-renowned Gamaliel Bailey. In November, 1840, he bought the Ohio
        Sun, at Batavia, which he conducted as publisher and editor from Dec. 7, 1840,
        to the last week of March, 1864, with the exception of less than three years
        during the time. He was elected recorder of Clermont County in 1847, and re
        elected in 1850, and served three years. In 1844 he united with the Masonic
        Order, at Batavia, was six years Worship ful Master of its lodge, and one
        year Most Excellent High Priest of the chapter. In 1854 he joined the Independent
        Order of Odd-Fellows, and in 1868 became a Royal and Select Master in the
        council. In these two orders he was always a zealous and an active member.
        In the spring of 1864 he purchased the Southern Ohio Argus, the Demo cratic
        organ at Georgetown, Ohio, of the Brown County Democracy, and changed its
        name to that of The Brown County News, which he to this day publishes. It
        is a large On Aug. 3, 1854, the one-half of the paper belonging to the estate
        of J. P. Thompson was sold to Andrew J. Sprague, a practical printer, who
        had learned the art under an apprenticeship to Learner B. Leeds, many years
        before, and who had worked a long time on this paper, as well as on the leading
        Cincinnati dailies. The following from the Cincinnati Daily Gazette, of July
        30, 1S50, shows that Mr. Sprague was the best and fastest printer at that
        time in America : "A TYPO AS IS ONE. "Mr. Andrew J. Sprague, one of the compositors
        engaged on the Daily Gazette, has, during the past seven consecutive working
        days, set up an aggregate of 90,750 ems, correcting his own proofs and dis
        tributing his own matter. This is an average of 13,000 ems per day. An old-fasbioued
        day''s work was 5000, and it is agood workman who now regularly sets 0000
        or 7000 per day, and a quick one who aver ages 7000 to 8000. Mr. Sprague belongs
        to '' the fast line'' most de cidedly, and can ''go through by daylight''
        any time." This was a handsome compliment to Mr. Sprague, and his big time
        at the case called forth all over the Union congratulations and encomiums
        from the leading journals and periodical press. On Feb. 8, 1855, Mr. Will
        C. Walker sold his half interest to Smith Townsley, a good printer, and for

        \ distracted as to what he should call her, feeling ' miss ' disagreeable,\
        \ he hardly knew why, but, despite the wealth of the English language, having\
        \ no other alternative than a bold ' you.' She relieved his mind as if she\
        \ had understood his thoughts. ' My name is Adrienne Blisset,' said she '\

        \ of dealing thus summarily with a person of the consideration of Frederick\

        \ and hard \u2014 not as if she read for pleasure, but for work\u2014 with\

        \ inclusive ; N. D. Fratt, of Racine, was elected for 1878, 1879, 1880 and\
        \ 1881. Albert C. Ingham was Secretary in 1851, 1852, 1853 and 1854 ; George\

        \ the society has entered upon its thirtieth year ; that all of its secretaries,\
        \ with the exception of W. W. Field, have been citizens of Dane County. The\
        \ society owns fair grounds in connection with Dane County near the University\
        \ of Wisconsin. It has held twenty-seven exhibitions, nine of which have been\
        \ held in Madison, and its officers say with pride that they have never compromised\
        \ a debt or a premium, but have always paid at the rate of a hundred cents\
        \ on the dollar. The society has printed eighteen volumes of five hundred\
        \ pages each. Seven thousand of these volumes are yearly distributed to the\
        \ people of the State. While the society is in effect a State institution,\
        \ its home is in Dane County, and the yearly exhibits' of the citizens of\
        \ the county show that they appreciate it and believe in its good works. It\
        \ has commodious rooms in the Capitol, which are much visited by people from\
        \ abroad. It has a library of fifteen hundred volumes, a fine mineral collection\
        \ and some exhibits of works of art. It is a department of the State that\
        \ all its people should foster, for, while Wisconsin has some grand commercial\
        \ cities, her greatness and glory will depend largely upon the tillers of\
        \ her soil. WISCONSIN STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The Wisconsin State Horticultural\

        \ results of the practice and experiments of fruit-grow ers in all parts of\

        volumes ; he was associated with Lyman C. Draper, LL. D., the Corresponding
        Secretary, to both of whom the society is indebted largely for its present
        prosperity ; this institution now ranks among the first in the United States
        in number of volumes and the value of its collections. Mr. Durrie published
        his first work, "A Genealogical History of John and George Steele, Settlers
        of Hartford, Conn., 1635-36, and their De scendants," in 1859, and an enlarged

        and Town Histories, Printed Genealogies and Kindred Works," a volume of 300
        pages ; this work was subsequently revised and enlarged, and published in
        1878, and has proved a most useful book to all students; in 1869 he prepared
        and published in the " Historical Magazine" a" Bibliography of the State of
        Wisconsin." giving the title and reference to all publications that have been
        issued on the State, a volume of great service to all persons interested in
        Wisconsin and her history and resources, and pro poses to issue an enlarged
        edition of the same at an early day; in 1872 he prepared two historical papers
        on " The Early Outposts of Wisconsin," "Green Bay, for Two Hundred Years,
        1639 to 1839," and " Annals of Prairie du Chien," which appeared in pamphlet
        form, and also an article on Capt. Jonathan Carver, an early traveler in Wisconsin,

        ; the work was completed, but, owing to the civil war, the publi cation was
        suspended, and it has never been published ; in the year 1875, he assisted
        C. R. Tuttle in the preparation of his histories of Wisconsin and Iowa; in
        1876 he prepared an historical address for the twenty-fifth anniversary of
        the organization of the Presbyterian Church at Madison, which was published
        that year in pamphlet form ; of this church, Mr. Durrie and his wife were
        members at its organization, and still retain their connection with it ; and
        in the same year he was associated with W. B. Davis in writing a history of
        Missouri, which was published at St. Louis; in 1877, he prepared a paper on
        the "Public Domain of Wisconsin" for Snyder & Van Vechtcn''s " Historical

        The subject of this sketch was bora March 23, A. D. 1819, in Web ster, Monroe
        Co., N. Y. He was the son of Gerard Dunning, a substantial farmer of Monroe
        County. His mother''s name previous to her marriage was Polly Hicks. Philo''s
        early advantages of scholastic dis cipline were only such as the common schools
        afforded to farmer boys of the period, generally consisting of a short term
        in the winter, the balance of his time being occupied in performing the laborious
        tasks of the farm. The first use he made of his independence on attaining
        his majority, was to shake off all the associations of home, and take up his
        line of march for the West, toward which even then the " course of empire
        " began to point the way. He reached Madison, Wis., in 1840. For about two
        years he worked at whatever his hands could find to do, which afforded the
        means of subsistence, and the hope of laying up "something for a wet day."
        His labors were directed to a single purpose, the consummation of a cherished
        aim, and that was the pur chase of a home for himself and the future bride,
        who in the distant East awaited his return to claim her willing hand. In order
        to accomplish his hope, he practiced the most rigid economy, often denying
        him self the pleasure of corresponding with his Eastern friends, because each
        letter in those days cost 25 cents postage in hard money. In 1842, he had
        already realized a sum sufficient to enter 120 acres of land, upon "which
        he worked, keeping bachelor''s hall, and boarding himself, until 1844, when
        he returned to his native place for the purpose of claiming his promised bride.
        He was married, at Webster, N. Y., on Sept. 27, 1844, to Miss Sophia Goodenow,
        and with his wife soon returned to Wisconsin. In 1845, he exchanged his farm
        for a saw-mill near Madison. This exchange proved to be a profitable one for
        him,', 1]

        \ Wisconsin honored with a full professorship in the institution ; he was\
        \ born Jan. 12, 1846, in Albion, Dane Co., Wis.; his parents came to America\

        \ and Norway ; his father was the leader of the first large company of emigrants\
        \ that came from Norway to the United States; he settled in Wisconsin in September,\
        \ 1841. He early evinced energy and love of learning, got through the home\
        \ common school at 12, and sought further instruction of the Lutheran parish\
        \ priest, who endeavored to secure his talents for the church ; at 14, he\
        \ began to shape his own career ; was three years at Decorah College, Iowa,\
        \ and except during that time, directed his own studies, while supporting\
        \ himself; in June, 1866, he became Professor of Greek and Modern Languages\

        \ of Scandinavian Languages and Literature was created for him, which position\
        \ he continues to fill with credit and ability. His purpose, which is now\

        \ of the Northwest into the American common schools and universities. The\
        \ Scandinavian priests establish parochial schools and chureh colleges, and\
        \ would keep their people in isolated communi ties. Prof. Anderson's controversies\
        \ with them have concerned this tendency. His motto is, \" Whoso ever directly\
        \ or indirectly opposes the American common school is an enemy of education,\
        \ liberty and progress; opposition to the common school is treason to our\
        \ country.\" fie has brought to the university an average yearly attendance\

        the Library law, and transferred the money to the school and general funds,
        so that the latter might aid in equipping our first regiments for the war.
        Gov. Randall, in his annual message in January, 1859, thus spoke of Mr. Draper''s
        report: "The Superintendent of Public Instruction has made a very voluminous
        and able report. It indicates great thought and labor, and will be of great
        value. It exhibits better than has ever been done before, the eonditioD of
        our schools, the character of our system, and the resources at command for
        their support." Horace Mann, who has justly been styled the apostle of free
        schools, said of Mr. Draper''s report: " It presents the most persuasive and
        effective argument in favor of education that has ever been offered to the
        world." Fine words these, coming from so noble a source. The State Legislative
        Investigating Committee, who annually examined into all the Wisconsin State
        Departments, gave, through their Chairman, Hon. M. M. Davis, the following
        testimony in their report, in 1859, to Mr. Draper''s efficiency and faithfulness
        as a public officer : " The examination into the office of the Superintendent
        of Public Instruction has been brought down to February, 1859, and the committee
        are most happy to find that the present Superintendent, Lyman C, Draper, has
        established a new order of things from that heretofore found in the management
        of that department. All the duties of the office are discharged with promptness,
        and accurate records of all the transactions arc kept. Great credit is due
        Mr. Draper for the industry and efficiency with which he has discharged the
        duties of his responsible office." In Hon. W. C. Whitford''s " Historical
        sketch of Education in Wisconsin," prepared for the National Centennial of
        1876, occurs this highly complimentary paragraph: " Hon. Lyman C. Draper,
        of Madison, was Superintendent in the years 1858 and 1859. He had been for
        many years the efficient Secretary of the State Historical Society. He collected
        reliable statistics, showing the actual condition of the public schools; and
        he organized the work of his department, which had been sadly neglected. The
        efficient system of conducting Teachers'' Institute''s, was inaugurated while
        he was in office, and has continued in force until the present time. He procured,
        during his term, the passage of an excellent law for establish ing town school
        libraries. He wrote largely upon this subject in his reports, aud awakened
        much interest* for it in different parts of the State. After a fund of $88,784.78
        had accumulated for the benefit of these libraries, the law was very unwisely
        repealed in 1861, and the money transferred to the school and general funds.
        It is due to this enterprise, and to this indefatigable laborer, that this
        money should be refunded by the State, and this law revived. If this measure
        had been put in force, and prosecuted vigorously for a few years, it would
        have furnished an excellent basis for the introduction of the township system
        of managing schools." The late President, Daniel Read, of the Missouri State
        University, in some remarks at the Librarians'' Convention at Philadelphia,
        in October, 1876, said : ''The Hon. Lyman C. Draper, of Madison, Wis., who
        is well known as practically the founder of the Wisconsin State Historical
        Library, when elected State Superintendent of Education, brought forward as
        his great measure, a scheme of school libraries ; and the Legislature, responding
        to his views, provided over $88,000 to carry it out, which, however, upon
        the war breaking out, was diverted to the immediate necessities of the times.
        No measure is more popu lar or more generally acceptable with all classes
        than this provision for the intellectual food of the people. It has proved
        so everywhere." We can most heartily indorse the words of Dr. Read and President
        Whitford, and join the latter in the earnest hope that Mr. Draper may live
        to see his ideas in regard to township libraries realized. They are a lasting
        monument to his wisdom and patriotism. A zealous watch-care over the school
        fund also engaged his attention. " We must award to Mr. Draper," said the
        Janesville Gazette and Free Press, of May 8, 1858, "great credit for his able
        and clear school report upon a subject of vital importance to the welfare
        of the people of this State. His report is timely, too, submitted, as it is,
        when there is au effort making to divert a large portion of the school fund
        to other purposes. He takes strong ground against the transfer of another
        25 per cent of the swamp land fund to the drainage fund, which would take
        from the school fund 50 per cent of the swump. land fund. We hope the members
        of the Legislature will study well the facts and suggestions of Mr. Draper,
        and listen to his appeal in behalf of the 250,000 children now living in our
        midst, and of millions yet unborn. '' Whoever,'' says Mr. Draper, ''attempts
        to divert any portion of our sacred school fund from its consecrated purposes
        of education, should feel that lie is treading on holy ground.'' We may add,
        too, that it is dangerous ground for all who desire to stand well with the
        voters of this State hereafter. We do not hesitate to say, that after the
        forcible exposition of this matter given by the Superintendent, no man is
        fit to be a legislator who will vote to increase the drainage fund at the
        expense of the school fund." When Mr. Draper was chosen Superintendent of

        \ with the approval of the other members. James Clarke, publisher of the Belmont\
        \ Gazette, and first Territorial printer, was the first Librarian. The first\
        \ appropriation by the State to replenish the library was made in 1851. The\
        \ sum of $2,500 was then appropriated, to be expended under direction of Gov.\
        \ Dewey in the purchase of law books. Subsequently, in 1854, the sum of $3,000\
        \ was appropriated for law and miscel laneous works; and in 1857, the additional\
        \ appropriation of $1,000 was made for the same purpose, together with a standing\
        \ appropriation of $250 for such additions to the law and miscel laneous departments\
        \ of the library as might from time to time be deemed desirable. In 1864,\
        \ the annual appropriation was increased to $300, and two years later the\
        \ additional sum of S$600 was placed at the disposal of the Governor for the\
        \ purpose of supplying deficiencies in the law department. These appropriations\
        \ were continued until 1877, when the annual ap propriation was increased\
        \ to $1,500. The purchase of miscellaneous works for the library was virtually\
        \ discontinued in 1866, except that purchases were subsequently made for completing\
        \ imperfect sets of works of refer ence. In 1875, the miscellaneous works\

        B. Braley; Secretary, William F. Allen; Librarian, Miss Jennie M. Field, Miss
        Robbins declining a re-election. During the year ending July 1, 1878, the
        Common Council of the city of Madison assigned for the use of the library
        and reading-rooms, the present commodious and pleasant rooms in the city hall,
        which were well, substantially and handsomely repaired and fitted for the
        purposes of the library at a cost of $781.36, under the direction of a committee
        of the Board of Directors, consisting of George P. Delaplaine, J. C. Ford
        and J. J. Suhr. July 8, 1878, the same officers were re-elected, with the
        exception that Mrs. Laura H. Feuling was chosen Librarian in place of Miss
        Field, declining a re-election. During the year, the duties of the Librarian
        having largely increased, she was authorized to employ an assistant for certain
        hours of the week. Upon the completion of the present rooms used by the library,
        and on the 1st day of January, 1879, the Board of Directors were enabled to
        open a reading-room in connection with the library, and placed it temporarily
        under charge of the Librarian, then for the first time putting into operation
        and life all the departments con templated by the statute and ordinance under
        which the free library was organized. At the annual meeting of the Board of
        Directors, held on the 14th day of July, 1879, the same officers were elected
        for the ensuing year, and Miss Ella A. Giles was elected Librarian, Mrs. Feuling,
        declining a re-election, and Miss Minnie Oakley was chosen Superintendent
        of reading room and Assistant Librarian. On the 12th day of July, 1880, the
        officers of 1879 were re-elected. The Board of Directors first chosen were
        W. F. Allen, F. H. Firmin, J. J. Suhr, J. R. Baltzell, G. P. Delaplaine, A.
        Sexton, A. B. Braley, J. C. Ford and H. M. Lewis. The board still remains
        the same, excepting that Miss Genevieve Mills was elected to Mr. Ford''s place
        in July, 1880, serving until September following, when she resigned, and C.
        N. Gregory was appointed in her place. At the present time there are over

        \ had been the subject of public dis- cussion during 1845 and 1846, and, in\
        \ October of the latter year, a meeting was held for that purpose at Madison.\
        \ A. Hyatt Smith was chosen President; Messrs. Doty and Burnett, Vice Presidents;\
        \ Thomas W. Sutherland, Secretary; E. M. Williamson, Treasurer; all to hold\
        \ their respective appointments until the annual meeting, which was fixed\
        \ for January, 1847. At the first annual meeting, Morgan L. Martin was chosen\
        \ President, and the other officers were re-elected. The second annual meeting,\
        \ in January, 1848, was slimly attended, but the organi- zation was not abandoned,\
        \ and W. R. Smith was chosen President for the ensuing year. The success of\
        \ the society had not, so far, met the expectations of its founders and friends,\
        \ and, in January, 1849, a meeting was held for the purpose of creating a\
        \ new organization, with a view to increasing the membership and to secure\
        \ a more efficient co-operation in the collection of ma- terial for such a\
        \ society on the part of early settlers and prominent citizens throughout\
        \ the State. A new organization was effected ; the Governor, Nelson Dewey,\
        \ was made ex officio President of the society ; I. A. Lapham, Corresponding\
        \ Secretary ; Charles Lord, Recording Secretary, and one Vice President was\
        \ chosen for each of the twenty-five counties then organ- ized. When L. J.\
        \ Farwell became Governor of the State, and President of the Society, in 1852,\
        \ he directed a full set of the Territorial and State laws and journals to\
        \ be placed in the society's library. These, together with two volumes of\
        \ Proceedings of the American Ethnological Society, presented by Frank Hudson,\
        \ comprised the total works in the library in October, 1852. After a newspaper\
        \ discussion, during a part of 1853, regarding some minor differences, the\
        \ Society was re-organized in January, 1854, under a charter obtained from\
        \ the Legislature in March, 1853, when W. R. Smith was chosen President ;\
        \ J. W. Hunt, Librarian ; 0. M. Con- over, Treasurer; Charles Lord, Recording\
        \ Secretary; Lyman C. Draper, Corresponding Sec retary ; and S. H. Carpenter,\
        \ Librarian. In 1855, Daniel S. Durrie was chosen Librarian ; Messrs. Durrie\
        \ and Draper have ever since held their respective offices. From the date\
        \ of its re-organization to the present time, the society has had a prosperous\
        \ career. It occupies the second floor of the south wing of the State House\
        \ for its collections. Its officers claim to have 90,000 books, pamphlets\
        \ and documents. There are collected here files, more or less complete, of\
        \ nearly all the newspapers of the State. The Society has accumulated a number\
        \ of prehistoric copper implements and Indian relics, and has published eight\
        \ volumes of historical collections. Many portraits of pi:neers and noted\
        \ citizens belong to the society. The library has, by action of the society\
        \ and the State, become, for all practical purposes, a State library. Liberal\
        \ appropria tions for the purchase of books and for the salaries of its officers,\
        \ are made by the Legislature annually. The officers of the society from its\
        \ first organization are as follows : Presidents \u2014 A. Hyatt Smith, 1846\
        \ ; Morgan L. Martin, 1847 ; William R. Smith, 1848 ; Nelson Dewey, 1849-51\

        \ of Wisconsin, and are under control of offleeri not appointed by the Stmte.\

        first, the author desires at this time to make two special ac knowledgments.
        Upon the period embraced in the second volume, much new light has recently
        been shed by publica tions of the later Adamses, members of an American family
        already exceptionally illustrious through four successive gen erations of
        vigorous statesmen and thinkers. Among these publications the Diary of John
        Quincy Adams and the Life and Works of Albert Gallatin here deserve especial
        mention. The author''s other acknowledgment relates to the Monroe Correspondence,
        at present a huge mass of interesting matter relative to our earlier national
        history, which lies unassorted in the Department of State, and for whose editorial
        supervision and publication it is to be fervently hoped that Congress will
        some day make suitable provision. Through the courtesy of the late Secretary
        of State, Hon. William M. Evarts, and the accomplished Librarian, Mr. Theodore
        W. D wight, the present writer has been permitted, as the first probably among
        students engaged in such research, to make copious notes from this truly rich
        historical material. Encouraged by the reception of his first volume, the
        author announces his full decision, if life, health, and opportunity are spared
        him, to continue researches into our national his tory, so as to bring the
        narrative gradually down to the end of Buchanan''s administration and the
        great conflict of 1861. To this task he pledges his personal investigation

        upon certain specifications and limits of time, which upon a deeper consideration
        was deemed perplexing and impractical. An animated discussion arose not long
        since, regarding the correct author ship of this important ordinance, and
        its chief worker in gaining its sanction by Congress. Mr. AVebster ascribed
        its authorship to Mathew Dane, of Massachusetts, which statement was immediately
        refuted by Mr. Benton, of Mississippi, who laid claim to it as the birthright
        of Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia. It has been almost impossible to obtain
        accurate reports of the actions of the old Continental Congress, from the
        fact that its meetings were held in secret, and any reports either narrated
        or shown in schedules or lists, were deemed a striking lack of trust on the
        part of the person who furnished the information. It was sufficient that its
        acts and conclusions be proclaimed without any prelude or reasoning process.
        Hence it has been difficult to obtain early Congressional documents. But it
        has been conclusively proven that the great motive power in gaining the approbation
        of the Ordinance of 1787, was neither Dane nor Jefferson, but Dr. Cutler.
        He arrived at New York, July 5 of that year, after a journey from Ipswich,
        Mass., in his sulky. He obtained lodgings at the "Plow and Harrow," and saw
        that his good horse was properly cared for and fed at the same place. Congress
        was then in session, and he had come on a mission for the Ohio Com pany, to
        negotiate their grant and its privileges in the new Territory of Ohio. He
        remained in New York three weeks, constantly engaged in the work vital to
        the interests of the future great State. But he secured the installment of
        the principles deemed the corner-stone of a future powerful State constitution.
        Mr. Poole, Librarian of the Chicago Public Library, searched assiduously for
        con clusive proof of Dr. Cutler''s right to this honor, and in the North American
        Review, Vol. 122, this is emphatically set forth with substantiating proof
        under his signature. Other facts have been discussed and proven at a very
        recent date, relative to the State of Ohio, which heretofore have been omitted,
        and nearly lost from the historic thread which unites the present with the
        past. The first settlement of the lands of the Northwest is necessarily surrounded
        with interest. But those were exciting, troublesome times, and a few links
        were passed over lightly. However, the years are not so far removed in the
        past but the line may be traced. Mr. Francis W. Miller, of Cincinnati, has
        supplied some missing chapters. The earliest documentary trace extant, regarding
        the southern settlement at Cincinnati, is an agreement of partnership between
        Denman, Filson and Pat terson, in the fractional section of land to which
        the city of Cincinnati was originally limited. It bears the date August 25,
        1788. This was entered on the records of Hamilton County, Ohio, October 6,
        1803.', 1]

        \ Agricultural Society was held December 5. 1846, at which, an appropriation\
        \ was made for the purchase of a library, aster which, Mr. Thomas. President\

        \ which was discussed in a masterly manner, and listened to with rapt attention,\
        \ by an appreciative audience. That his remarks had a practical bearing, may\
        \ be inferred from the fact, that the board immediately resolved that the\
        \ circulation of the Ohio Cultivator among the mem bers, would be highly conducive\
        \ to their interests, and the same was therefore recommended to the farmers\
        \ for their patronage. The library was purchased in the winter of 1846, about\
        \ $70 having been previously appropriated for that pur pose. The second annual\

        \ of the General Court passed May 1, 1779, entitled \"an Act for dividing\
        \ and setting off the southerly part of the First Parish in the Town of Cambridge,\
        \ in the County of Middlesex, into a separate Precinct,\" the much desired\
        \ object was obtained. A few families on the south side, named in the act,\
        \ who preferred not to be separated, were specially exempted from all charges\
        \ to the South, or Third Parish, and allowed to remain members of the North,\
        \ or First Parish. During the interval between the erection of the church\
        \ in 1744 and the ordination of the first minister in 1784 the pulpit was\
        \ supplied by various clergymen, chiefly from Cambridge. We have seen that\
        \ for twelve or fifteen years before the meeting-house was built religious\
        \ services were held on this side of the river in a private house. A file\
        \ of ancient receipts for sums paid officiating clergymen for services rendered\
        \ has been preserved. These venerable vouchers are interesting in them selves,\
        \ in this lapse of years, as autographs of some few among the preachers enumerated\
        \ who subse quently attained celebrity; but chiefly interesting for the varying\
        \ phraseology employed by these literary men to designate this portion of\
        \ Cam bridge. All the forms of expression which we have quoted near the opening\
        \ of this article as familiar names of the place are used, to the almost entire\
        \ exclusion of the expression \" Little Cam bridge.\" Indeed, one expression\
        \ we find in these papers not before recognized anywhere in our search amidst\
        \ Cambridge records. The voucher embodying it runs thus : \" Cambridge, February\
        \ 23d, 1750. Received of Mr. Samuel Phipps, the sum of Forty Pounds, Old Tenor\
        \ in full for preach ing to a Society in Cambridge.\" Above the words, \"\
        Society in Cambridge,\" are cares ully . interlined the words \" one quarter\
        \ of.\" So we should read, \" in a quarter or section of Cambridge.\" These\
        \ stated pulpit stipends are enumerated in pounds, shillings, and pence, and\
        \ vary with the changing value of money in the Revolutionary period. The forty\
        \ pounds just cited cover ser vices for several Sabbaths, as the usual remunera\
        \ tion was about five pounds, Old Tenor, for a single Sabbath. Would space\
        \ allow, the statement of these exact sums might be interesting to some modern\

        \ limit of fifty pages of this work is to be re- lated the history of Cambridge.\
        \ The undertaking is not an easy one. The space is narrow and the story long.\
        \ Not only is Cambridge one of the very old est of the Middlesex munici palities,\
        \ but its long annals are densely crowded with detail, and The history of\
        \ Cambridge begins at the point when the era of American exploration and discovery\
        \ was just merging into that of settlement and occu- pation. The finger of\
        \ European enterprise had been busy for a century in tracing the outline of\
        \ the Atlantic coast of the new-found continent, and in laying down the course\
        \ of the majestic rivers of the vast limitless interior upon the rude maps\
        \ of the time. The French had planted their first colonies in Nova Scotia\
        \ and Canada; the English had followed in Maine and Virginia; the Dutch had\
        \ established themselves at the mouth of the Hudson River. When, in 1620,\
        \ the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, the New World was substan- tially a virgin\
        \ wilderness ; the territory which was to become New England was, at least,\
        \ an unbroken solitude, save for the savage. Eight years passed away, and\
        \ a second colony, chartered by the Plym- outh Company of \" knights, gentlemen,\
        \ and mer- chants,\" and headed by John Endicott, followed, entered the harbor\
        \ of what is now Salem, and planted a settlement there. The next two years\
        \ witnessed other accessions, the most important one being that which included\
        \ John Winthrop. Charlestown was definitely settled not later than 1629, and\
        \ the year 1630 found plantations of English settlers at Dorchester, Boston,\
        \ Watertown, Roxbury, Mystic, and Saugus, as well as at Plym- outh and Salem,\
        \ \u2014 nine in all. These were the nine sources of the Commonwealth of Massachu\
        \ setts and the confederated New England life ; to be, in turn, the fountain\
        \ of the republic. are further complicated by reason of peculiar ter ritorial\
        \ features and an uncommon interlacing of distinct but mutually dependent\
        \ lines of event. With the parallelism of civil and ecclesiastical structure\
        \ and life, afforded by the early period of every New England town, is here\
        \ blended the addi tional element of the founding of a college and the growth\
        \ of a university. To pick these three threads out of the general fabric and\
        \ braid them afresh into one compact and symmetrical strand is the present\
        \ object. Fortunately there is a wealth of materials. Cambridge has always\
        \ stood in a strong historic light. Not only the writings of the colonial\
        \ fathers, like Winthrop and the Mathers, and the additions of later annalists,\
        \ like Prince and Holmes, are before the modern writer, but also elaborate\
        \ and exhaustive monographs upon Harvard College, like those of Librarian\
        \ Peirce and President Quincy; while very recently the work of Dr. Paige Jias\
        \ brought together the results of a quarter of a cen tury of patient, laborious,\
        \ and loving investigation. Upon the latter special dependence has been placed\
        \ in the preparation of this sketch. Such being our opportunity, the most\
        \ that we can count on taking here is a general survey, \u2014 a bird's-eye\
        \ view as from a summit commanding the whole field, wdiich will not gather\
        \ in every par ticular of the landscape, but rather its general expression\
        \ ; not every farm, fence, brook, pond, tree, and stone, as it were, and not\
        \ more than the main divisions of field and forest, the larger lakes, the\
        \ more important streams, those alternations of The character of the first\
        \ years of Cambridge history may be well epitomized to the eye by the changes\
        \ which the earliest name of the settlement underwent. Thus : \" The newe\

        \ Edward Holyoke and Joseph Willard, of the University, came frequently \"\
        \ across the river \" to preach, and their signatures are with the foregoing.\
        \ names are aU recorded ; and in the loving words of their pastor, Rev. Dr.\
        \ Appleton, then nearly ninety years of age, recommended them to the work\
        \ of church embodiment and invoked upon them the benediction of God. In the\
        \ same Christian spirit were other residents, worshippers of the congregation\
        \ here, dismissed and recommended from the church at Newton, of which they\
        \ were members, under Rev. Jonathan Homer, from the church at Menotomy (West\
        \ Cam bridge) under Rev. Samuel Cooke, and from the First Church in Brookline\
        \ under Rev. Mr. Jack son. Some thirty persons in all were thus united to\
        \ join in church state. The covenant, breathing a liberal spirit, but which\
        \ was superseded during the ministry of the second pastor, Rev. Daniel Austin,\
        \ was read on the occasion, and the church was formally embodied by Rev. Mr.\
        \ Jackson of Brookline, February 27, 1783. The ancient records allude naturally\
        \ to these ministerial services. Committees are regularly chosen to \"Provide\

        \ as im plied in the following votes relating to selecting the tune and lining\
        \ off the psalm: \" March 21, 1749 \u2014 50. Voted, That Mr. Wm. Brown be\
        \ desired to read the Psalm on the Sabbath for the future.\" \"March 29, 1751.\

        \ amidst all this preaching and psalm singing, that the carnal wants of these\
        \ ministers, wdio came \" across the river,\" were duly provided for, the\
        \ following record, repeated at earlier and later periods of this hitherto\
        \ pastorless church, has been preserved: \"November 30, 17(37. Voted, That\
        \ Mr. James Bryant entertain the ministers at a quarter of a dollar per day.\"\
        \ If the price of articles of food which go to make up the average Sunday\
        \ dinner of to-day ruled in those earlier times, no better regulation could\
        \ have been devised to repel drowsiness from those college tutors and presidents\
        \ and their brother preachers while the sands in the pulpit hourglass were,\
        \ perhaps, run ning out for the second time. The ordination of its first pastor,\
        \ Rev. John Foster, who had previously preached as a candi date, was on Monday,\
        \ November 1, 1784. Rev. Joel Foster of New Salem, brother of the pastor elect,\
        \ preached the sermon; Rev. Ebenezer Spar hawk of Templeton, a native of this\
        \ place, offered the prayer of ordination ; Rev. Mr. Jackson of Brookline\
        \ gave the charge ; Rev. Mr. Hilliard of the First Church, Cambridge, gave\
        \ the right hand of fellowship ; and Rev. Mr. Eliot of Watertown offered the\
        \ concluding prayer. Rev. Dr. Foster was born in Western, now War ren, Massachusetts,\
        \ April 19, 1763, and graduated at Dartmouth College in 1783. He was married\
        \ in Boston, April, 1785, by Rev. Dr. Lathrop of the Second Church, to Hannah,\
        \ daughter of Grant Webster. They had three sous and three daugh ters. Allibone,\
        \ in his Dictionary of Authors, mentions Mrs. Foster as having produced in\
        \ The Coquette ; or, History of Eliza Wharton, one of the earliest American\
        \ novels ; and two of her daughters, Mrs. Cushing and Mrs. Cheney, are well-known\
        \ authoresses.1 Tile successful movement for gathering a church in this precinct\
        \ dates from May 12, 1780. We learn from the records of the First Church of\
        \ Cambridge that, \" At a meeting of the Brethren of the First Church in Cambridge,\
        \ under the above date, a petition from the Brethren and Sisters on the south\
        \ side of the River signifying their desire to be dismissed and recommended\
        \ to the business of being incorporated into a distinct church for enjoying\
        \ the special Ordinances of the Gospel more conveniently by themselves,\"\
        \ was considered. In a most friendly spirit the church, by vote, assented\
        \ to the dismissal of the petitioners, whose Dr. Foster was one of the board\
        \ of overseers of Harvard University ; was a member of various literary, benevolent,\
        \ and religious societies; and has left between twenty and thirty published\
        \ discourses. He was a well-read scholar, of most kindly dispo sition, fond\
        \ of anecdote, a good talker, and dwelt more on the practical than on the\
        \ theological side of religion. Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes has ad- 1 Mrs. Foster\
        \ died at Montreal, April 17, 1840, at the age of eighty-one. The two daughters\

        \ army, which had been taken prisoners at Saratoga on the 17th of October,\
        \ and ordered to Cambridge to await transportation to Europe. The captive\
        \ soldiers, to the number of several thousands, en tered Cambridge by the\
        \ Watertown road early in November, ami a forlorn spectacle they presented,\
        \ both British and Hessians. General Burgoyne was quartered in the Apthorp\
        \ \" palace,\" and Gen eral Riedesel in the Sewall house, and application\
        \ was made by General Heath for the college build ings for the rank and file.\
        \ Indeed, the application was reinforced by an order to clear the buildings\
        \ for that purpose ; but happily the execution of this plan was averted, and\
        \ the \" troops of the Conven tion,\" as the prisoners were rather euphoniously\
        \ styled, were provided for in barracks. The cap tured artillery was parked\
        \ on the Common, and for another year Cambridge wras alive with the scenes\
        \ of an extraordinary military life. The pres ence of so large a body of foreign\
        \ troops, enemies, demoralized and idle, had unfortunate effects upon both\
        \ the college and the town, notwithstanding the strict discipline wdiich it\
        \ was attempted to enforce. Friction was constant, quarrels were frequent,\
        \ and vice and disorder abounded. Some peculiarly unhappy incidents occurred,\
        \ and it was a day of general thankfulness when, in November, 1778, the last\
        \ of the captive troops took their departure. in Roxbury and Charlestown,\
        \ was intended by General Washington as a cover for a movement to occupy Dorchester\
        \ Heights, which was successfully accomplished on the night of the 4th. For\
        \ the moment a sortie and attack by the British were confidently expected,\
        \ and four thousand picked men were on parade at Cambridge to meet the emer\
        \ gency. But circumstances interfered, and the evacuation of Boston followed\
        \ instead. On the 17th, as the British moved out, the whole Ameri can camp\
        \ was on foot to move in, and by the 20th the town was once more in rightful\
        \ possession. The military days of Cambridge were ended. Washington left for\
        \ New York on the 4th of April, but it was reserved to Cambridge to have one\
        \ more visit from him. This was in 1789, when he spent about an hour at his\
        \ old quar ters, and received a salute from the militia on the Common. XIII.\
        \ COLLEGE RECOVERY AND GROWTH. 1776-1836. As has been already intimated, the\
        \ college was a principal sufferer by the military occupation of Cambridge,\
        \ and its slow recovery from the damages of war, and accompanying growth into\
        \ an advanced strength and inliueuce, may be regarded as giving shape to Cambridge\
        \ history in the period imme diately succeeding the Revolution. The patriotism\
        \ of neither students nor government had been want ing from the outset. As\
        \ early as 1768 the Senior class had voted to take its degrees in \" the manu\
        \ factures of this country,\" and at the Commence ment that year the class\
        \ appeared dressed accord ingly. On the 3d of April, 1776, the day before\
        \ General Washington's departure, he was honored with the degree of Doctor\
        \ of Laws, conferred by a unanimous vote of the corporation and overseers\
        \ sitting at Watertown. Later in the same month the governors and instructors\
        \ were required to make a satisfactory declaration to the overseers of their\
        \ political principles. By May the students quartered at Concord were clamorous\
        \ for a return to Cambridge, and this was permitted in June. More than a year\
        \ had elapsed since the college buildings had been given up to military occupa\
        \ tion. More than a year was yet to elapse before the material injury to the\
        \ buildings was to be repaired. That injury was estimated at nearly \xA3450.\
        \ About 1771 the alphabetical arrangement of students' names was adopted in\
        \ place of the un republican arrangement by social rank which had been previously\
        \ followed. The college officers at this time were a president, three professors,\
        \ four tutors, a treasurer, and a librarian ; the former receiving nominally\
        \ a salary of \xA3300, each of the professors one of \xA3200, the treasurer\
        \ \xA380, and the librarian \xA360. The derangement of the public currency\
        \ by the war made great havoc with the college funds, the repair of wdiich\
        \ was the occasion of long-continued and varyingly successful nego tiations\
        \ with the General Court. The time was one of great natural trial to the financial\
        \ condi tion of the College, and the embarrassment was enhanced by the culpable\
        \ and obstinate course of the treasurer, John Hancock, who from 1773 till\
        \ 1793 abused his office by neglect and contempt of its duties and responsibilities,\
        \ to the great incon venience of the college and his own disgrace. It was\
        \ not until two years after his death that the college succeeded in obtaining\
        \ from his estate its own. In the autumn of 1777 the peace of the college",

    - ["HISTORY OF STEPHENSON CUUNTY. 427 YOUNG .MEN'S LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. The origin\
        \ of this association is said to be due to a religious revival held in the\
        \ city of Freeport during the winter of 1874-75. At one of the revival meetings,\
        \ complaint was made that there was no place in town open to young men in\
        \ the evenings, and a discussion resulted as to the means that would enable\
        \ its absence to be supplied. After some preliminary canvass of the sub ject,\
        \ it was decided to establish a library. A number of young men combined for\
        \ that purpose, subscribed $10 each and rented and furnished a room for the\
        \ purpose. When the scheme had gotten well under way, the Rev. Robert Coll\
        \ yer delivered his lecture on \" Clear Grit \" to further the undertaking.\
        \ With the proceeds of Mr. C.'s contribution and $75 subscribed by citizens\
        \ of Free port, books were purchased, a room fitted up for their reception\
        \ and the library formally opened on New Year's Day, 1875. During that year,\
        \ the Hon. W. B. Fairfield (since deceased) and the Rev. E. E. Hall gave readings\
        \ for the benefit of the venture, upon which $40 were realized, and Mr. Pells\
        \ Manny donated $500. These sums are to day represented by the substantially\
        \ bound copies of standard works, including Irving, Hawthorne, Thackeray,\
        \ Scott, Dickens, George Eliot. DeQuincey, Goethe, Schiller and others, forming\
        \ a library unto themselves. The first year's experience was not so filled\
        \ with encouragement as to cause the management to clap its individual hands\
        \ with joy. It was not as generously patronized as its merits deserved ; many\
        \ of the young men who had given their, efforts to the support of the enterprise\
        \ removed from Freeport ; the current expenses were in excess of the income\
        \ ; subscriptions were falling off, and a variety of causes combined against\
        \ the library with such effect as to nearly accomplish its permanent retirement\
        \ from active service. At this junc ture, a number of gentlemen came to the\
        \ relief of the managers, and, increasing the associate membership, postponed\
        \ its demise, and, by their continued efforts in that behalf, prevented the\
        \ occurrence of this calamity in the future. During 1879, the library was\
        \ permitted a local habitation in the office of Oscar Taylor, rent free, and\
        \ a high degree of success attended the efforts made to secure subscribers.\
        \ In 1880, a move was made to the third floor of Mc- Namara's building, on\
        \ Stephenson street, adjoining the opera house, where apartments were furnished\
        \ particularly adapted to a library and reading room. The occupation of these\
        \ premises is still maintained, and the \" Freeport Library,\" which began\
        \ in the most limited and unpretentious manner possible to be im agined, has\
        \ grown in prominence, resources and influence. The present officers, are\
        \ : S. D. Atkins, President ; J. B. Taylor, Treas urer; Charles D. Knowlton,\
        \ Secretary, and W. L. Taylor, Librarian. The catalogue contains a total of\
        \ 850 volumes, exclusive of the magazines, exchanges and periodicals, to which\
        \ access can be obtained for a nominal con sideration, and the value of the\
        \ property held by the association cannot be far from $2,000. BANKS. The First\
        \ National Bank \u2014 Was duly organized February 24, 1864, with a capital\
        \ stock of ,$50,000, and the following officers : George F. De Forest, President,\

        \ E. Mayer, George F. De Forest and L. F. Burrell, Board of Directors. On\
        \ the 10th of March, 1865, the capital was increased to $100,000, which it\
        \ is to-day, with a surplus of $25,000.", 1]

        In 1734, the same year that his wife embarked for Russia, he procured himself
        to be admitted a fellow-commoner of Trinity College, Cam bridge, and it was
        afterwards imputed to him that his sole object in doing this was that he might
        steal what books and prints he could out of Trinity College Library, and every
        other college library he could get access to. In the following year a suspicion
        fell upon him that he had pillaged the Temple Library ; and this led the librarian
        of Trinity College and other members of the University who entertained a similar
        suspicion as to his proceedings at Cambridge to proceed to London, and having
        obtained a judge''s search-warrant they entered his chambers, and found there
        a great number of their best books, some curious ones cut out of others with
        yvhich they had been bound. They caused him to be appre hended, and he yvas
        committed to prison upon a charge of stealing books out of the library of
        Trinity College, Cam bridge. After enduring six months'' imprisonment before
        trial he was arraigned at the Old Bailey before Lord Hard wicke, Mr. Justice
        Comyns, and Mr. Justice Denton. With the astuteness of a lawyer, he pleaded
        that being a scholar and member of Trinity College and of the University he
        had a property in the books, and yvas entitled to borrow them, and could not
        be guilty of feloniously taking them. After several hours'' debate this plea
        was disallowed. He was con victed of the felony and sentence of transportation
        passed upon him. When he yvas put to the bar to receive sentence he implored
        the Court that he might be burnt in the hand and not sent abroad, yvhich would
        deprive him of the power of taking care of his young family, and of settling
        the affairs of his clients ; yvould also prevent his making restitution to
        the University, as he had numbers of books belonging to them, some in the
        hands of friends and some yvhich he had sent to Holland and elsewhere. But

        \ capped the climax by appointing him one of the party to shoot the Blue Ribbon\
        \ Cover. When Endymion, sitting in his little room, analyzed his feelings,\
        \ he came to the conclusion that his sadness was occasioned by his having\
        \ to part from Imogene. It often requires an event in life, and an unexpected\
        \ one, to make us clearly aware of the existence of feelings which have long\
        \ influenced us. Never having been in a position in which the possibility\
        \ of uniting his fate to an other could cross his mind for a moment, he had\
        \ been content with the good-fortune which per mitted a large portion of his\
        \ life to be passed in the society of a woman who, unconsciously both to him\
        \ and to herself, had fascinated him. The graceful child who, four or five\
        \ years ago, had first lit him to his garret, without losing anything of her\
        \ rare and simple ingenuousness, had devel oped into a beautiful and accomplished\
        \ woman. There vvas a strong resemblance between Imo gene and her sister,\
        \ but Imogene was a brunette. Her countenance indicated far more intellect\
        \ and character than that of Sylvia. Her brow vvas delicately pencilled and\
        \ finely arched, and her large dark eyes gleamed with a softness and sweetness\
        \ of expression which were irresistibly attractive, and seemed to indicate\
        \ sympathy with everything that vvas good and beautiful. Her features were\
        \ not so regular as her sister's ; but when she smiled, her face was captivating.\
        \ Endymion had often listened, half with fond ness and half with scepticism,\
        \ to Waldershare dilating, according to his wont, on the high char acter and\
        \ qualities of Imogene, whom he persist ed in believing he vvas preparing\
        \ for a great career. \" How it will come about I cannot say,\" he would remark;\
        \ \"but it will come. If my legitimate sovereign were on the throne, and I\
        \ in the possession of my estates, which were gra ciously presented by the\
        \ usurper to the sausage makers, or some other choice middle-class corpo ration,\
        \ I would marry her myself. But that is impossible. That would only be asking\
        \ her to share my ruin. I want her to live in palaces, and perhaps, in my\
        \ decline of life, make me her librarian, like Casanova. I should be content\
        \ to dine in her hall every day beneath the salt, and see her enter with her\
        \ state, amid the flourish of trumpets. \" And now, strange to say, Endymion\
        \ was speculating on the fate of Imogene, and, as he thought, in a more practical\
        \ spirit. Six hun dred a year, he thought, was not a very large in come ;\
        \ but it was an income, and one which a year ago he never contemplated possessing\
        \ until getting gray in the public service. Why not realize perfect happiness\
        \ at once ? He could conceive no bliss greater than living with Imo gene in\
        \ one of those little villas, even if semi-de tached, which now are numbered\
        \ by tens of thou sands, and which were then beginning to shoot out their\
        \ suburban antenna, in every direction of our huge metropolis. He saw her\
        \ in his mind's eye in a garden of perpetual sunshine, breathing of mignonette\
        \ and bright with roses, and waiting for him as he came down from town and\
        \ his daily labors, in the cheap and convenient omnibus. What a delightful\
        \ companion to welcome him! How much to tell her, and how much to listen to!\
        \ And then their evenings with a delicious book or some delightful music !\
        \ What holidays, too,of romantic adventure ! The vine-clad Rhine, perhaps\
        \ Switzerland ; at any rate, the quaint old cities of Flanders, and the winding\
        \ valley of the Meuse. They could live extremely well on six hundred a year\
        \ ; yes, with all the real refinements of existence. And all this genuine\
        \ happiness was to be sacrificed for utterly fantastic and imagi nary gratifications,\
        \ which, if analyzed, would be found only to be efforts to amuse and astonish\
        \ others. Mr. Rodney and Sylvia were at Conington on a visit to Lord Beaumaris,\
        \ hunting. It vvas as tonishing how Sylvia had ridden to the hounds, mounted\
        \ on the choicest steeds, and in a scarlet habit which had been presented\
        \ to her by Mr. Vigo. She had created quite an enthusiasm in the field, and\
        \ Lord Beaumaris vvas proud of his guests. When Endymion parted with his sister\
        \ at the Albany, where they had been examining his rooms, he had repaired\
        \ to Warwick Street, with some expectation that the Rodneys would have returned\
        \ from Conington, and he intended to break to his host the impending change\
        \ in his life. The Rodneys, however, had not arrived, and so he ascended to\
        \ his room, where he had been employed in arranging his books and papers,\
        \ and in indulging in the reverie which we have indicated. When he came down\
        \ stairs, wishing to inquire about the probable arrival of his land lord,\
        \ Endymion knocked at the door of the par lor where they used to assemble,\
        \ and on enter ing, found Imogene writing. \" How do you do, Mr. Ferrars ?\"\
        \ she said, ris ing. \"I am writing to Sylvia. They are not returning as soon\
        \ as they intended, and I am to go down to Conington by an early train to-mor\
        \ row.\" Mr. Wilton had invited Endymion to Gaydene, and as his stay there\
        \ could only be brief, had even invited him to repeat the visit. He was, indeed,\
        \ unaffectedly kind to one whom he re membered so young, and was evidently\
        \ pleased with him. One evening, a day or two before the break-up of the party,\
        \ while some charming Misses Play fellow, with an impudent brother, who all\
        \ lived in the neighborhood, were acting charades, Mr. Wilton said to Lady\
        \ Roehampton, by whose side he was sitting in the circle \u2014 \"I have had\
        \ a very busy morning about my office. There is to be a complete revolution\
        \ in it. The whole system is to be reconstructed ; half the present people\
        \ are to be pensioned off, and new blood is to be introduced. It struck me\
        \ that this might be an opening for your broth er. He is in the public service\
        \ \u2014 that is some thing ; and as there are to be so many new men, there\
        \ will be no jealousy as to his promotion. If you will speak to him about\
        \ it, and he likes it, I will appoint him one of the new clerks ; and then,\
        \ if he also likes it, he shall be my private secretary. That will give him\
        \ position, and be no mean addition to his income, you know, if we last but\
        \ that depends, I suppose, on Mr. Jorrocks.\" Lady Roehampton communicated\
        \ all this to her brother on her return to London. \"It is exactly what I\
        \ wished,\" she said. \"I wanted you to be private secretary to a cabinet\
        \ minister, and if I were to chose any one, except, of course, my lord, it\
        \ would be Mr. Wilton. He is a per fect gentleman, and was dear papa's friend.\
        \ I understand you will have three hundred a year to begin with, and the same\
        \ amount as his secre tary. You ought to be able to live with ease and propriety\
        \ on six hundred a year \u2014 and this re minds me of what I have been thinking\
        \ of before we went to Gaydene. I think now you ought to have a more becoming\
        \ residence. The Rodneys are good people, I do not doubt, and I dare say we\
        \ shall have an opportunity of proving our sense of their services ; but they\
        \ are not exactly the people that I care for you to live with, and, at any\
        \ rate, you cannot reside any longer in a gar ret. I have taken some chambers\
        \ in the Albany, therefore, for you, and they shall be my contribu tion to\
        \ your housekeeping. They are not badly furnished, but they belonged to an\
        \ old general officer, and are not very new-fashioned ; but we will go together\
        \ and see them to-morrow, and I dare say I shall soon be able to make them\
        \ comme il faut.\" \"I wanted to see Mr. Rodney,\" said Endymion moodily.\
        \ \" Can I write anything to him, or tell him any thing?\" said Imogene. \"\
        \ No,\" continued Endymion, in a melancholy tone. \"I can tell you what I\
        \ wanted to say. But you must be occupied now, going away, and unexpectedly,\
        \ to-morrow. It seems to me that every one is going away.\" \"Well, we have\
        \ lost the prince, certainly,\" said Imogene, \"and I doubt whether his rooms\
        \ will be ever let again.\" \"Indeed!\" said Endymion. \" Well, I only know\
        \ what Mr. Waldershare tells me. He says that Mr. Rodney and Mr. Vigo have\
        \ made a great speculation, and gained a great deal of money; but Mr. Rodney\
        \ never speaks to me of such matters, nor indeed does Sylvia. I am myself\
        \ veiy sorry that the prince has gone, for he interested me much.\" \" Well,\
        \ I should think Mr. Rodney would not bo very sorry to get rid of me then,\"\
        \ said Endym ion. \"Oh! Mr. Ferrars, why should you say or think such things?\
        \ I am sure that my brother and sister, and indeed every one in this house,\
        \ always considered your comfort and welfare be fore any other object.\" \"\
        Yes,\" said Endymion, \"you have all been most kind to me, and that makes\
        \ me more wretched at the prospect of leaving you.\" \" But there is no prospect\
        \ of that?\" \"A certainty, Imogene; there is going to be a change in my life,\"\
        \ and then he told her all. \"Well,\" said Imogene, \" it would be selfish\
        \ not to be happy at what I hear ; but though I hope I am happy, I need not\
        \ be joyful. I never used to be nervous, but I am afraid I am getting so.\
        \ All these great changes rather shake me. This adventure of the prince\u2014\
        \ as Mr. Waldershare says, it is histoiy. Then Miss Myra's great mar riage,\
        \ and your promotion \u2014 although they are exactly what we used to dream\
        \ about, and wished a fairy would accomplish, and somehow felt that, somehow\
        \ or other, they must happen \u2014 yet now they have occurred, one is almost\
        \ as astounded as delighted. We certainly have been very happy in Warwick\
        \ Street, at least I have been, all living as it were together. But where\
        \ shall we be this time next year? All scattered, and perhaps not even the\
        \ Rodneys under this roof. I know not how it is, but I dread leaving the roof\
        \ where one has been happy.\" \"Oh ! you know you must leave it one day or\
        \ other, Imogene. You are sure to many ; that you cannot avoid.\" \"Well,\
        \ I am not by any means sure about that,\" said Imogene. \" Mr. Waldershare,\
        \ in ed ucating me, as he says, as a princess, has made me really neither\
        \ fish, flesh, nor fowl, nor even that coarser but popular delicacy never\
        \ forgotten. I could not unite my life with a being who vvas not refined in\
        \ mind and in manners, and the men of my class in life, who are the only ones\
        \ after aU CHAPTER XLVIII. This considerable rise in the life of Endymion,\
        \ after the first excitement occasioned by its an nouncement to him had somewhat\
        \ subsided, was not contemplated by him with unmixed feelings of satisfaction.\
        \ It seemed to terminate many relations of life, the value of which he had\
        \ always appreciated, but which now, with their impend ing conclusion, he\
        \ felt, and felt keenly, had abso lutely contributed to his happiness. There\
        \ was no great pang in quitting his fellow-clerks, ex cept Trenchard, whom\
        \ he greatly esteemed. But poor little Warwick Street had been to him a real\
        \ home, if unvarying kindness, and sedulous atten tion, and the affection\
        \ of the eyes and heart, as well as of the mouth, can make a hearth. He hoped\
        \ he might preserve the friendship of Wal dershare, which their joint intimacy\
        \ with the prince would favor; but still he could hardly flatter himself that\
        \ the delightful familiarity of their past lives could subsist. Endymion sighed,\
        \ and then he sighed again. He felt sad. Be cause he vvas leaving the humble\
        \ harbor of ref uge, the entrance to which, even in the darkest hour of his\
        \ fallen fortunes, vvas thought some what of an indignity, and vvas about\
        \ to assume a position which would not have altogether misbe come the earliest\
        \ expectations of his life ? That seems unreasonable ; but mankind, fortunately,\
        \ are not always governed by reason, but by senti ment, and often by very\
        \ tender sentiment. It did not yet occur to Endymion that his gar den could\
        \ not always be sunshiny; that cares crop up in villas, even semi-detached,\
        \ as well as joys; that he would have children, and perhaps too many ; that\
        \ they would be sick, and that doctors' bills would soon put a stop to romantic\
        \ excursions ; that his wife would become exhaust ed with nursing and clothing\
        \ and teaching them ; that she herself would become an invalid, and moped\
        \ to death ; that his resources would every day bear a less proportion to\
        \ his expenditure ; and that, wanting money, he would return too of ten from\
        \ town a harassed husband to a jaded wife !", 1]

    - ['HISTORY OF THE STATE OF OHIO. 197 into these States. Its adoption was based
        upon certain specifications and limits of time, which upon a deeper consideration
        was deemed perplexing and impractical. An animated discussion arose not long
        since, regarding the correct author ship of this important ordinance, and
        its chief worker in gaining its sanction by Congress. Mr. Webster ascribed
        its authorship to Mathew Dane, of Massachusetts, which statement was immediately
        refuted by Mr. Benton, of Mississippi, who laid claim to it as the birthright
        of Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia. It has been almost impossible to obtain
        accurate reports of the actions of the old Continental Congress, from the
        fact that its meetings were held in secret, and any reports either narrated
        or shown in schedules or lists, were deemed a striking lack of trust on the
        part of the person who furnished the information. It was sufficient that its
        acts and conclusions be proclaimed without any prelude or reasoning process.
        Hence it has been difficult to obtain early Congressional documents. But it
        has been conclusively proven that the great motive power in gaining the approbation
        of the Ordinance of 1787, was neither Dane nor Jefferson, but Dr. Cutler.
        He arrived at New York, July 5 of that year, after a journey from Ipswich,
        Mass., in his sulky. He obtained lodgings at the " Plow and Harrow," and saw
        that his good horse was properly cared for and fed at the same place. Congress
        was then in session, and he had come on a mission for the Ohio Com pany, to
        negotiate their grant and its privileges in the new Territory of Ohio. He
        remained in New York three weeks, constantly engaged in the work vital to
        the interests of the future great State. But he secured the installment of
        the principles deemed the corner-stone of a future powerful State constitution.
        Mr. Poole, Librarian of the Chicago Public Library, searched assiduously for
        con clusive proof of Dr. Cutler''s right to this honor, and in the North American
        Review, Vol. 122, this is emphatically set forth with substantiating proof
        under his signature. Other facts have been discussed and proven at a very
        recent date, relative to the State of Ohio, which heretofore have been omitted,
        and nearly lost from the historic thread which unites the present with the
        past. The first settlement of the lands of the Northwest is necessarily surrounded
        with interest. But those were exciting, troublesome times, and a few links
        were passed over lightly. However, the years are not so far removed in the
        past but the line may be traced. Mr. Francis W. Miller, of Cincinnati, has
        supplied some missing chapters. The earliest documentary trace extant, regarding
        the southern settlement at Cincinnati, is an agreement of partnership between
        Denman, Filson and Pat terson, in the fractional section of land to which
        the city of Cincinnati was originally limited. It bears the date August 25,
        1788. This was entered on the records of Hamilton County, Ohio, October 6,
        1803.', 1]

        \ has been received from the fort since the 3d inst., and should the Indians\
        \ have been assisted by a British detachment, I fear it would not have been\
        \ able to hold \u25A0out. A small detachment which I sent to endeavor to penetrate\

    - ["THE BRIGHTON DIRECTORY FOR l8oO. 17 drinking : there were 41 victuallers,\
        \ innkeepers, &c. ; 5 brewers ; 3 wine and liquor merchants ; 2 porter, &c,\
        \ merchants, and one spruce beer brewer. There is one other trade in this\
        \ category which seems singularly restricted, \u2014 that of milkman. There\
        \ were 1,200 houses in the town, with some 7,000 inhabitants ; and yet there\
        \ was only one bond fide milkman ! Two other individuals, certainly, supplemented\
        \ other businesses by doing a milk-trade ; but how the trio contrived to supply\
        \ the wants of such a community, so that each one \" might have a little,\"\
        \ we do not venture to conjecture. It may, however, be stated that one lived\
        \ at the Unicorn Inn close to which was the time-honoured town-well ; the\
        \ other two in Brighton-place and Market street respectively, each being in\
        \ the neighbourhood of an old town-pump ! Knowing how largely the old town\
        \ was patronised by visitors, it is only natural to suppose that there would\
        \ be plenty of tradesmen to supply their wants in the matter of dress, &c.\
        \ For instance, the hair-dressers and perfumers are 17 in number; the tailors,\
        \ 16; haberdashers, drapers, &c, 15 ; mantua makers, dressmakers, milliners,\
        \ &c, 15 ; stay -makers, 2 ; glove and breeches makers, 2 ; calico-glazer,\
        \ 1 ; straw manufacturer, 1 ; and muslin manufacturer, 1. To this list might\
        \ be added 5 watchmakers, goldsmiths, &c. There were in the town 9 librarians,\
        \ music sellers, &c, 2 printers, and some 3 or 4 toymen. The building trade,\
        \ considering the rapid rate at which the town increased, was, doubtless,\
        \ a thriving one. No less than 21 master builders are down in the list; 6\
        \ plumbers, painters, and glaziers ; 9 cabinet makers, upholders, &c. ; two\
        \ ironmongers ; 2 blacksmiths ; 2 tinmen ; 3 stonemasons ; and 4 whitesmiths\
        \ and bell-hangers. In the furnishing way are 1 earthenware man ; 1 china\
        \ and glass man ; 2 cutlers ; 2 coopers ; and 1 basket maker. Three auctioneers\
        \ were ready to do duty for the community in the way of disposal of goods,\
        \ &c. ; but if a more quiet way were preferred, 1 broker and appraiser was\
        \ at their service, who might, if occasion arose, be supplemented by 1 porter.\
        \ The conveyance of visitors, &c, to and from the town, was, as might be supposed,\
        \ an important business. There were no less than 1 2 London coach-proprietors\

        \ chandlers ; 1 horse dealer ; 3 livery stable keepers ; 5 farriers ; 4 saddlers\

        \ \u2014 where, as a variation from out-door amusement, not a few of the early\
        \ visitors to Brighton were wont to spend their idle hours. The shops, which\
        \ were of small dimensions and contiguous to the Libraries, were, we are told,\
        \ the chief resort of \" fops, women, and children.\" They seem to have contained\
        \ as many varieties of merchandize as Autolycus's basket : toys of all descriptions;\
        \ rare china; lace and millinery, ribbons and muslins, \" chints and cambricks;\"\

        \ article of convenience, every trinket of luxury, was disposed of by this\
        \ uncertain, quick mode of transfer. There was not a shop without the indispensable\
        \ \"rattle-trap.\" The amount of business done must have been enormous; for\
        \ it was rattle, rattle, rattle, from \"morn to noon, from noon to dewy eve.\"\
        \ The Libraries \u2014 which after 1774 were kept open \" regularly all the\

        \ into the hallowed precincts of \" Society.\"! The Libraries, like the shops,\
        \ had their \" rattle-traps ;\" but though indispensable for carrying on business,\
        \ were regarded only as minor adjuncts to it. A somewhat higher and more exciting\

        \ in the cushions ! A Frenchman was also caught on the Steine carrying some\
        \ loaves, and, on his attempting to dispose of them at fancy prices, suspicion\
        \ was excited. When the loaves were opened by the revenue officers, they were\

        \ Numbers\" \u2014 \"names,\" rather than character or position in society,\
        \ being regarded as of primary importance. This rivalry induced a constant\
        \ struggle between the Librarians as to which should be the most courteous,\
        \ and the effects were those usually consequent upon opposition. Mr. Thomas\
        \ was from the first regarded as the \" fashionable book seller ;\" but Miss\

        \ Princess Amelia, the amiable and affectionate youngest daughter of George\
        \ III., paid her first visit to Brighton. She was then in her 15th year, and\
        \ is described \" as rather tall and very handsome ; and was dressed in a\
        \ light-coloured riding habit and a close cap tied under the chin with broad\
        \ lace.\" This estimable young lady had been staying at Worthing for some\
        \ months \u2014 a veritable martyr to that baneful hereditary disease of her\
        \ family and which subsequently hurried her to her tomb. The Prince of Wales\
        \ went more than once to see her whilst at Worthing ; and doubtless he spoke\
        \ of the Pavilion and the Steine, which gave rise to her wish to see Brighton,\
        \ though scarcely able to endure the journey. Her Royal Highness came in one\
        \ of His Majesty's coaches, drawn by four horses, and was accom panied by\
        \ Lady A. Cumberland and a gentleman. The Royal carriage, preceded by General\
        \ and Miss Goldsworthy in a curricle, and attended by General Cuyler on horseback,\
        \ was drawn very slowly round the Pavilion and Steine, up North-street and\
        \ down West-street, where it halted for a few minutes at the house of General\
        \ Cuyler, whose lady waited on the Princess at the carriage door and politely\
        \ invited Her Royal Highness to alight or to take some refreshment in the\
        \ coach, both which she with great affability declined, and, taking leave\
        \ of Mrs. Cuyler, proceeded with her retinue by the lower road on her return\
        \ to Worthing. In the first few years of the present century the Steine reached\
        \ its highest point as the resort of \" cornpany ; \" and, though frequented\
        \ by far greater numbers, in these years, it in many respects, resembled those\
        \ of 1790-93 \u2014 the previous most brilliant epoch in its history. Never\
        \ before had there been within its circumference such a throng of high-born,\
        \ and wealthy, and, more or less, distinguished visitors; and, day after day,\
        \ evening after evening, during the fashionable hours, it was all animation\u2014\
        \ all gaiety. In the autumn of 1802, though visitors had previously been \"\
        legion,\" the cry was, \"still they come;\" for, says a chronicler, the \"\
        attraction is irresistible, and the town was never known to be so full in\
        \ the middle of October ;\" and another states, \" the Steine was lively even\
        \ in November.\" This must surely have been the \" Golden Age \" of lodging-house\
        \ keeping in Brighton ! Over 100 houses had been built in the previous ten\
        \ years, yet \"accommodation\" was insufficient. In the next year or two,\
        \ the want was still felt ; in 1804, perhaps more so. So early as in May of\
        \ this latter year it was said, \" the Steine is increasing in gaiety and\
        \ fashion.\" In July, such was the desire to reach Brighton, that, they were\
        \ likely to get from Dick. He was full of anecdotes, and told them with a\
        \ gusto that kept the attention of the listener wide awake. Poor Dick ! We\
        \ believe that every soul that knew him liked him. He possessed some property\u2014\
        \ it has been said that he had claims to much more ; at any rate, when years\
        \ induced him to retire from a vocation he had long followed \u2014 librarian\
        \ \u2014 he had enough and to spare, and no man of late enjoyed his otium\
        \ more than Dick. It was quite joyous to see the capers he cut when above\
        \ eighty, to show that he was as agile as ever ; that he could play cricket,\
        \ of which he was very fond, as well as any boy ; and he would challenge any\
        \ man at halfhisage to run a mile. He had formed his reasoning for himself,\
        \ and all the eloquence or logic in the world had no effect whatever on Dick.\
        \ He knew every body that came to Brighton, and most of them, from the ' man\
        \ in green ' to Macnamara, knew him. He could teli numberless tales off-hand\
        \ about the American war, when he was a boy : about the first Revolution in\
        \ France, and how he had seen the priests who came over in a hurry and landed\
        \ in shoals at Newhaven. His laugh was a sort of crowing\u2014 so sharp, clear,\
        \ cheering, we doubt if he ever knew what the 'blues' are. He was never 'hipped'\
        \ an hour; but sunshine and smiles always dwelt on his small but handsome\
        \ features. He died in the 84th year of his age, and will always rank as one\
        \ of the characters of the town. Peace to his manes ! \"", 1]

        \ \u2014 that is, in their use by adults \u2014 was but of a few years' duration;\
        \ for in 1807 we learn that they were gradually getting into disuse, being\

        \ abandoned to the use of children; and has ever since performed its duty\
        \ as patiently as if its predecessors had never tasted the sweets of an exalted\
        \ position ! In concluding the notice of the Steine, we may briefly summarize\
        \ some of the more important changes which it underwent after 1800. Early\
        \ in the year 1806 it was improved by the addition of a spacious brick path\
        \ all round, within the rails, and for the better pre servation of the turf\
        \ in the centre a neat fence was put up, to prevent traffic over it in the\
        \ winter, by leaving only the intended circular walk and the bricked road\
        \ across open. The new fence was intended to be taken away during the summer\
        \ season, and replaced on the approach of every succeeding winter. The expense\
        \ of the undertaking was defrayed by voluntary subscription. In December,\
        \ 1805, the original Library, on the East side of the Steine, at the corner\
        \ of St. James's-street, built by Mr. Baker in 1760, was pulled down by Mr.\
        \ Donaldson, the then proprietor ; it being too dwarfish to admit of suitable\
        \ improvement by additions. The new edifice, of noble elevation and dimensions\
        \ (as we now see it, though the lower portion of it has since been much altered),\
        \ was opened in June, 1S06, the Prince of Wales graciously paying Mr. Donaldson\
        \ the compliment of appointing him bookseller and librarian to His Royal High\
        \ ness. In connection with the Libraries, it may be mentioned that raffling\
        \ was done away with after the passing of an Act of Parliament familiarly\
        \ known as Mr. Vansittart's \" Little-go Bill.\" This proved at first a sad\
        \ drawback to the profits of the Librarians, as the dice-box had been the\
        \ chief means of disposing of the multifarious kinds of ware which, in addition\
        \ to books, &c, they were accustomed to keep. To remedy the deficiency, trinket\
        \ auctions were had recourse to ; the \" Auction Lounge \" becoming associated\
        \ with the Library ; and of an evening, when the respective Librarians practised\
        \ \" knock-down-blows \" with their \" magnetic hammers,\" there were crowded\
        \ assemblages of the beau monde. One enterprising Librarian, Mr. Wilks (some\
        \ time associated with Mr. Donaldson) had a \" Pic-nic Auction \" on the Steine\
        \ itself, which, we are told, \" exhibited a blaze of rank and beauty.\" The\
        \ novelty, however, of these trinket auctions soon wore off; and the Librarians\
        \ disposed of their wares in the ordinary way. To provide a sub stitute for\
        \ raffling, \"Pam,\" or \"Loo,\" was revived, and, being supplemented by \"\
        lively and enchanting music, vocal and instrumental,\" it maintained its attractive\
        \ influence for some years more. The position of \" Loo,\" as a fashionable\
        \ pastime, was, however, rudely assailed in 1810, by an attempt being made\
        \ to constitute it an illegal game. For that purpose, information was", 5]

        \ out that the Magistrates really had no jurisdiction in the matter, the case\
        \ was dismissed ; and the Librarians returned home rejoicing, and \"Pam\"\
        \ was, for the time, more popular than ever. The general characteristics of\
        \ the Steine at this period (about 1807-8) would seem scarcely recognizable\
        \ to a modern Brightonian, though there were some general points of correspond\
        \ ence. The Steine was unquestionably then the prettiest part of Brighton\
        \ ; and very picturesque, with the sea in front : the Marine-parade (with\
        \ gaps at intervals) stretching eastward, with wooden posts and rails running\
        \ along the broken edge of the cliff, itself often shelving down to the beach\
        \ ; while to the north, beyond the line of handsome houses skirting each side\
        \ the broad green-sward, a glimpse was obtainable of grand old Hollingbury-hill.\
        \ The Steine itself was of greater extent than now, especially to the south\
        \ and east. It was un divided, except by a foot-path across its centre, from\
        \ Castle-square to St. James's-street. It was, too, for the most part, skirted\
        \ by a foot-path ; and the only pieces of carriage-road in connection with\
        \ it were on the east and west sides, and to the south-east. If, therefore,\
        \ it were necessary to drive a vehicle from Castle-square to the \" Blue and\
        \ Buff\" houses (to the north of the Steine) it was necessary to proceed southward,\
        \ along the west side of the Steine, into Pool-valley ; round the back of\
        \ Steine-place (now occupied by the York Hotel), and across the south end\
        \ of the Steine (in front of Russell House) ; thence along the east side,\
        \ round the back of Donaldson's Library (now the Railway booking-office, &c.\
        \ ), and down St. James's-street, whence, passing along the east side of the\
        \ north part of the Steine, the destination was reached. A pretty circuit,\
        \ truly, to get from one place to another not fifty yards distant ! This inconvenience\
        \ was endured for nearly twenty years ; down, in fact, to the year 1826. The\
        \ delay, probably, arose from the desire of some of the townspeople to preserve\
        \ the Steine intact as a promenade. But this was no longer possible in the\
        \ face of modern requirements and the changes taking place on every hand.\
        \ The Steine was not now the only fashionable promenade ; for the sea-front\
        \ to the west was being opened up, and visitors could and did resort thither.\
        \ On the Steine itself a new order of things was apparent. In 1822-3 it had\
        \ been enclosed with iron fencing ; George IV. giving ,\xA3500 and the Town\
        \ Commissioners towards the improvement.* The York Hotel had supplanted Steine-place\
        \ ; \" The * The local fishermen strongly opposed this improvement. They had,\
        \ says a contemporary journal, \" from time immemorial enjoyed the privilege\
        \ of drying their nets on the Steine, and removing their boats thither in\
        \ tempestuous weather, paying for these privileges to the Lords of the Manor,\
        \ or their Reeve, a reeve, consisting of six mackerel for every boat, as often\
        \ as such boats, severally, had landed to the number of one hundred long tale,\
        \ six score and twelve, but not otherwise. The Commissioners contended that\
        \ this rent proved the fishermen to be but tenants at will. It was not proposed\
        \ to shut them out of the privilege of drying their nets on the Steine ; but\
        \ the aborigines demanded a gate in connection with the new fencing of sufficient\
        \ width to admit their boats in case of necessity. They further alleged there\
        \ existed a document, dating from the reign of Elizabeth, in which a grant\
        \ was made of the Steine to the fishers and to their heirs for ever. The existence\
        \ of the document was, however, regarded as apocryphal, especially as rent\
        \ had been regularly paid from time immemorial. The demand of the fishermen\
        \ not being complied with, they opposed the progress of the work, and dragged\
        \ two large boats on to the Steine, leaving them, one at the southern, and\
        \ the other at the western, boundary. The works were consequently suspended,\
        \ and a meeting was called at the Old Ship, at which Committees were appointed\
        \ to discuss the matter pro and con, their decision to be final. The opposition\

        \ the growth of Brighton, namely,\u2014 a statistical comparison between 1850\
        \ and 1870, of some of the trades, &c, of the town. Within the period named\
        \ the builders, &c, increased from 80 to 134; the architects and surveyors,\
        \ from 13 to 21; the painters, from 60 to 72; and the ironmongers, gasfitters,\
        \ &c, from 26 to 60. The number of stonemasons remained stationary ; whilst\
        \ the timber-merchants showed a decrease (almost the only trade which did\
        \ so) of 5. The furnishing and upholstery warehouses increased from 38 to\
        \ 53 ; the china and glass warehouses, from 10 to 23 ; the French polishers,\
        \ from 5 to 8 ; the trunkmakers, from 6 to 10; and the Tunbridge-ware, dressing-case,\
        \ &c, makers, from 14 to 46. The house-agents in 1850 numbered 42, an increase\
        \ in the 20 years of 15 ; the auctioneers, 28, an increase of 11 ; and the\
        \ brokers, 29, an increase also of 11. The increase between 1850 and 1870\
        \ in the number of those who comprised the local commissariat department,\
        \ &c, appears to have kept pace with the growth of the town. Thus, the butchers\
        \ increased nearly 50 per cent., from 100 to 142 ; the bakers and pastry-cooks,\
        \ from 124 to 185 ; the grocers, tea dealers, &c, from 108 to 215 ; the fruiterers\
        \ and greengrocers from 91 to 160; the fishmongers, from 15 to 27 ; and the\
        \ poulterers, from i4to 16. The hotels exactly doubled their number, increasing\
        \ from 16 to 32 ; the boarding-houses increased by 4, numbering 29; the coffee\
        \ and dining rooms increased from 14 to 33; and there were, in addition, 8\
        \ restaurants. The lodging-houses increased from 486 to 721. The brewers more\
        \ than doubled their number, increasing from 14 to 29 ; the wine and spirit\
        \ merchants increased from 32 to 60 ; the ale and porter agents from 6 to\
        \ 10; and the taverns and public-houses from 97 to 398 ! The ginger-beer and\
        \ soda-water trade was scarcely so progressive ; the manufacturers increasing\
        \ but 2 in the 20 years. The dairymen, too, were a very stationary class during\
        \ the double decade; in 1850, when the population was about 70,000, they numbered\
        \ 42 ; in 1870, when it was about 120,000, they numbered 43 ! We are unable\

        \ of the Rev. George E. Ellis, of Charles town, within whose parochial charge\

        \ universally beloved man, was a member of the school board, and at the time\
        \ of his death a trustee of the public library. Under these unpromising auspices\
        \ Somerville began her municipal existence. The first meeting, after the organization,\
        \ was held April 4, 1842, and the following appropriations were made : Support\
        \ of schools, $1,800; highways, $2,000; county tax, $450; poor, $200; contingencies,\
        \ $300; total appropriation, $4,750. The town was allowed one representative\

        & Ruhl, became, like Mrs. Toodles'' door-plate, a handy thing to have, not
        in the house, but on it, for it had never been taken down from the beginning
        of the partnership of Levering & Ruhl, in 1836. This copartnership continued
        six years, when Mr. Levering sold out to his partner, who still con tinues
        the business, but has moved from the old stand across the street. Van Buskirk,
        after selling out to Levering & Ruhl, started a store on his own account,
        but did not continue long, when he closed out and removed to Missouri. The
        next venture was a store, opened by a man whose name is now forgotten, but
        was conducted by one Hull. J. Rhinehartand Henry Sowers also had a store,
        but neither it nor the one carried on by Hull continued in existence very
        long. There is now but the one store (Buhl''s) in the place. The post office
        was established October 27,1843, and John Boner was the first Postmaster.
        The name of the post office was Woodview, a name it still bears, and Amos
        Ruhl is the Postmaster. The first tavern in North Woodbury was kept by Richard
        Sherley. A Mr. Paxton was also an early tavern-keeper, as well as a man named
        Will iam Kreps, and one Acton. George Kepper was the first shoemaker ; Adam
        Beehtel was the first tailor ; Adam Hoffner, the first wagon-maker ; Peter
        Burkeybite was the first blacksmith. As stated above, Terry & Cornwall were
        hatters, and manufactured these handy "implements" from wool. It was an extensive
        business in those days, when people made everything they wore, instead of
        buying it. Timothy Sherley was the first cooper. The first schoolhouse in
        the village was of logs, and was built about 1832. Among the first teachers,
        were Dr. Floyd, and a man named Spears. A handsome schoolhouse now ornaments
        the town. The first cemetery was laid out by George B. Hosier, and Elizabeth
        Ruhl was the first person buried in it. A lanyard was an early institution
        of Woodbury, and was kept by Peter Rauhauser. A distillery was kept by one
        Hilderbrand, but did not last long. North Wood bury was once a lively town,
        and did a large busi ness, but, like Johnsville, a lack of railroads cost
        it the most of its trade. A carriage factory here at one time did a thriving
        business. Among the doctors who have practiced their profession in the village,
        are Drs. Rundall, Hull, Main and Ruhl, the latter a practitioner at present.
        The Albrights organized a church here between 1830 and 1835. Among its early
        members were Adam Lucas, Samuel Dennis, Michael and George Rhinehart, and
        their families. One of the early preachers was Rev. Mr. Baumgarten. Rev. Mr.
        Leiter also preached occasionally in the town. The first church edifice was
        built about 1838, and was a large frame. When it became old and well worn,
        the society bought the church building of the United Brethren, who had, in
        the mean time, formed a society and erected a church. Their society, some
        of the original members of whom were John Wibling, Adam Bechtel, George Nickey,
        Samuel Miller and Joseph Klinefelter, growing weak from deathand removals,
        they sold their building to the Albrights, as we have said, and who still
        occupy it, after thoroughly re pairing it. The present Pastor is Rev. Mr.
        Bowen. A good Sunday school is maintained, of which, we believe, Dr. Davis,
        of Johnsville, is Superintendent. Mr. Dennis, one of the original members
        of this church, lived to be over ninety years of age, and Mr. Lucas is still
        living, though a member at present of the Luth eran Church. North Woodbury
        once had quite a nice little library, which was established in 1841. Any one
        could become a member upon the payment of $2, and signing the constitution.
        The officers were a President, Vice President, three Managers, a Librarian
        and Treasurer. The old record books are before us, and the names signed to
        the Con stitution, which is transcribed in them, recall many of the pioneers
        of the village and the town ship. The library was long a source of interest
        to the town, but was finally allowed to go down. The', 1]

        \ deputy Governor of Maine and mayor of Gorgeana, was granted by Sir Ferdinando\
        \ Gorges, in 1641, 5000 acres of land, which he was permitted to select for\
        \ a barony, with full power to divide the same into manors and lordships,\
        \ and to hold courts-baron and court-leets within said lordship. He chose\
        \ the tract near the Ogun quit, in the southwestern part of the present town\
        \ of Wells. On the 19th of April, 1643, Gorges conveyed a part to Rev. John\
        \ Wheelwright, who had been banished from Massachusetts on account of his\
        \ antinomian principles. Mr. Wheelwright was a leading man in the early civil\
        \ affairs of the province. (See General History.) He was the father of John\

        \ No schools existed in the town prior to 1715, nor does it appear that the\
        \ town till this date voted to employ a schoolmaster. The Indian wars had\
        \ been a serious imped iment to education. It does not appear that the first\
        \ vote of the town was carried into effect, for in 1716 the town was indicted\
        \ for not procuring a schoolmaster. This led to the employment of the first\
        \ teacher,\u2014 Mr. Richard Martin, the son of a former minister. He was\
        \ a graduate of Har vard in 1680. In 1717 the town voted \xA330 to Mr. Martin\
        \ for his year's services, \" to teach girls and boys to read, write, and\
        \ sifer, or Latin, according to their capacity ;\" school to be kept the first\
        \ quarter at Col. John Wheel wright's house ; the second quarter at Mr. Daniel\
        \ Little field's house, near Ogunquit River ; the remaining half-year near\
        \ the meeting-house, in the middle of the town. \" The persons with whom Mr.\
        \ Martin diates to be paid 6s. per week during the term of time exprest.\"\
        \ Besides these whom we have mentioned as distinguished in the wars of the\
        \ country, Wells can boast of its full share of eminent men in the other departments\
        \ of life. Joseph Hammond and John Wheelwright were councilors of the province,\
        \ and judges of the Courts of Common Pleas and of Probate. Samuel Wheelwright\
        \ was judge of the Court of Common Pleas and Probate. John Storer was judge\
        \ of the Court of Common Pleas, and engaged in various ways in the service\
        \ of the government. Joseph Sayer, a judge of the Common Pleas ; Nathaniel\
        \ Wells, many years a judge of said court, commissioner on eastern land, and\
        \ in many matters agent in the public service. Rev. Dr. Hem menway was one\
        \ of the most eminent theologians of New England. Col. John Wheelwright was\
        \ town clerk forty years, and one of the selectmen. He was judge of the Court\
        \ of Common Pleas, judge of Probate, and one of the councilors of the province\
        \ for many years. He was in the service as an officer under Mayor Converse,\
        \ went on the eastern expedition, and was afterwards stationed at Fort Mary,\
        \ near the mouth of the Saco River. Government relied upon him with great\
        \ confidence. He died Aug. 13, 1745, aged eighty-one years. Schools went on\
        \ prosperously from this time. In 1734 it was voted to build two school-houses\
        \ in town, one \" on the ministerial lot, and the other near Deacon Samuel\
        \ Treadwell's, each of one story, and 22 feet by 16.\" Among those who taught\
        \ in town from 1728 to the Revolution were Nathaniel Harrington (graduate\
        \ of Har vard), Andrew Tyler (Harvard, 1738), John Lester, Eben ezer P. Kingman,\
        \ Robert Swainson, Master Morse, John Cluff, John Heard (Harvard), Nathaniel\
        \ Adams (Harvard), John Denine, Samuel Prentiss, John Coffin, Daniel F. Ayer,\
        \ Daniel Rogers (graduate), Edmund Webber, Nathaniel Libby, Master Haile,\
        \ Samuel Hancock. Those who were graduates taught the grammar schools. After\
        \ the Revo lution Jonathan Ward. Robert Harvey, James Snow, and James Osborn\
        \ were employed as teachers. CHURCHES. FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH OP WELLS.\
        \ Previous to the formal gathering of a church the people had been provided\
        \ with preaching by the town, as the law required. The celebrated John Wheelwright\
        \ probably was one of the first ministers. July 1, 1661, the court at York\
        \ appointed Ezekiel Knight and Wm. Hammond \" to conduct worship at Wells\
        \ on the Lord's day, as the law of God and this jurisdiction require.\" This\
        \ order prevailed about two years, when the people hired their own minister\
        \ at a stipu lated salary, so long as they saw fit to remain. Six minis ters,\
        \ or religious teachers, were thus employed from 1664 to 1690. Accordingly,\
        \ in 1664, Joseph Emerson was set tled for two or three years; in 1667, Jeremiah\
        \ Hubbard for a few months ; soon after, Robert Payne, probably five years.\
        \ A house was built for him on the town lot, and he had a salary of \xA345.\

        P. Fortin''s pamphlet containing the speech referred to above : " The Basque
        fishermen, who lived on and frequented the Bay of Biscay, for whale fishing,
        because that sea was full of these mammiferous animals, were attracted in
        pursuit of schools of whales to the middle of the Atlantic, and even to the
        Banks of Newfoundland, where the whale were more abundant, because, on these
        banks and banks similarly situated, the mollusca and Crustacea and small fish,
        which served as their food, were found in abundance, so that the opinion,
        that rests on good foundation, obtains that the Basque fishermen discovered
        the Banks of Newfoundland, and probably Newfoundland itself, before Columbus
        discovered America ; and this led to the exis tence of a fishing industry,
        carried on by fishermen from Biscay, Spain, and Brittany, France, of which
        we, nowadays, can have no idea, as, if certain historical records are to be
        believed, these fishermen, and the merchants who traded with them, kept their
        operations as secret as possible " The prosecution of the fisheries is of
        much older date than is generally credited. In the account of his first voyage
        to the Saint-Lawrence Jacques Cartier does not pretend to have discovered
        the Gulf of St. Lawrence nor the coast of Labrador, but says he had met a

        aid in accomplishing than the writer of these " Historical Sketches of Andover."
        I desire to thank the various librarians of historical and genea logical societies
        and the custodians of records and archives, who have courteously rendered
        me assistance. To mention their names would be less to honor them than to
        adorn these pages. To the scholars and literary critics who took pains to
        examine the manuscript and who gave the influence of their opinion in the
        prospectus, I am under great obligation, which to repeat their names here
        would be to heighten. To the subscribers, whose generous gifts have secured
        the pub lication and illustration of the book, I am deeply indebted, espe
        cially to the gentlemen who in addition to their large subscription assumed
        the chief part of the pecuniary responsibility. To the scientific scholar
        who kindly prepared the geological in troduction, not only the writer but
        the readers of these Sketches owe gratitude. His name is so well known that
        it does not need mention to friends of Andover, who will readily recognize
        the ini tials at the close of the chapter. It is unnecessary to rehearse here
        the names of authors and the works consulted in the preparation of the book,
        yet thanks are due to the families and individuals who have intrusted me with
        valuable private papers. In regard to one or two points in the book a word
        may be added. Some repetitions of statement occur in regard to persons and
        events in the several chapters, for the reason that the subject matter is
        arranged topically rather than in the form of annals, and each chapter is
        intended to be sufficiently comprehensive to be in a measure independent of
        the other chapters. Many eminent names of Andover do not appear in these pages
        because the Sketches do not cover the departments of enterprise in which they
        were active, or the events in which they bore a conspicuous part. Some additional
        matter, and emendations and corrections, will be found in the Appendix. Following
        this are the names of the subscribers who secured the publication. S. L. B.

        \ of the First Church, Boston. He died after a year's pastorate, October 14,\

        \ entered into business or professions. The names are in the chronological\
        \ list at the end of this chapter. Thus we see that from the beginning Andover\
        \ furnished ministers for the important churches of New England. The ancient\
        \ parishes of Charlestown, Salem, Boston, found talent in this inland plantation\
        \ equal to the demands of city pulpits ; and the other venerable and influential\
        \ towns of the Common wealth, \u2014 Groton, Haverhill, Beverly, Medford,\

        \ from Andover, before the establishment of the Theological Seminary, ministers\
        \ whose names adorn their ecclesiastical annals. The contemporary pastors\
        \ in Andover, of the territorial parishes in the next half century were, in\
        \ the North Parish, Rev. Bailey Loring (1810-1850), in the South Parish, Rev.\
        \ Justin Edwards, D. D. (18 12-1827), Rev. Milton Badger (1828-1835), Rev.\
        \ Lorenzo L. Langstroth (1836\u2014 1839), Rev. John L. Taylor, D. D. (1839-1852)\
        \ ; in the West Par ish, its first minister, the Rev. Samuel C. Jackson, D.\

        \ of Andover, whose territorial lines of demarcation regulated the church\
        \ attendance and taxation of their resi dents. At the beginning, such attendance\
        \ and taxation within the prescribed limits were rigidly enforced. No per\
        \ sons could, without peril, assemble for worship anywhere ex cept in the\

        \ of the Parish for building the meeting House, and shall continue their union\
        \ and harmony with the Parish, as it subsisted before the measures taken by\
        \ them for building a meeting-house.\" At last, in 1826, a division was peaceably\
        \ effected and the parish lines defined and marked off. The West Parish in\
        \ cluded1 158 families: adults 544; children 326; inhabitants 870. The church\
        \ was organized in November, 1826. A meeting-house of granite was built, \u2014\
        \ the \" Stone Meeting- House.\" It is the oldest house of worship now standing\
        \ in the limits of ancient Andover (North and South), except the chapel of\
        \ the Theological Seminary, and is a substantial and really beautiful edifice\
        \ for a country parish. It was dedicated and a sermon preached by Dr. Edwards,\
        \ December 26, 1826. The first pastor of the West Parish, the Rev. Samuel\
        \ C. Jackson, D. D., was ordained June 6, 1827, being then twenty five yCars\
        \ old. He resigned his charge September 25, 1850, on account of infirm health,\
        \ which made pastoral duties too onerous. He then became Assistant Secretary\
        \ of the Massa chusetts Board of Education and acting State Librarian. Before\
        \ his formal dismissal from his parish he had entered (1849) on the duties\
        \ of these offices of the Commonwealth. He discharged them with marked ability\
        \ until within a short time before his death. This occurred July 26, 1878.\

        \ He had been invited (1839) to accept the presidency of the college. Before\
        \ Dr. Jackson decided to make the ministry his profession, he had spent two\
        \ years in the study of law. This legal study gave him a wider range of interest\

        him to pledge to the town the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, on condition
        that an equal sum should be subscribed by others, for the erection of a building
        and providing for a library. To this pledge Mr. Peter Smith and Mr. John Dove

        dollars as a memorial of his brother, Peter Smith Byers, first principal of
        the Punchard School ; Mr- Joseph W. Smith added one thousand dollars ; the

        has marble tablets, in memory of fifty-two soldiers of Andover. The library
        contains about seven thou sand volumes. The librarian is Mr. Ballard Holt.
        A public library was established at North Andover in 1875 by a donation of
        Gen. Eben Sutton. It has received aid from Messrs. Davis and Stone, and Hon.

        in any town or city in the world can make so favorable a showing. The reading
        room, which is separate from the library room, is liberally furnished with
        magazines aud other periodicals, by subscriptions and donations. By the last
        report March 1st 1880, there were on the tables twenty-nine quarterly and

        be added to the previous statement of the reading capacity of Concord people.
        From the commencement, the new library has been extremely fortunate in securing
        and retaining the services of a very effici ent librarian, Miss Whitney. Much
        credit is due to her for the interior arrangements and for the successful
        management of the library. The catalogue of books compiled by Miss Whit ney
        is a most admirable one. All the books are alphabetically arranged and classified
        under the names of authors, titles, and subjects, with manjr cross-references.
        The books are all classi fied, each subject, and each division of a subject
        being by itself. One alcove in the library is devoted exclusively to the books,
        pamphlets, etc., relating particularly to Concord. The reference department
        is a very important one. It in cludes many valuable books in all departments
        of learning. Its advantages are seen every day, not only in connection with
        general readers, but with scholars from the higher schools; words, technical
        terms, names, dates, and places in history,', 1]

        At this point is the field where in 1859 Gen. Banks held his famous muster
        of ten thousand militia. This large sandy tract known as the Cook farm was
        afterwards purchased by the State for the site of a prison to take the place
        of the one at Charlestown. Fine buildings have been erected, and in June 1878
        the convicts were established in their new quarters under the able wardenship
        of Gen. S. E. Chamberlain, who has a high record for bravery in the Mexican
        and Civil wars. From this establishment and the junction of the Fitchburg,

        "given power to his elect to tread upon adders and baselisks, and to trample
        upon lions and dragons ?" So he persevered with his request, and the legend
        says that, as soon as he had landed on the island with his companions, in
        the name of God he drove out all the snakes and vermin. Then with his forty
        brethren he proceeded to clear the dense jungle with which the island was
        covered, and to drain the swamps, so that in a short time, as the monkish
        chronicle tells, there was a pleasant and suitable place for human habitation,
        where formerly had only been "thickets and holes for monstrous lizards and
        snakes." It is delightful to think of the change accomplished by these resolute
        and God fearing men, but the exodus of the noxious and unclean beasts must
        be somewhat exaggerated in a crude paint ing in the abbey church. It represents
        the building of the monastery while the lake all around the island is being

        \ sedate looking old gentleman, who, although he has contrived to make very\
        \ rich in his business, has still the air of being somewhat dissatisfied that\
        \ so much more attention should be paid by his fellow-citizens to the flimsy\
        \ novelties of the day than to the solid and substantial articles which his\
        \ magazine displays. But his son is the chief enthusiast \u2014 indeed, he\
        \ is by far the most genuine specimen of the true old-fashioned biblio pole\
        \ that I ever saw exhibited in the person of a young man. My friend Wastle\
        \ (Lockhart) has a prodigious liking for him. Here Wastle commonly spends\
        \ one or two hours every week he is in Edin burgh, turning over, in the company\
        \ of his young friend, all the Aldines, Elzevirs, Wynkin de Wordes, and Caxtons,\
        \ in the collection, nor does he often leave the shop without taking some\
        \ little specimen of its treasures home with him. David Laing is still a very\
        \ young man, but Wastle tells me that he possesses a truly remarkable degree\
        \ of skill and knowledge in almost all departments of bibliography. Since\
        \ Lunn's death, he says, he does not think there is any of the booksellers\
        \ in London superior to him in this way. He publishes a catalogue almost every\
        \ year, and thus carries on a very extensive trade with all parts of the island.\
        \ I believe he has no rival in the whole country. This old gentleman and his\
        \ son are distinguished by their classical taste in regard to other things\
        \ besides books. They give an annual dinner to Wastle, and he carried me with\
        \ him the other day to one of these anniversaries. I have seldom seen a more\
        \ luxurious display. David and Wastle en tertained us with a variety of stories\

        \ long, useful, and studious career, and the mere enumeration of whose contributions\
        \ to Scottish history, antiquities, and literature, would form a long catalogue.\
        \ In No. 49 he was long in partnership with his father (whose shop had formerly\
        \ been at the Canongate-head, near St. Mary's Wynd), under the designation\
        \ of \"William and David Laing,\" in 1S26; but long before that period he\
        \ had become known to the frequenters of the shop as a young man possessing\
        \ an immense amount of bibliographic information. John Gibson Lockhart gives\
        \ us a descriptive account of the Laings' establishment, which no doubt was\
        \ a pleasant lounge for him and other literati of the day. In \" Peter's Letters\
        \ to his Kinsfolk \" he writes thus : \u2014 \"As for shops of old books,\
        \ classics, black- letter, foreign literature, and the like, I never was in\
        \ a great town which possesses so few of them as this. There is, however,\

        \ to be, in the immediate vicinity of the College, and consequently quite\
        \ out of the way of all fashionable promenades and lounges ; but, indeed,\
        \ for anything that I have seen, it is not frequented much by young gentlemen\
        \ of the Uni- versity. The daily visitors of Mr. Laing seem rather to be a\
        \ few scattered individuals of various classes and professions, among whom,\
        \ in spite of the prevailing spirit and customs of the place, some love of\
        \ classical learning is still found to linger \u2014 retired clergymen and\
        \ the like, who make no great noise in the world, and, indeed, are scarcely\
        \ known to exist by the most part, even by the literary people of Edinburgh\
        \ The shop, notwithstanding, is a remarkably neat and comfortable one, and\
        \ even a lady might lounge in it without having her eye offended or her gown\
        \ soiled. It consists of two apartments, which are both completely furnished\
        \ with valuable editions of old authors ; and I assure William Laing was the\

        \ and turbulent for some years, but it reached a climax on the 15th of September,\

        \ and declining to admit the masters or any one else, made preparation to\

        \ shut but barricaded and strongly guarded within ; all attempts to storm\
        \ the boy-garrison proved impracticable, and all efforts at reconciliation\
        \ were unavailing. The Town Council lost patience, and sent Bailie John Macmorran,\
        \ one of the wealthiest merchants in the city (though he had begun life as\
        \ a servant to the Regent Morton), with a posse of city officers, to enforce\

        \ outrageous, and mocked them as \" buttery carles,\" daring any one to approach\
        \ at his peril. \" To the point likely to be first attacked,\" says Steven,\

        \ original object of the institution \u2014 \"To procure an exten- sive collection\

        \ those days were usually named \"Lawnmarket Gazettes,\" in allusion to their\
        \ roguish or waggish originators. Adjoining it and stretching eastward is\
        \ the library of the Writers to the Signet. It is of Grecian archi tecture,\
        \ and possesses two long pillared halls of beautiful proportions, the upper\
        \ having Corinthian columns, and a dome wherein are painted the Muses. It\
        \ is 132 feet long by about 40 broad, and was used by George IV. as a drawing-room,\
        \ on the day of the royal banquet in the Parliament House. Formed by funds\
        \ drawn solely from con tributions by Writers to H. M. Signet, it is under\
        \ a body of curators. The library contains more than 60,000 volumes, and is\
        \ remarkably rich in British and Irish history. At all periods the Lawnmarket\
        \ was a residence for men of note, and the frequent residence of English and\
        \ other foreign ambassadors ; and so long as Edinburgh continued to be the\
        \ seat of the Parliament, its vicinity to the House made it a favourite and\
        \ convenient resort for the members of the Estates. Southward of it and lying\
        \ parallel with it, nearer the Cowgate, is the Advocates' Library, two long\
        \ halls, with oriel windows on the north side. This library, one of the five\
        \ in the United Kingdom en titled to a copy of every work printed in it, was\
        \ founded by Sir George Mackenzie, Dean of Faculty in 1682, and contains some\
        \ 200,000 volumes, forming the most valuable collection of the kind in Scotland.\
        \ The volumes of Scottish poetry alone exceed 400. Among some thousand MSS.\

        \ Napier as Librarian to the Signet Library ; and when the new and noble library\
        \ of the University was opened he volunteered to arrange it, which he did\
        \ with all the ardour of a bibliomaniac. He was made LL.D. of his native university\
        \ in 1864, and is believed to have edited and annotated fully 250 rare works\
        \ on Scottish history and antiquities. True to its old tradition, No. 49 is\
        \ still a book seller's shop, held by the old firm of Ogle and Murray. Each\
        \ piece bore, in addition to the castle and date letter, the assay-master's\
        \ initials. Seven alphabets of a different type have been exhausted in record\
        \ ing the dates ; and the letter of the eighth alphabet, for 1869, is an Egyptian\
        \ capital M. In 1759 the standard mark of a thistle was substituted for the\
        \ assay-master's initials, and is still continued. In 1784 a 'duty-mark' was\
        \ added, the form being the head of the sovereign. The silver mace of the\
        \ city of Edinburgh is dated 1617; the High Church plate, 1643.\" In No. 98\
        \ of the Bridge Street are the Assay Office and Goldsmith's Hall. The former\
        \ is open on alternate days, when articles of gold and silver that require\
        \ to be guaranteed by the stamp of genuineness, are sent in and assayed. The\
        \ assay master scrapes a small quantity of metal off each article, and submits\
        \ it to a test in order to ascertain the quality. The duty charged here on\
        \ each ounce of gold plate is 17s. 6d., and on silver plate is. 6d. The making\
        \ of spoons and forks was at one time an extensive branch of the silversmith\
        \ trade in Edinburgh ; but the profits were so small that it has now passed\
        \ almost entirely into the hands of English manufacturers. The erection of\
        \ this bridge led to the formation of Hunter's Square and Blair Street, much\
        \ about the same time and in immediate conjunction with it. The square and\
        \ street (where the King's printing office was placed) were both named from\
        \ Sir James Hunter Blair, who was Provost of the city when the bridge was\
        \ commenced, but whose death at Harrogate, in 1789, did not permit him to\
        \ see the final completion of it. One of the earliest incorporated trades\
        \ of Edin burgh was that of the hammermen, under which were included the goldsmiths,\
        \ who, in 1586, were formed into a separate company. By the articles of it,\
        \ apprentices must serve for a term of seven years, and masters are obliged\
        \ to serve a regular apprenticeship of three years or more to make them more\
        \ perfect in their trade. They were, moreover, once bound to give the deacon\
        \ of the craft sufficient proof of their knowledge of metals, and of their\
        \ skill in the working thereof. By a charter of James VI., all persons not\
        \ of the corpo ration are prohibited from exercising the trade of a goldsmith\
        \ within the liberties of Edinburgh. Number 4 in this small square, the north\
        \ side of which is entirely formed by the Tron Church, contains the old hall\
        \ of the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, which was formed in 1681. But long\
        \ previous to that year the merchants of the city formed themselves into a\
        \ corporation, called the guildry, from which, for many ages, the magistrates\
        \ were exclusively chosen ; and, by an Act of Parliament passed in the reign\
        \ of James III., each of the incorporated trades in Edinburgh was empowered\
        \ to choose one of their number to vote in the election of those who were\
        \ to govern the city, and this guildry was the parent of the Merchant Company.\
        \ \" It was amidst some of the most distressing things in our national history\
        \ \u2014 hangings of the poor ' hill folk ' in the Grass market, trying of\
        \ the patriot Argyle for taking the test-oath with an explanation, and so\
        \ forth\u2014 that this company came into being. Its nativity was further\
        \ heralded by sundry other things of a troublous kind affecting merchandise\
        \ and its practitioners.\" King James VII. incorporated the company by a charter,\
        \ with additional powers for the regulation of its trade. Those were granted,\
        \ so it runs, \" be cause the art and science of goldsmiths is exercised in\
        \ the city of Edinburgh, to which our subjects frequently resort, because\
        \ it is the seat of our supreme Parliament, and of the other supreme courts,\
        \ and there are few goldsmiths in other cities.\" In virtue of the powers\
        \ conferred upon it, the company, from the date of its formation, tested and\
        \ stamped all the plate and jewellery made in Scotland. The first stamp adopted\
        \ was the triple towered castle, or city arms. \"In 1681,\" says Bremner,\
        \ in his \"Industries of Scotland,\" \"a letter representing the date was\
        \ stamped on as well as the castle. The letter A indicates that the article\
        \ bearing it was made in the year between the 29th of September, 1681, and\
        \ the same day in 1682 ; the other letters of the alphabet, omitting j and\
        \ w, representing the succeeding twenty-three years. The merchants of Edinburgh,\
        \ according to Arnot, were erected into a body-corporate by royal charter,\
        \ dated 19th October, 1681, under the name of The Company of Merchants of\
        \ the City of Edinburgh. By this charter they were empowered to choose a Preses,\

        cross his mind for a mo ment, he had been content with the good fortune which
        per mitted a large portion of his life to be passed in the society of a woman
        who, unconsciously both to him and to herself, had fascinated him. The graceful
        child who, four or five years ago, had first lit him to his garret, without
        losing anything of her rare and simple ingenuousness, had developed into a
        beau tiful and accomplished woman. There was a strong resem blance between
        Imogene and her sister, but Imogene was a brunette. Her countenance indicated
        far more intellect and character than that of Sylvia. Her brow was delicately
        pen ciled and finely arched, and her large dark eyes gleamed with a softness
        and sweetness of expression, which were irresistibly attractive, and seemed
        to indicate sympathy with everything that was good and beautiful. Her features
        were not so regu lar as her sister''s ; but when she smiled, her face was
        capti vating. Endymion had often listened, half with fondness and half with
        skepticism, to Waldershare dilating, according to his wont, on the character
        and qualities of Imogene, whom he persisted in believing he was preparing
        for a great career. "How it will come about I can not say," he would remark
        ; " but it will come. If my legitimate sovereign were on the throne, and I
        in the possession of my estates, which were graciously presented by the usurper
        to the sausage-makers, or some other choice middle-class corporation, I would
        marry her myself. But that is impossible. That would only be asking her to
        share my ruin. I want her to live in palaces, and perhaps in my decline of
        life, make me her librarian, like Casanova. I should be content to dine in
        her hall every day beneath ''the salt, and see her enter with her state, amid
        the flourish of trumpets." And now, strange to say, Endymion was specu lating
        on the fate of Imogene, and, as he thought, in a more practical spirit. Six
        hundred a year, he thought, was not a very large income ; but it was an income,
        and one which a year ago he never contemplated possessing, until getting gray
        in the public service. Why not realize perfect happiness at once ? He could
        conceive no bliss greater than living with', 1]

        \ end of the seven. For I must say, that as far as we can see, these Alexandrian\
        \ pedants were thorough pedants ; very polished and learned gentlemen, no\
        \ doubt, and, like Callimachus, the pets of princes : but after all, men who\
        \ thought that they could make up for not writing great works themselves,\
        \ by showing, with careful analysis and commentation, how men used to write\
        \ them of old, or rather how they fancied men used to write them ; for, consider,\
        \ if they had really known how the thing was done, they must needs have been\
        \ able to do it themselves. Thus Callimachus, the favourite of Ptolemy Philadelphus,\
        \ and librarian of his Museum, is the most distinguished grammarian, critic,\
        \ and poet of his day, and has for pupils Eratosthenes, Apollonius Rhodius,\
        \ Aristophanes of Byzantium, and a goodly list more. He is an encyclop\xE6\
        dia in himself. There is nothing the man does not know, or probably, if we\
        \ spoke more correctly, nothing he does not know about. He writes on history,\
        \ on the Museum, on barbarous names, on the wonders of the world, on public\
        \ games, on colonisation, on winds, on birds, on the rivers of the world,\
        \ and \u2014 ominous subject \u2014 a sort of comprehensive history of Greek\
        \ literature, with a careful classification of all authors, each under his\
        \ own heading. Greek literature was rather in the sere and yellow leaf, be\
        \ sure, when men thought of writing that sort of thing about it. But still,\
        \ he is an encyclop\xE6dic man, and, moreover, a poet. He writes an epic,\

        \ at Michillimackinack, in the then Territory of Michigan, this case came\
        \ under his care. The wound was in the lest side of the stomach, and in healing\
        \ there was left a valvular opening by which the process of digestion could\
        \ be fully observed. \" Resolved, That Dr. be remitted a judgment against\

        \ soon be carried into effect. LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. A Library Association\
        \ at one time existed here, which, it is to be regretted, long since became\
        \ defunct. It was founded in the winter of 1870, a large number of the prominent\
        \ pub lic-spirited citizens taking a part in the movement, and in some instances\
        \ subscribing liberally to the object. It was hoped and expected that such\
        \ an institution as a public library, suitably located, where books and periodicals\
        \ could be obtained merely for the asking, would attract and thereby benefit\
        \ a great many who could not, or would not, otherwise obtain good reading;\
        \ and would also furnish a place for young people to congregate where there\
        \ would be no bad influen ces. The intention was good, and the library ought\
        \ to have prospered, but, like very many good things, it was not properly\
        \ understood or appreciated. After organizing, the association hired the large\
        \ front room in Metcalf's Block, which is directly over the store now occupied\
        \ by Kel logg & AVilsey, for the library room, this being about the first\
        \ time it was used after building. The room was furnished with chairs, tables,\
        \ desk, book-case and stove, and books were contrib uted by various parties.\
        \ Drs. Henshal & Wight, and G. P. Gifford, presented the most and best works.\
        \ The office of the Oconomowoc Times, which had been running then a short\
        \ time, was on the same floor with the library, in a back room, and the editors\
        \ kindly allowed the use of their exchange list. By this means, there were\
        \ an abundance of papers and periodicals always on hand ; but, when Ashley\
        \ D. Harger took the paper he stopped the use of the exchange list, as he\
        \ wanted the papers for himself. Twice during the life of the association,\
        \ George Westover, and others, got up concerts and appropriated the funds\
        \ to the use of the library to pay rent. The regular membership fee was a\
        \ merely nominal sum, and consequently did not go far toward paying the expenses.\
        \ When the interest began to die out, of course the supply of funds died out\
        \ also, and at last, when there was nothing to pay for room rent, fire and\
        \ lights, D. H. Sum ner, who had been appointed librarian, resigned ; and\
        \ finally, in the spring of 1871, after a few spasmodic gasps for life, the\
        \ Library Association subsided. The books were then taken to George Westover's\
        \ office, he having been one of the leaders in the movement, where they remained\
        \ until 1876 ; then the fire company boys, thinking they might as well have\
        \ the use of what books there were, took them over to the engine-house where\
        \ what is left of them can be seen piled up in the corner of the room. As\

        April 1, and the entire country assembled to witness her arrival, which was
        welcomed with the " thunder of cannon." It seems that a library had been established
        in Terre Haute. At an election held September 6, 1824, the following officers
        were elected: president, Wm. C. Linton; trustees, James Farrington, Cur tis
        Gilbert, Wm. Clark, Nathaniel Huntington, D. H. Johnson, D. F. Durkee, and
        George Hussey ; librarian, John Britton. The library was open on Tuesdays
        and Saturdays. In the early issue of the "Register" we find a list of four
        mar riages, headed " Bright Prospects in the Northwest." The first fire mentioned
        is the distillery of John F. King. It oc curred February 5, 1825. Major Abraham
        Markle died March 26, 1826, aged fifty-seven years. The paper speaks of him
        thus : " Mr. Markle was born in Ulster county, New York, in 1769, and was
        one of the first and most enterpris ing settlers of Cayuga county, New York.
        From thence he emigrated to Upper Canada, and acquired a handsome fortune.
        He bore a con spicuous part in the opposition to the corruption and oppression
        prac ticed upon the people of the province by English rulers. He was a member
        of the provincial parliament for some time, and gave evidence of being animated
        by the spirit of those who laid the foundations ot American freedom. When
        war was declared between England and the United States, in 1812, he returned
        to his native country, accepted the appointment of major in her army, and
        distinguished himself in many hard-fought battles. As soon as the war was
        over he removed to this country, and the improvements he has made here are
        proofs of his indefatigable energy and public spirit." To this we will here
        add : Maj. Markle was, in personal appearance, of commanding presence. Physically
        he was a very large and power ful man, and would be noticed anywhere. He possessed
        great energy of character, was generous and warm-hearted, of an impulsive
        and fiery temper, and always ready to meet friend or foe. He loved to " run
        horses," and never declined a " social glass." A man of such decided traits
        of character could not but have his faults ; but perhaps no man was more respected
        and esteemed than Maj. Markle. In con sequence of his active participation
        in the war of 1812-15, all his property in Canada was confiscated by the English
        government. At the close of the war, congress, in order to compensate him
        and others similarly situated, granted him a large quantity of scrip, or land
        war rants, and extra pay, which he proceeded to locate on Wabash lands as
        soon as the first sale occurred. He thus became possessed of several', 1]
    - ['356 HISTORY OF PARKE COUNTY. Liberty Lodge, A.O.U.W, was organized here quite
        recently, and has a membership of twelve. In 1837 or 1838 a mysterious murder
        was committed in the north western part of the township, the murderer in this
        case also having escaped. The facts of the case are as follows: In the summer
        of 1837 or 1838 a man named Mead, a resident of the northwestern cor ner of
        Liberty, had been in Lodi one morning purchasing some goods, among other things
        having bought two hoes, a clothes-line, some sugar and coffee, and left for
        home with his purchases on horse back. On passing his father-in-law''s residence
        he stopped and ground the hoes, and refusing an invitation to dinner proceeded
        toward home. This was the last time he was seen alive. Half an hour after
        he left his father-in-law''s a neighbor came along, and, taking the same track,
        found Afead''s horse cropping grass by the wayside. Thinking that the animal
        had broken loose, he took it to Mead''s house and left it with his wife. Some
        few days elapsed and Mead did not turn up. A few days after his disappearance
        two men pass ing along the road were surprised at the enormous number of flies
        crossing the track, and apparently centering in a thicket about three rods
        from the road. After a short search they found the body of Mead in an advanced
        state of decomposition. When found, the body7 was lying on its right side,
        an empty7 bottle and a dead rattlesnake being situated close by, evidently
        to give the impression that the man had been bitten by the reptile, yet had
        succeeded in killing it before he expired. This, however, would not work well,
        as it was easily seen that the man had been dead some days before the snake,
        the latter being in a good state of preservation, while the former was very
        much decomposed. Suspicion pointed to Louis Thomas as being the guilty party,
        there having existed considerable ill feeling between him and the deceased.
        He was arrested by Constable John Thompson, and brought to trial before ''Squire
        Reynolds. Evidence sufficient to convict was not forthcoming, and Thomas proved
        where he had been all the day on which the murder was supposed to have been
        committed with the exception of an hour, and was acquitted. The articles purchased
        by Mead were afterward found concealed in a hollow log by the wayside, a short
        distance from where the body was discovered. Educational facilities are ample
        in this township, there being twelve districts and fourteen school-houses,
        all in good repair, and fitted up with all the latest improvements in school

        was appointed and met at the latter place on Sth of 4th month, 1834, which
        agreed to ask for a meeting to be known as the Western quarterly meeting,
        and that its assemblies take place on the second 7th day in the 2d, 5th, 8th

        the request of the committee by establishing it as desired, on the second
        7th day of 2d month, 1836, nearly two years after the proposition was first
        made. The first meeting held in the quarterly meeting-house, built by- Reuben

        \ to the University, and the gift is deemed a valuable one, from the rare\
        \ specimens of our early literature which enriches the collection. Among the\
        \ chief donors whose gifts are extensive and valuable may be named Principal\
        \ Adamson, Dr. Robert Johnston, the Rev. James Nairne of Wemyss, Dr. John\
        \ Stevenson, who held the chair of Logic and Metaphysics from 1730 till 1774,\
        \ Dr. William Thomson, Professor of Anatomy at Oxford ; and in 1872 the library\
        \ received a very valuable donation from J. O. Halliwell, the eminent Shaks\
        \ perian critic, a collection of works relating to Shakspere, and formed by\
        \ him at great cost. successors in office, for the purpose of demon strating\
        \ and explaining the structure, physiology, and diseases of the human body.\
        \ ' In 1859 Sir David Monro, M.D., presented a considerable collection of\
        \ anatomical preparations, formed by his talented father, Dr. Alexander Monro\
        \ tertius. Many valuable additions have been made since then ; among them,\
        \ some by the late John Goodsir, Professor of Anatomy, 1846- 186 7, more especially\
        \ in the comparative department ; and since his death the Senatus purchased\
        \ from his representatives his private museum and added it to the collection,\
        \ which now contains many thou sand specimens illustrative of human anatomy,\
        \ both normal and pathological, and of comparative anatomy. The average collection\
        \ of the university extends to about 150,000 volumes, and 700 volumes of MSS.\
        \ The university possesses above seventy valuable portraits and busts of ancient\
        \ and modern alumni, most of which are kept in the Senate Hall and library.\
        \ The latter possesses a fine copy of Fordun's Scotichronicon (on vellum)\
        \ in folio, from which Goodall's edition of 1775 was printed. There are minor\
        \ museums in connection with the classes of natural philosophy, midwifery,\
        \ ma teria medica and botany, and one was recently con structed by Professor\
        \ Geikie sor the use of the geological class. In October, 1S81, nearly the\
        \ whole of the great anatomical collection referred to here, including the\
        \ skeletons of the infamous Burke and one of his victims known as \" Daft\
        \ Jamie,\" was removed from the old to the new University buildings at Lauriston.\
        \ The Museum of Natural History was established in 181 2, in connection with\
        \ the university, and contains a most valuable zoological, geological, and\
        \ mineralogical collection, the greater portion of which was formed by the\
        \ exertions of Professor Robert Jamieson, who was fifty years Professor of\
        \ Natural History (from 1804 to 1854) and Regius keeper of the museum. In\
        \ 1854 it was transferred by the Town Council (at that time patrons of the\
        \ university) to Government, under whose control it has since remained. The\

        discussion of the day. The meetings of the society in those days were held
        in a large back room behind the shop of Wyatt, the picture dealer; which continued''
        to be the regular place of meeting, until the present commodious buildings
        were erected. It was an oblong-shaped and very ordinary-look ing apartment,
        with a ceiling of unequal height, being lower at the two ends by several feet,
        than in the centre. The president''s chair stood upon a slightly raised plat
        form at the end furthest from the door. There was a table in front of him,
        at which the chief officers of the society, the treasurer, and the librarian
        ordinarily sat. Long rows of benches, with backs to them, were placed facing
        the president, and extended as far as the door. On one of these benches, Wilton,
        accompanied by his friend Powell, and also by the renowned Harvey, took his
        place about a quarter-past eight, on the evening of the Thursday following
        Mr. Ingram''s breakfast party. Wilton was greeted on his entrance with the
        satisfactory information that he had been duly elected about a quarter of
        an hour before, and this gave him a sense of being at home, as it were, which
        was very agreeable. He felt, in fact, already quite interested in the proceed
        ings. He had always had a fancy for English history, and was better acquainted
        with the particulars of the great national struggle of Cromwell''s time than
        most men of his age. There had been a good deal in his antecedents which induced
        him to sympathize with Powell, over and above his sense of the latter''s civility.

        \ had a keen attraction for a man of Wilton's temper. He felt no inclination\

        of Julius and the civil wars subsequent thereto, was left for Augustus, who
        assigned a fund out of tlie Dalmatian booty for this purpose, which he put
        into the hands of the celebrated Asinius Pollio, who therewith sounded a temple
        to liberty on Mount Aventine, and with the help of Sylla''s and Varro''s Collections,
        in addition to his own purchases, opened the first public library in Rome
        in an apartment annexed to the temple above mentioned. Two others were afterward
        instituted by the same em peror, which he called the Octavian and Palatine
        libraries; the first, so named in honour of his sister, was placed in the
        temple of Juno; the latter, as its title spe cifies, was in the imperial palace:
        these libraries were royally endowed with estab lishments of Greek and Latin
        librarians, of which C. Julius Hyginus, the grammarian, was one. an idle hour
        amongst the other recreations of the place; in like manner their country houses
        and even public offices were provided for the use and amusement of their guests
        and clients. The Roman libraries, in point of disposi tion, much resembled
        the present fashion observed in our public ones ; for the books were not placed
        against the walls, but brought into the area of the room, in sep arate cells
        and compartments, where they were lodged in presses: the intervals be tween
        these compartments were richly orna mented with inlaid plates of glass and
        ivory, and marble bass-relievos. In these compart ments, which were furnished
        with desks and couches for the accommodation of readers, it was usual to place
        statues of learned men, one in each ; and this we may observe is one of the
        few elegances wdiich Rome was not indebted to Greece for, the first idea having
        been started by the accomplished Pollio, who in his library on Mount Aventine
        set up the statue of his illustrious contemporary Varro, even whilst he was
        living: it was usual also to ornament the press where auy considerable author''s
        works were con tained, with his figure in brass or plaster of a smaller size.
        The Emperor Tiberius added another library to the palace, and attached his
        new building to that front which looked towards the Via Sacra, in which quarter
        be himself resided. Vespasian endowed a public library in the temple of Peace.
        Trajan founded the famous Ulpian library in his new forum, from whence it
        was at last removed to the Collis Viminalis to furnish the baths of Dio clesian.
        The Capitoline library is supposed to have been founded by Domitian, and was
        consumed, together with the noble edifice to which it was attached, by a stroke
        of light ning in the time of Commodus. The Em peror Hadrian enriched his favourite
        villa with a superb collection of books, and lodged them in a temple dedicated
        to Hercules. These were, in succeeding times, so multi plied by the munificence
        and emulation of the several emperors, that in the reign of Constantino Rome
        contained no less than twenty-nine public libraries, of which the principal
        were the Palatine and the Ulpian. Though books were then collected at an immense
        expense, several private citizens of fortune made considerable libraries.
        Tyran nio, the grammarian, even in the time of Sylla was possessed of three
        thousand vol umes: Epaphroditus, a grammarian also, had in later times collected
        thirty thousand of the most select and valuable books ; but Sammonicus Serenus
        bequeathed to the Em peror Gordian a library containing no less than sixty-two
        thousand volumes. It was not always a love of literature that tempted people
        to these expenses, for Seneca com plains of the vanity of the age in furnishing
        their banquetting rooms with books, not for use, but for show, and in a mere
        spirit of profusion. Their baths, both hot and cold, were always supplied
        with books to fill up There is one more circumstance attending these public
        libraries, which ought not to be omitted, as it marks the liberal spirit of
        their institution : it was usual to appropriate an adjoining building for
        the use and accom modation of students, where every thing was furnished at
        the emperor''s cost: they were lodged, dieted, and attended by servants specially
        appointed, and supplied with every thing, under the e}re of the chief librarian,
        that would be wanting whilst they were en gaged in their studies, and had
        occasion to consult the books: this establishment was kept up in a very princely
        style at Alexan dria in particular, where a college was en dowed and a special
        fund appointed for its support, with a president and proper officers under
        him, for the entertainment of learned strangers, who resorted thither from
        various parts to consult those invaluable collections which that famous library
        contained in all branches of science. Observer, No. 51. SAMUEL HORSLEY, LL.D.,

        \ desiring to unite in the formation of a church, Sept. 1, 1870, and it was\
        \ presented to the Presbytery, at Matoon, 111. On the 4th of October in the\

        \ Rep. INCORPORATION. The town was incorporated under the general city and\
        \ village law in May 1872. The first board of Trustees consisted of the following\
        \ named persons: \u2014 C. M. Leiberman, Dr. C. Voorhees, W- T. Ricks, E.\
        \ S. Shull and J. T. Hall ; with Dr. Silas Irion as Po lice Magistrate. The\
        \ financial interests are of fair proportions, as may be inferred from the\
        \ fact that upward of $200,000 worth of merchandize is an nually sold by retail\
        \ alone, with an annual sale of from 50,000 to 60,000 feet of lumber ; and\
        \ from 700,000 to 800,000 bushels of grain is received yearly, and either\
        \ manufactured into flour here, or shipped to distant markets, together with\
        \ a large amount of stock, worth, perhaps, $60,000, making, in the aggregate,\
        \ annually, a large sum of money that is employed in the transaction of business.\
        \ The present board of Trustees are : \u2014 J. W. Campbell, J. T. Hall, J.\
        \ L. Terrell, G. A. Vandeveer, Jos. Sanford and J. D. Offlighter. The streets\
        \ are kept in a fair condition, and good plank walks are laid on all the principal\
        \ ones. A large number of shade and orna mental trees have been planted, and\
        \ in a few years they will greatly aid in enhancing the beauty of the town.\
        \ SCHOOLS. Early attention was given to educational facilities. Under town\
        \ ship organization, a neat frame school-house was built May 1, 1870. It was\
        \ used also as a town hall and for church purposes. To avoid disputes and\
        \ unpleasant feelings, and to keep the peace, the directors assigned a special\
        \ Sabbath to each denomination. Miss Gertrude Pence was the first teacher\
        \ employed by the district to occupy it. As the town increased in population\
        \ the erection of a larger house became necessary. In 1874, the board of directors\
        \ met and decided on the cost and plan of a building, which was soon erected.\
        \ It is a brick structure, 40x50 feet in size, two stories high, aud con tain-\
        \ suitable rooms for three departments. It was completed at a cost of $10,000.\
        \ FINALE. In this brief record of Morrisonville there is but little to regret,\
        \ and much to awaken a just pride. On all the stirring questions of her time\
        \ she has occupied advanced ground in the van of progress. Her people were\
        \ early friends of the Temperance cause; and zealous advocates of education\
        \ and religion from the start. Knowing that good society is the outgrowth\
        \ of a sound morality as taught in the church, she established churches, and\
        \ liberally maintained them. Conscious that the sum of human happiness is\
        \ increased by culture, she early established schools, and has generously\
        \ sustained them. Believing that prosperity is the reward of enterprise, she\
        \ has evinced a stirring activity in the pursuits of the various industries,\
        \ and has prospered. Feeling that a manly independence is what makes the free\
        \ man, her people have carved their own way, and are not place seekers. Realizing\
        \ that worth makes the man, her people do no homage to place or station and\
        \ court no man for patronage. Her history is not yet made ; the first ten\
        \ years of her existence was lay ing the groundwork, from which history is\
        \ hereafter to be con structed. The building is an ornament to the place and\
        \ speaks well for the enterprise of the people and the interest they exhibit\
        \ in popular education. CHURCHES. Mr Van Emmon, a Dunkard, has the credit\
        \ of preaching the tir-t sermon in Morrisonville, May 22, 1870, in the first\
        \ school ho-ose, soon after its completion.", 1]

        \ There was a log-church built on the east side of the creek, about 1838 or\
        \ '39. In this church, in 1842, the first Sunday-school in the county was\
        \ organized. James H. Boyd was the superintendent, and Thomas P. Bond, secretary\
        \ and librarian. Is situated on section thirteen of this township, on the\
        \ line of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railroad, about five miles south\
        \ west of Taylorville. It was named in honor of Y. B. Clark, one of the original\
        \ proprietors. It was laid out by Y. B. Clark, and platted by Richard Powel,\
        \ in 1871. It has about one hundred and fifty population. Harpers Ferry was\
        \ the name of a little town or trading-post, located on the east side of Bear\
        \ Creek, near the Jernigan bridge, on the old Edwardsville road. It was the\
        \ first town on the creek, and was a point of some importance. It had a post-office,\
        \ stores and saloons. C. M. Leberman, of Morrisonville, was the principal\
        \ merchant. He kept a general stock of dry-goods and groceries. They all flourished\
        \ and were well patronized, but as the new towns along the railroads sprang\
        \ up the merchants abandoned it, and sought better locations. The post-office\
        \ was established in 1870. The post-masters have been L. Park, E. K. Brock,\
        \ G. Walton, C. A. Clark, and W. M. Gladish. A flouring mill known as the\
        \ \" Clarksdale Mill,\" was erected in 1872, by Y. B. Clark, with a run of\
        \ three burr. It was burned by an incendiary in May, 1876. The school-house\
        \ is a one story frame building, erected in 1871, by direction of Y. B. Clark,\
        \ E. K. Brock, and S. W. Hawkins. These are the important incidents in its\
        \ earlier history. But with the tide of emigration this section of the county\
        \ has rapidly filled up. New interests have been developed and lands have\
        \ greatly advanced. Below is a list of the present business houses. Elevator\

        \ other apartments in the interior. They purchased $700 worth of boats. The\
        \ boat-house was lo cated on the Esopus, at the mouth of Tannery Creek, better\
        \ known as the Muddy. South from the boat-house they had a course of a mile\
        \ and a half, straight as if laid out by an engineer, and from 200 to 300\
        \ feet wide. It was thus a fine course for shell-boat racing, and is indeed\

  - - ['4 PREFACE. But this history belongs to the State rather than to a single county
        : in the present work the writer has attempted only such an outline of the
        early discoveries and settlements in Maine as seemed necessary to fairly connect
        the subject with his local history. This is given in two or three of the preliminary
        chapters. It is unnecessary here to enumerate the authors consulted in the
        present volume, as they are generally referred to in the foot-notes or in
        the text of the work. Much is due, however, to the labors of our prede cessors,
        especially to those of the late Hon. William Willis, LL.D., the historian
        of Portland, and a large contributor to other historical collections, whose
        eminent and exhaustive labors have left little to be under taken in the way
        of original research within the limits of the subjects treated of by him.
        The most that we have attempted in that direction has been a thorough examination
        and comparison of the works of this author with other sources of evidence
        and information, with a view to obtaining the most accurate facts of history.
        To this we have added a large amount of original matter relating to the city
        of Portland, to the towns, to several important chapters of the general history,
        and many biographical sketches of citizens. The history contained in the present
        volume has been compiled with great care and labor, yet it has been a pleasure
        to the writer. The citizens of the county, in nearly every locality, have
        manifested an in terest in the work, and many have freely and cheerfully aided
        in the collection of materials. Our thanks, and those of the publishers, are
        clue to Gen. J. Marshall Brown, of Portland, for valuable aid and sugges tions.
        Also to Hon. W. W. Thomas, Sr., Hon. Nathan Clifford, Hon. Edward Fox, Hon.
        Lot Morrill, Hon. Charles W. Goddard, William E. Gould, Esq., Hon. Israel
        Washburn, Jr., George E. B. Jackson, Esq., Fabius M. Ray, Esq., Nathan Webb,
        Esq., Gen. Charles P. Mattocks, and others, of Portland; to Gen. Joshua L.
        Chamberlain, of Brunswick ; and to Mr. S. M. Watson, librarian, by whose courtesy
        we have had access to many books of reference in the city library, and to
        the valuable collections of the Willis Room in that institution. In connection
        with the town histories, our thanks are also due to Hon. Warren H. Vinton,
        of Gray ; Hon. N. S. Littlefield and Professor A. F. Richardson, of Bridgton;

        other gentlemen have aided us in procuring matter for our local histories
        of towns and villages, whose names are too numerous to be mentioned in this
        connection. We are indebted to the editors of the city and county press, to
        the clerk of the courts and his assistants, to many clergymen and members
        of school boards and town clerks, who have courteously and freely rendered

        new museum of specimens, and, through the liberality of the State and citizens,
        purchased land and constructed a fine edifice on Congress Street for their
        deposit and for lecture-rooms. This, too, was swept away by fire in the great
        conflagration of 1866. The city took part of the land for widening Con gress
        Street, and the remainder was sold. The society now occupy rooms in the City
        Hall building, where they have already collected a valuable, though not large
        cabinet. In 1876 it purchased the spacious Day property on Elm Street, and
        at present is making earnest efforts towards erecting a substantial and commodious
        building thereon, with proper laboratories and lecture-rooms, and galleries
        for the accommodation of its collections. A finer location for such a building
        could not be found in the city. THE PRESUMPSCOT IRON COMPANY. The works of
        this company are located at the mouth of Presumpscot River, about two miles

        The law library, belonging to the Cumberland bar, came to an end in the great
        fire. Soon after, Mrs. Greenleaf, of Cambridge, Mass., hearing of the loss,
        tendered the law library of her late husband, which had descended from his
        father, Simon Greenleaf, formerly of this city, as a gift to the bar, which
        was grate fully received. It consisted of 1260 volumes. This has been increased
        by purchase, so that the library now com prises 2700 volumes. Contributions
        of natural and artificial curiosities are so licited from sea-captains and
        others, who are in the way of obtaining them. Officers : Dr. William Wood,
        President ; Sylvester B. Beckett, Vice-President ; John M. Gould, Corresponding
        and Recording Secretary ; Edward Gould, Treasurer. These, with seven associate

        100. The as sociation has a valuable collection of oratorio and other music.
        An association under this name was incorporated Jan. 22, 1867, its object
        being to establish and maintain " a library, and an institute of natural history,
        science, and art, in the city of Portland." Through the munificence of the
        city authorities, spacious rooms have been provided for the library, etc.,
        in the city building, and the number of bound volumes already collected is
        nearly 26,000, whilst a goodly display of the busts of celebrated men, and
        other works of art, adorn the rooms. The library is on the north westerly
        side of the city building, on the main floor. Citi zens, by paying $2 per
        annum, have the privilege of taking out two books at any time ; and the use
        of the books on the premises is free to all comers. The teachers of the public
        schools and members of the city government have use of the library free of
        charge. Officers for 1879: John B. Coyle, Jr., President; G. B. Buzelle, Vice-President;

        F. How. Richard How, the second, received a liberal education, and devoted
        himself to the collection, and enjoyment, of the books forming the Library,
        still in being, and cared for with reverence by Mrs. Lucy How. Richard How,
        began his collections in early life ; he accumulated above five thousand volumes.
        He was not a mere collector, but a diligent student. He wrote a critical,
        laboured defence, of Lord William Russell, against the charges of Dalrymple,
        the his torian. He obtained permission, of the Duke of Bed ford, to edit the
        Letters of Lady Rachel Russell, then in MS. at Woburn Abbey ; and it is owing
        to him, that these incomparable, and popular, Epistles, saw the light. By
        a note in his handwriting, in his own first copy of the Letters, it appears
        that the first Edition, was published in quarto, on May 18th, 1773, of five
        hundred copies ; the second, of five hundred, on June 15th the same year ;
        the third, of one thousand, in 1776; and their popularity still attests the
        judg ment of the worthy librarian. Among the treasures in this Library, are
        many MSS. : a notable MS. of the Romaunt de la Rose ; a unique and deeply
        interesting Manuscript, on fine vellum, forming a handsome, stout, quarto
        volume, in early English, " The Lyfe of Kateryne of Siena, written by a Brother
        of Sion;" an exquisite pocket Bible, written in Latin, on the purest vellum,

        of good offices, respecting early Reformation literature. Most of the letters,

        his Grace himself told me, he was surprised to find that he could make out,
        nearly the whole of a speech addressed to him, on landing, by the principal
        officer of the port, at which he, and the troops under his command, disembarked.
        The Duke, being anxious to know something of the book and the translator,
        sent it to me in 1837, when I made out the best account I could, and forwarded
        it with the volume which his Grace had given to a lady." Dr. Bliss, had subjoined
        other notes respecting the Spanish translator, which it were needless to repeat
        here. The volume came afterwards, by gift or other wise, into the possession
        of Dr. Bliss, and was sold with his library. I sent it to my friend Luis,
        with all its contents, as the best copy of its kind, adding some notes of
        my own. About this time, I went to visit some family relations living in the
        village of Waterbeach, on the border of the fens, five miles from Cambridge.
        I took this opportunity to enlarge my knowledge of books, for the librarian
        of Trinity College, since deceased, was somewhat related to my host. It was
        delightful in the early summer mornings, to walk over to Cam bridge, and while
        the yellow sunshine streamed in at the long gallery window on the statue by
        Thorwaldsen of the Poet of the age, how charming was it when turning over

    - ['THE LIFE OF B. B. WIFFEN. 84 In society, his presence was a continued testimony
        for truth, gentleness, and justice. He was charmingly human, and a poetic
        temperament, gave grace to his sympathy with all knowledge ; but he was so
        enamoured with his chosen study of the Spanish reformers, that he would not
        long be diverted from communion, with these "dead but sceptred sovereigns
        who still rule our spirits from their urns." The sacredness of his settled
        purpose, gave him always a quiet dignity, and his charming manners, and innocent
        wit, were favourable introductions to the subjects of his constant enthusiasm.
        His devotion to these, was determined by love for the men, whose names he
        restored to fame, and love for the Truth which they held unto death, and on
        a determination that the world, in these after ages, should know who had been
        its benefactors. B. B. Wiffen, was the son of John and Elizabeth Wiffen, of
        Woburn, and was born there in the year 1794. His father, was a man of superior
        culture and taste ; the family was originally from Norfolk, and his more remote
        ancestors from Germany, where they were Von Wimpffens. His mother, was a woman
        of strong character, a memoir of whom, written by B. B. Wiffen, appears in
        a subsequent portion of these volumes. The elder brother of B. B. Wiffen,
        was Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen, librarian to the Duke of Bedford, at Woburn Abbey,
        and the translator of Tasso, into elegant English verse. The brothers went

        to obtain a sac-simile reprint, and he knew of no printer who could execute
        it. However, he wrote, asking me, if I could undertake it, stating the diffi
        culties he was under. I shrank from the responsibility, yet my desire, overcame
        my doubts, and hesitation. I replied, that I would do it, and as it would
        be in England, it might be accompanied by an English translation, which I
        had already roughly prepared when I first read the book. I wished also, that
        some information should be added, respecting the personages mentioned in the
        volume. My answer satisfied him. He had his Spanish translation ready, and
        the reprint might go out, together with the two translations, as an evidence
        of our love of the author, and of our mutual friendship. He prepared, and
        sent me over by the post, a beautiful transcript of the Italian, done by his
        own hand. He objected to run the risk, of the transmission of the original

        allowed to copy it, and after the transcript had lain by me for some years,
        I now found the Spanish original, of the English tract of John Daniel, in

        such fidelity, and grace, that the Librarian of Woburn Abbey, having seen

        \ was extended and a room was built for the bible class, the whole improvement\
        \ costing about $1,200. At this time the membership of the school was 400\
        \ pupils and 28 teachers. December 1, 1866, Mr. Me Williams removed to New\
        \ York city, and Mr. G. H. Mc- Ilvaine was elected superintendent. Up to this\

        \ 1878, at the office of Mrs. Emery, in the Transcript building, five ladies\
        \ being pre sent at the meeting. The constitution of the society was then\

        \ were elected, by-laws adopted, and the society put into full working order\

        \ and are fitted up with the simplicity and elegance of true Art. Here may\
        \ already be found quite a number of real art gems, and the student of art,\
        \ if desirous, will be freely accorded the privilege to work or study. The\
        \ members are all \" Students of Art,\" not in idea only, but in fact, and\
        \ the meetings at the rooms are for the purpose of comparing and interchanging\

        \ of immigration to Peoria and vicinity, quite a number of men who had taken\
        \ part in the Mexican war, and as year was added to year, these veterans fell\
        \ in with each other, and it was only natural that a deep-seated and warm\
        \ hearted friendship should spring up between them, notwithstanding they were\
        \ sons of different States, had been members of different companies and different\
        \ regiments and that they had never seen each other until their chance meetings\
        \ at Peoria. In 1874 it was found there was quite a number of these heroes\

        her fostering care. She obtained a library for the school from New York, and
        her son was made librarian. Some of these books are yet found in that locality,
        treasured as mementoes of what one woman''s energy did for the Christian cause
        in a new country. In 1841 Mr. Matthews was elected Auditor of this county,
        and the family removed to South Bend, the county seat. Here Mrs. Matthews
        was largely instrumental in organizing the Reformed Church Sunday-school,
        and every member of her family was con- nected with it either as teacher or
        scholar. After Mr. Colfax''s election to Congress, Mr. Matthews received an
        appointment at Washington, and during the sessions of Congress was there with
        his wife. For nine years they formed part of Mr. Colfax''s family there, residing
        with him, and during five of the six years of his Speakership, Mrs. Matthews
        "received" with him, acting as the head of his family, he being a -widower.
        Though 60 years old then, her vivacity, as well as her genial manners, was
        remarkable, and in a great measure served to make her son''s receptions the
        most popular in Washington. Her popularity in social circles was uni- versal.
        President Lincoln had a deep and abiding friendship for her, and a great respect
        for her judgment on important public questions which came up in his administration,
        and in which she took all the interest of a statesman. Frequently at her son''s
        recep- tions, she was the recipient of the most flattering attentions from
        the martyred President. Shortly after the war, that terrible disease, cancer,
        commenced its ravages upon her system. Five times extirpated, it returned
        each time with increased violence. Once it was thought the dis- ease was mastered,
        and her family were quite hopeful; but while returning from California, in
        1869, she was attacked with mountain fever, and came near dying at Cheyenne.
        From that time she failed, and although every effort was made to destroy the
        disease, it became evident, in time, that the cancer had obtained absolute
        mastery of the system, and that nothing could longer hold it in bay. Her sufferings
        for several years were indescribably great, and but for her strong hold on
        life, and the most faithful, affectionate and devoted nursing by her husband,
        she must have sooner succumbed to the intense agony she often endured, in
        addition to the terrible drain npon her system. She bore it all, however,
        with Christian resignation, illustrating that profession in which for forty
        years she had never faltered, and with abiding faith that beyond this life
        she would be free from pain and anguish. After her return from Washington,
        in the spring of 1872, she steadily grew worse. As long as she could keep
        up her husband took her riding daily, but daily these rides were made shorter,
        until at last her vital forces were so sapped and weakened she was com- pelled
        to keep her room and finally her bed. For two or three years previous to her
        death she scarcely saw any company, and her family had but little lest it
        might weary her.', 1]

        MARY''S ACADEMY. One ofthe most important objects of interest in the history
        of St. Joseph county, is Saint Mary''s Academy, conducted by the Sis ters
        of the Holy Cross. Although the order of the Holy Cross was founded at Notre
        Dame in 1842, and although tbe Sisters of the Holy Cross were established
        at Bertrand, Michigan, as early as 1845, yet Saint Mary''s did not occupy
        its present charming site until 1855. Nature seems to have selected and laid
        out the spot for the religious and educational uurposes to which it is now
        consecrated. A table-land of 110 acres on the high bank of the St. Joseph

        sented itself to the eyes of those who had in view an institution of learning
        to which all coming generations would bring its daughters, and where they
        would not only find a home during the trying years of school life, but from
        which they would carry the germs of those noble womanly graces which must
        be the guerdon of the future glory of our republic. With that untiring energy
        which marks an earnest purpose the building at Bertrand was removed to the
        banks of the St. Joseph and made the nucleus of the wooden buildings which
        until 1859 were nestled among these groves. The present substantial brick

        engaged in the business from 1S35 to 1852. " Horatio Chapin also, at this
        time located in our midst. He started his goods from Detroit by way of the
        lakes as early in the spring as he could, but they did not reach here until
        July, when he opened the first general dry-goods store not connected with
        the Indian trade. He commenced business in a hewed-log cabin on St. Joseph
        street, on the lot where Mrs. Massey now lives. He was about twenty-eight
        years old, and as strict a Presbyterian then as when he died. I remember his
        goods came up the river on Satur day afternoon, and were immediately piled
        out on the bank of the river, but there were no teams to be had to haul them
        up to the store that afternoon. Next morning there were plenty, but next morning
        was Sunday, and no man or beast could work for him on that day. So the goods
        had to lie there, exposed to the weather, with nobody to look after them until
        Alonday morning. He was one of that kind of men that if he said the horse
        was 16 feet high he would stick to it; at least he never would be argued out
        of it. If he changed his opinion it would be of his own volition, not from
        what any one else would say. For the first year or two he did quite a thriving
        business, and then he was unfortunate in losing two stocks of goods on the
        lakes. He was the first county school commissioner, and as such had charge
        of the sale of the sixteenth section of school lands. This office was held
        by him for several years, and as long as he would keep it, always discharging
        his duties up to the spirit of the law; as he did everything else. " To effect
        the removal of the county-seat from St. Joseph to South Bend, a donation of
        lots was made to the county by the proprietors ofthe latter place, to enable
        it to build county build ings, but there was a reservation of ten per cent,
        of the proceeds arising from the sale of the lots to be appropriated for a
        county library. This fund with some other was collected together, and Mr.
        Chapin appointed to select and purchase the books. He ac cepted the trust
        and faithfully executed it, and acted as librarian for many years without
        compensation. Many of those old books are now in the McClure Library. I had
        never seen a historical book before, except Weem''s Life of AVashington, and
        Horry''s Life of Gen. Marion. Rollins, Gibbon, Plutarch, Josephus, and such
        works opened a new world to me. Though Rollins, Plutarch aud Josephus may
        be full of fabulous stories, still I think they are cap ital good books for
        boys to read as well as men. After Mr. Chapin quit the mercantile business
        he was for a short time engaged in warehousing and buying produce. When the
        branch of the first State Bank was established here he was made its cashier,
        and con tinued in that office until its charter expired. He was a peculiar
        and remarkable character, very intelligent and thoughtful, always trying to
        live a strictly Christian life; yet his temper was so quick, and when excited
        so stubborn and self-willed, that one might as', 1]

        Soon afterward P. Klingel & Sons commenced in the boot and shoe trade at No.
        80, Michigan street. All of the firm being practical shoemakers, quite a large
        business in manufacturing boots and shoes was soon estab lished. In the early
        spring of 1856 our subject made a tour of the West, but returned to South
        Bend in the fall of that year, when he became the sole proprietor of the flourishing
        business established by P. Klingel & Sons. He added to the former business
        that of dealing in hides and leather, which was continued under the firm name
        of John Klingel & Bro., until 1872, when, partly on account of failing health,
        the business was sold out to other parties. In 1873 Mr. K. made a trip to
        Europe for his health, attended the great World''s Exhibition at Vienna and
        many places of note on the con tinent. Returning home much improved in health,
        he engaged in traveling for the sale of furniture, and later and up to the
        present time for the " Coquillard Wagon Factory." When South Bend was organized
        as a city in 1864 he was elected as Councilman from the first ward, and at
        the expiration of his term was re-elected, but resigned his seat soon after
        commencing his second term. He received no opposition at either of the above
        elec tions. In the same year he was appointed a member of the City Board of
        Education, to which position he has been steadily re-elected and served the
        city faithfully, with the exception of one year, while in Europe, up to the
        present time. To illustrate the well-earned esteem in which he is held, it
        is said that no matter what political party was in power, whenever his name
        came up for election to the above office there was never a single vote cast
        against him. All the school-houses in the city except two have been built
        since Mr. K. was a member of the Board, and no one is better known or more
        popular among the school children of South Bend than their friend John Klingel.
        He is now Treasurer ofthe School Board, and when in the city devotes nearly
        his entire time to the educational inter ests of the place. Under Mr. Klingel''s
        direction graded schools were first established in South Bend, and the first
        superintendent appointed. In 1875 the City Council transferred the City Library,
        consist ing of over 2,000 volumes, to the City School Board. The library was
        at once removed to the high-school building, and Mr. Klingel volunteered his
        services as librarian, and for over two years devoted two days of each week
        to this work free of charge. Under his direc tion it became one ofthe most
        popular institutions in the city and increased to 2,500 volumes. Mr. K. was
        one of the first members of Germania Lodge No. 301, A. F. & A. M., and has
        been Master of said lodge off and on for 10 years; also is a member of South
        Bend Chapter No. 29, R. A. M., and a Sir Knight of Warsaw Commandery No. lit.
        Mr. Klingel was married Dec 6,1857, at South Bend, to Miss Fyette Dice, a

        \ the year 1868, when it was set apart as an independent charge, with the\
        \ following appointments: County Farm, Mudge's, Castleton Centre, and Martin's\
        \ School-house. Miss Mary Hindmarch. The present school, under the superintendence\
        \ of R. M. Payne and an able corps of assistants, is organizad on the \" graded\"\
        \ plan, and has gained an enviable reputation for thoroughness and excellence\
        \ in all its departments. The'earliest society in connection with this church\
        \ was formed in 1866, under the supervision of Rev. T. J. Spen cer, then connected\
        \ with the Woodland Circuit. The members embraced in the first class were\
        \ George Gregg, E. M. Mallett and wife, Minor Mallett and wife, L. J. Wheeler,\
        \ and Mrs. Clendennin. The grist-mill erected by Mallett & Johnson then afforded\
        \ a place of meeting, the first service having been conducted by Rev. H. J.\
        \ Richards. Soon after a log building was erected as a temporary school house,\
        \ which was located in the rear of the present Yates Block. This structure\
        \ was placed at the disposal of the band of worshipers until a small framed\
        \ building owned by Mr. Appleman afforded more ample accommodations. THE MEDICAL\
        \ FRATERNITY OF NASHVILLE. The first physician to establish himself in Nashville\
        \ was Dr. J. H. Palmer, who followed his profession there from 1865 until\
        \ 1867 without a rival or a colleague. During the latter year Dr. C. W. Wickham\
        \ came from Eaton County, his former home. He is still in active practice\
        \ at Nashville. Dr. Wickham was followed in the spring of 1870 by Dr. H. A.\
        \ Barber, of Lansing, Mich., who had been a practitioner in Minnesota before\
        \ returning to his native State. He was the first representative of the hom\u0153\

        \ member of the State Hom\u0153opathic Medi cal Society, as well as the vice-president\
        \ of the Hom\u0153o pathic Medical Society of Barry and Eaton Counties. On\
        \ the erection of the present school-house a still more convenient place of\
        \ meeting was offered. The earliest Sunday-school was organized in 1806, with\
        \ E M. Mallett as superintendent. In 1869, with a view to the erection of\
        \ a church edifice, lots were purchased of Robert Gregg, and the following\
        \ year a building Avas erected under the ministrations of Rev. R. Pengally.\
        \ The pastors in succes sion have been Rev. T. J. Spencer, Rev. J. S. Harder,\
        \ Rev. R. Pengally, Rev. L. M. Edmonds, Rev. C. H. Ellis, Rev. J. M. Akin,\
        \ Rev. E. L. Kellogg, Rev. C. G. Thomas, Rev. N. L. Brockway, and the present\
        \ pastor in charge, Rev. A. D. Newton. A flourishing Sunday-school is connected\
        \ with the church, of which L. J. Wheeler is superintendent. It numbers 150\
        \ scholars, with a constantly increasing attend ance. Arthur Ainsworth is\
        \ librarian, and J. C. F. Dillon secretary. The present board of trustees\
        \ of the church are Lorenzo Mudge, Jacob Purkey, D. Staley, H. Coe, Dr. H.\
        \ A. Barber. Dr. W. H. Young, formerly of Toronto, Canada, became a resident\
        \ of Nashville in 1870, where he has ever since practiced. He is a graduate\
        \ of the medical department of Toronto University and of the Detroit Medical\
        \ College, and is also a member of the State Medical Society. Dr. W. H. Griswold,\
        \ a native of Olivet, Eaton Co., Mich., en gaged in the practice of medicine\
        \ in Nashville in October, 1878, having formerly resided in Maple Grove. He\
        \ is a graduate of the Detroit Hom\u0153opathic Medical College, from which\
        \ he received his diploma in 1875. Dr. F. A. Jones has just begun the practice\
        \ of his profession in Nashville, having arrived in the spring of 1880. THE\
        \ LEGAL PROFESSION. The capacity of the building is unequal to the wants of\
        \ the large concourse of worshipers, and as a result a more commodious edifice\
        \ will doubtless supersede it. Lewis Durkee became a resident of Nashville\
        \ iu 1866, and for several years was engaged in business pursuits. Having\
        \ during this time devoted much attention to the study of law, he obtained\
        \ admission to the bar and entered on the practice of his profession, in which\
        \ he is still actively engaged. Abijah M. Flint, a native of Eaton Co , Mich.,\
        \ came to this village in 1868. He made but a brief stay at that time, removing\
        \ to Kansas, where he remained six years. In 1875 he returned to Nashville,\
        \ and is now fol lowing his profession at that place. BAPTIST CHURCH. The\
        \ earliest meetings of the Baptist Society were held at the school-house,\
        \ and the subject of organization was dis cussed at a gathering of those interested,\

        of the first settler of Martin, received a certificate to teach in district
        No. 2 (the Chambers neighborhood) June 25, 1844, and upon as suming control
        of the twelve little barefoots intrusted to her supervision, became the first
        teacher in the township. The house, a small log structure which had formerly
        done duty as Chambers'' shingle shanty, was situated in the village of Wayland,
        and among the principal patrons were Nelson Chambers, Joseph Heydenberk, and
        John Parsons. The following winter Miss Eldred taught in the Gregg neighbor
        hood. In later years she became the wife of Ebenezer Wilder, of Martin, where
        both reside at present writing. SCHOOL INSPECTORS. Alfred Mann, 1845 ; Samuel

        1875, the " Women''s Crusade Band" was the only temperance organization in
        the village, and the temperance-workers concluded to form a society which,
        while offering ample facilities for aggressive work, should include both men
        and women, and also present social advan tages to reformed men. Accordingly,
        early in January, 1876, J. W. Scott, of Pontiac, held two meetings, the main
        points discussed having been the relative merits of different plans of organization
        for work. The majority seeming to favor the organization of a lodge of Good
        Templars, a meet ing was held at the Presbyterian church, January 24th, and
        a lodge was organized known as Allegan Lodge, No. 938. The following officers
        were chosen : Worthy Chief Templar, R. C. Crawford ; Worthy Vice Templar,
        Mrs. H. A. Pope; Sec, D. P. Simmons; Assistant Sec, Grace B. Sailor; Treas.,

        ; Lodge Deputy, Luther Fowler. OTHER SOCIETIES. THE ALLEGAN LITERARY AND LIBRARY
        ASSOCIATION. This association was organized in June, 1871, a meeting having
        been called at the office of A. H. Fenn the previous March for the purpose.
        Dr. E. Amsden was appointed chairman, and J. B. Humphrey secretary. A. S.
        Butler, who was foremost in the enterprise, stated the object of the gathering.
        After a free discussion and interchange of views, a committee was selected
        to draft a plan for a per manent organization. It consisted of A. S. Butler,
        John W. Stone, William J. Pollard, H. C. Weeks, and J. B. Humphrey. The meeting
        then adjourned subject to call. On the 23d of May a meeting was held in Empire
        Hall, at which a constitution and by-laws were adopted, 50 mem bers and 2
        life members (A. S. Butler and C. W. Hall) having joined the association.
        Annual members were to pay $1 each per year, while life-members paid $25 once
        for all. J. B. Humphrey was made chairman of this meeting, and held office
        until the regular annual gathering in June. Papers were circulated the same
        evening, and 60 persons who wished to engage in the work signed their names
        to the roll. The lodge now began steadily to increase in num bers and influence.
        Proposals for membership followed in regular order, the largest number initiated
        at a single meet ing having been 20. At the end of three months the number
        had increased to 178, and at the end of six months to 216, this being the
        maximum number during the exist ence of the lodge. At this time, and until
        the meeting of the Grand Lodge, in October, 1878, Allegan Lodge was the banner
        lodge of the State. At the end of the first year the books showed 181 names
        in good standing, which de creased slowly to 116 at the end of the second
        year. This number became 103 at the next report, and suddenly fell, Nov. 1,
        1878, to 51, when the minimum number was reached. Since that time the list
        has slowly increased until the present, when 65 working members are enrolled
        upon the books of the lodge. The present officers are William H. Bierce, W.
        C. T. ; Rev. John Sailor, W. C. ; Henry Marsh, P. W. C. T. In 1871 occurred
        the first regular annual meeting for the election of officers. The following
        gentlemen were chosen : President, A. S. Butler ; Treasurer, B. D. Pritch
        ard ; Corresponding Secretary, J. B. Humphrey ; Record ing Secretary, M. T.
        Ryan ; Librarian and Collector, H. C. Weeks; Executive Committee, J. W. Stone,
        E. Amsden, C. W. Hall. In July there were on the books 129 annual members
        and 4 life-members, Joseph Fisk and William B. Williams having been added
        to the latter class. The asso ciation gave a course of lectures in the fall
        and winter which netted nearly $400 profit. The lecturers were Will M. Carlson,
        E. B. Fairfield, B. F. Taylor, Rev. Mr. Milburn, the blind preacher, Fred.
        Douglass, Mrs. Mary A. Liver more, M. D. Wilber, Josh Billings, W. E. McLaren,
        and Theodore Tilton. The first meeting of the lodge was held in Odd-Fellows''
        Hall. After some changes in location the present hall, in the Union Block,
        was secured, and dedicated March 12, At the annual meeting in June, 1872,

        \ Allegan Bank was one of the celebrated wildcat in stitutions of over forty\
        \ years ago. It was organized in the fall of 1837, and issued its first paper\
        \ promises to pay near the close of that year, Alexander L. Ely being the\
        \ presi dent and Hovey K. Clarke the cashier. Its capital stock consisted\
        \ of real-estate mortgages. The banking-house was an upper room over a store\
        \ on Brady Street. The bills issued by the establishment not only passed readily\
        \ in the home market, but soon extended through a large part of the State.\
        \ The ready confidence of the credulous public was secured by a couple of\
        \ incidents of otherwise trivial importance. The library contains about 900\
        \ volumes, which, with book-cases and fixtures, is valued at about $2000.\
        \ Present officers : President, E. Amsden ; Vice-President, Mrs. Elizabeth\
        \ Booth; Clerk, Edwy C. Reid; Correspond ing Secretary, Mrs. O. T. Booth ;\
        \ Treasurer, H. B. Peck ; Librarian and Collector, Mrs. S. E. Bingham ; Executive\
        \ Committee, John M. Mendell, H. H. Pope, George W. Lonsbury, William W. Warner.\
        \ THE WOMAN'S LYCEUM. The Woman's History Class of Allegan was organized on\
        \ the 1st of February, 1875, with twenty ladies present. A leader, assistant\
        \ leader, and secretary were chosen, a com pact by which every member was\
        \ pledged to discharge all duties imposed by the vote of the class was signed,\
        \ and ap pointments were made for weekly meetings at the homes of the members.\
        \ Study began with the earliest known history of the world ; the mythology\
        \ of different nations followed*. This was succeeded by histories of Egypt,\
        \ Ph\u0153nicia, the Jews, Ethiopia, Carthage, the Punic wars, Persia, Assyria,\
        \ Lydia, Damascus, and Palmyra. Next followed the history of Greece, the battles\
        \ of Thermopyl\xE6, Salamis, Platea, and Mycale, the Peloponnesian wars, histories\
        \ of Macedonia, Sicily, Pontus, Armenia, Cappadotia, Rhodes, Bactria, Parthia,\
        \ and other lesser countries, interspersed with essays on various subjects,\
        \ readings from the poets, etc. Soon after the bills were issued a citizen\
        \ had occasion to use a small sum at the East. His Allegan money would not\
        \ answer, and the emergency admitted of no delay. He applied to the president\
        \ of the bank as a friend. The latter had a small sum in Eastern funds, which\
        \ he exchanged with him for Allegan bills. Rumor seized on the occurrence\
        \ and magnified the amount a hundredfold. Within a few days it was currently\
        \ reported and believed at Kalamazoo that the Allegan Bank redeemed its bills\
        \ in Eastern funds on demand at the counter. The news was soon prevalent in\
        \ all the settled parts of the State, and, as few or none of the Michigan\
        \ banks redeemed their bills, those of the Allegan Bank were eagerly sought\
        \ after. The other occurrence which gave the bank a high stand in\" was the\

        \ in WTatson had its begin ning as early as 1854, under the fostering care\
        \ of Elder Manchester, who first preached to the small flock in the Stone\
        \ school-house, on section 18. The members increased, and the need of a larger\
        \ and more permanent place of wor ship was felt. Under the spur of this need\
        \ an effort was made to erect a house of worship, which resulted in the present\
        \ frame edifice on section 23, built in 1856 by sub scription. The clergymen\
        \ in succession aster Elder Man chester have been Elders Daily, Deyo, and\

        \ a service each Sabbath, but the society has no stated pastor. The present\
        \ trustees are John Edgarton, Samuel Fisk, Nelson Fisk. The convocations of\

        \ Its object is the accumulation of a class of wholesome and entertaining\

        \ ST. MARY'S ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. In 1857 the first movement was begun which\
        \ later re sulted in the establishment of a permanent and successful Roman\
        \ Catholic society in Watson. In that year Father Labelle, of French descent,\
        \ made a pilgrimage to the town ship from Kalamazoo once in three months,\
        \ and ministered to the people, services having been held first at the house\
        \ of Daniel Bracelin, and subsequently at the houses of other residents. ORGANIZATION\
        \ In 1867 an effort was made to build a church, and so zealous were this people\
        \ to further the interests of the cause that several members of the congregation\
        \ secured a loan of $500 by mortgages on their farms, which three years later\
        \ were canceled. This amount, together with small sub scriptions and contributions\
        \ in labor and material, enabled them to build the present edifice on section\
        \ 8. The pastors in succession since Father Labelle's advent have been Father\
        \ Quinn, -Father Herwig, who remained three years, Father Seybold, and the\

        to Edinburgh in the beginning of the year 1700. His patron at once procured
        him employ ment in the Advocates'' Library : at the end of two years he was
        installed as assistant-librarian, and in 1730 was appointed chief librarian.
        His connection with this important office has received this honour able mention:
        "The learning and judgment, the activity and attention, which Ruddiman invariably
        exerted for the benefit of this institution during fifty years, have justly
        gained him the honour of being the second founder of the Advocates'' Library."
        He married, in 1701, Barbara ScoUay, daughter of the laird of Oatness in Orkney,
        who brought him a good connection, but little fortune. He joined an Episcopal
        congregation, whose meeting-house was in Gray''s Close. In December 1703,
        he agreed to pay forty- shiUings Scots for his seat during the two yrears.
        The situation of librarian offered many facilities, of which he availed himself;
        and his life was one of great industry in the literary world. For a few years
        he received sons of respectable families into his house, for their education.
        But with aU his efforts, his first years in the metropolis were not remunerative
        ; and, to increase his income, he as sumed, in 1707, the business of auctioneer,
        dealing chiefly in books. His industry in the more genial work, however, continued
        unabated ; and successive years added to his contributions to Uterature. The
        magistrates of Dundee, in 1710, invited Eud diman to become rector of the
        grammar-school there. The Faculty of Advocates were pressing in their desire
        that he should not accept the office, and at', 2]

        Library, at Washington, and later, Librarian at the Public Library, Boston.
        He was succeeded by Lafayette Burr, under whom the school went on prosperously
        something over two years. "In the spring of 1851, Dr. Nathan B. Cooke was
        elected to fill the place left vacant by Mr. Burr. Dr. Cooke was a doctor
        of medicine and a minister of the Baptist Society, but owing to an affection
        of the throat, he was obliged to give up preaching for a number of, years,
        during which time the Committee were so fortunate as to secure his services.
        A more faithful, thorough and interested teacher no school ever had. While
        it was under his charge a systematic plan of study was adopted. This, together
        with the fact that the school had increased greatly in numbers, rendered an
        assistant teacher necessary, and created a demand for more room. The Academy
        was therefore enlarged in 1852, and the school moved up stairs. The east end
        of the upper part had been separated from the main room by a partition and
        sliding doors, and was used for a recitation-room, and Mary W. Shepard was
        installed assistant. Not long after, a small sum of money was expended by
        the Committee for philosophical apparatus. For the space of nine years Dr.
        Cooke remained in the position. At the end of this time he removed to Newton,
        Mass., where he taught two years. While there he met Prof. Lewis Monroe, the
        elocutionist, who encouraged him to think that it was possible for him to
        resume preaching. It had always been a source of deep sorrow to him that he
        was debarred from following his chosen calling, and upon Professor Monroe''s
        decision he removed to Leicester, Mass., to take charge of a parish, and thence
        to Lonsdale, R. I., where he remained until his death in 1871. His remains
        were brought to Bristol, and laid in Juuiper Hill Cemetery. "Upon Mr. Cooke''s
        withdrawal in 1S60, Thomas W. Bicknell, of Bar rington, was elected to the
        office. He remained three years, and then left, to accept the principalship
        of one of the grammar schools of Provi dence. Henry S. Latham, a most accomplished
        scholar, succeeded him. At the end of four years, the Committee paid Mr. Bicknell
        the deserved compliment of asking him to become the principal of the school
        again. He accepted the invitation and remained two years. Mr. Bicknell received
        the office of Commissioner of Public Schools in 1809, which he retained several
        years. He is now editor of the New England Journal of Education. "In 1869,
        Frank G. Morley was chosen principal. Although young, he developed a remarkable
        ability for imparting information, and unusual talent for controlling the
        school. . . . For nearly six years he labored. At the end of this time his
        health failed, and he sent his resignation to the Committee to take effect
        at the end of the term. But so rapid were the inroads of disease that he was
        forced to leave soon after the middle. He went to Pittsfield, Mass;, where
        he died of consumption at the residence of his father, Rev. J. B. Morley,
        Aug. 1, 1875."', 2]

        to leave the town until his followers had resented this gross insult by presenting
        him with a thick coat of Tar and Feathers." In 1798 the first Public Library
        of the town was established. Subscribers for one hundred shares at five dollars
        a share were easily obtained, and a charter of incorporation was granted by
        the As- Furniture Warehouse of Mr. William H. Bell. sembly at its May session.
        Of the five hundred dollars orig- inally subscribed, three hundred were given
        by Ool. Simeon Potter, and one hundred and twenty-one by Capt. Charles De-
        Wolf. In grateful recognition of the liberality of the princi- pal donor,
        the association was called " The Potter Library Company." Its first meeting
        was held in the " Academy," Nov. 3, 1798. Nearly all of the money subscribed
        was at once invested in books, and a very excellent library was thus ob- tained
        (as a reference to its catalogue, now in the possession of the Librarian of
        the "Rogers Library" will show). Some rather singular rules were enforced
        respecting the circulation of the books. The time they might be held by a
        subscriber depended on their size, and when two or more persons applied at
        the same time for the same book, an auction was held, and the highest bidder
        carried it away. Yearly dues of twenty-five cents, to preserve and increase
        the library, were required from each member. Thomas Richmond was the first
        to hold the of- fice of Librarian and Treasurer: Joseph M. Blake succeeded
        him. The library was opened only on Saturday afternoons. The company was dissolved
        in 1837, and its property Avas di vided among those who then held its shares.
        The death of George Washington caused very deep grief among the people of
        Bristol. Several times he had visited the town, and his commanding presence

        the mausoleum, by lifting a frescoed curtain, but deceive no one who cares
        to consider how impossible it would be for them to perform this service, and
        caper so ignobly as they do at the same time. In fact this tomb of Ariosto
        shocks with its hideousness and levity. It stood formerly in the Church of
        San Benedetto, where it was erected shortly after the poet''s death, and it
        was brought to the Library by the French, when they turned the church into
        a barracks for their troops. The poet''s dust, therefore, rests here, where
        the worm, work ing silently through the vellum volumes on the shelves, feeds
        upon the immortality of many other poets. In the adjoining hall are the famed
        and precious manuscripts of Ariosto and of Tasso. A special application must
        be made to the librarian, in order to see the fragment of the Furioso in Ariosto''s
        hand, and the manuscript copy of the Gerusalemma, with the corrections by
        Tasso. There are some pages of Ariosto''s Satires, framed and glazed for the
        satisfaction of the less curious ; as well as a let ter of Tasso''s, written
        from the Hospital of St. Anna, which the poet sends to a friend, with twelve
        shirts, and in which he begs that his friend will have the shirts mended,

        \ the hall, when the collection, which now greatly exceeds 6,000 volumes,\
        \ was still comparatively in its infancy. Dr. Archibald Stevenson was the\

        \ by year the collection has gone on increasing in extent, and in literary\
        \ and scientific value. Opposite this church there was built the old Physicians'\
        \ Hall \u2014 the successor of the still more ancient one near the Cowgate\
        \ Port. The members of that college feued from the city a large area, extending\
        \ between the south side of George Street and Rose Street, on which they erected\
        \ a very handsome hall, with rooms and offices, from a design by Mr. Craig,\
        \ the architect of the new city itself. The two oldest names on the list of\
        \ Fellows admitted are Peter Kello, date December nth, 1682, and John Abernethy,\
        \ whose diploma is dated June 9th, 1683, granted at Orange, and admitted December\
        \ 4th, 1684, and a wonderful roll follows of names renowned in the annals\
        \ of medicine. The attempt to incorporate the prac titioners of medicine in\
        \ Scotland, for the purpose of raising alike the standard of their character\
        \ and acquirements, originated in 161 7, when James VI. issued an order in\
        \ Parliament for the establishment of a College of Physicians in Edinburgh\
        \ \u2014 an order which recites the evils suffered by the community from the\
        \ intrusion of unqualified practitioners. He further suggested that three\
        \ members of the pro posed college should yearly visit the apothecaries' shops,\
        \ and destroy all bad or insufficient drugs found therein; but the year 1630\
        \ came, and found only a renewal of the proposal for a college, referred to\
        \ the Privy Council by Charles I. But the civil war followed, and nothing\
        \ more was done till 1656, when Cromwell issued a patent, still ex tant, initiating\

        \ The foundation stone was laid by Professor Cullen, long a distinguished\
        \ ornament of the Edinburgh University, on the 27th November, 1775, after\
        \ a long discussion concerning two other sites offered by the city, one in\
        \ George Square, the other where now the Scott monument stands. In the stone\
        \ was placed a parchment containing the names of the then fellows, several\
        \ coins of 17 71, and a large silver medal. There was also another silver\

        \ being Professor of Humanity in the university for eight years, regarded\
        \ it promotion to leave it to take full charge of the High School ; and when\
        \ he died, in February, 1 630, his office was again con ferred upon a Professor\
        \ of Humanity, Thomas Crawford, who figured prominently amid the pageants\
        \ with which Charles I. was welcomed to the city in 1633, and with Hawthornden\
        \ and others composed and delivered some of the bombastic speeches on that\
        \ occasion. The roll was then called over, and each boy presented his offering.\
        \ When the latter was less than the quarterly fee no notice was taken of it,\
        \ but if it amounted to that sum the rector exclaimed with a loud voice, Vivat;\
        \ to twice the ordinary fee, Floreat bis; for a higher sum, Floreat ter; for\
        \ a guinea and upwards, Glorias ! The highest donor was named the Victor,\
        \ or King. The Council repeatedly issued injunctions against the levy of any\
        \ \" Bleis-sylver, or Bent sylver,\" but apparently in vain. The latter referred\
        \ to the money for collecting bent, or rushes, to lay down on the clay floor\
        \ to keep the feet warm and dry ; and so lately as the commencement of the\
        \ seventeenth century, during the summer season, the pupils had leave to go\
        \ forth with hooks to cut bent by the margins of Duddingston and the Burgh\
        \ lochs, or elsewhere. \" Happily,\" says Steven, of a later date, \" all\

        \ is regarded as a fair remuneration for their professional labour.\" In his\

        \ that though they had led him to expect \" 400 bairns at the least,\" he\
        \ had only 180 when he began office. But there is no authentic record of attendance\
        \ at that early period ; and it is curious that the abstract of the annual\

        that day what a solemn tranquillity brooded in the air ! what a hushed silence
        reigned on the earth, broken only, as morning woke up, by the voice of prayer
        and praise proceed ing from almost every house in the village ! The street
        door was never opened on that day except for the egress or ingress of church-goers.
        No traveller, no straggler, no children at play, were to be seen on the road,
        or running about the streets ; and he was considered to have committed a serious
        breach of duty who was seen walking in the fields on the Sabbath. Profane
        swearing was held in great abhorrence by us in those days, until the advance
        of intemperance, with this and every other horror in her train, made us familiar
        with that detestable vice. Surely Intemperance must have sat for her likeness
        when Milton drew the picture of Sin, the mother of Death, " fell portress
        at the gates of hell." We had a few religious and missionary magazines in
        circula tion amongst us at that time, but not a single cheap periodi cal.
        We had, indeed, great store of fairy tales, stories of giants, superstitious
        legends, and budgets of coarse wit and buffoonery, got up in the form of penny
        pamphlets of twenty four pages each, and dispersed everywhere by hawkers ;
        and where was the house which had not its well thumbed bunch of old ballads
        and songs lying on the window-seat, or some equally prominent place, to the
        special delectation of the young, who were sometimes guilty of giving them
        an undue preference over the Catechism, the Proverbs of Solomon, and even
        " Pilgrim''s Progress," which, with Watt''s Divine Songs for Children, and
        the Book, were seldom missing in the vil lager''s home, such being intended
        by him to supply the principal mental aliment of his children ? About the
        beginning of the present century, a number of our working-men, in conjunction
        with several of the neigh bouring farmers, and the village and parish schoolmasters,
        got up a subscription for a library. Funds sufficient for the purchase of
        several hundred volumes were speedily raised. The subscribers formed themselves
        into a society, binding themselves by printed rules, in which it was stated
        that the librarian must always be resident in the village,', 1]

        \ pride she mentioned how he had actually lifted her \"in his great strong\
        \ arms\" \u2014 to use her own expression \u2014 from her seat beside the\
        \ kitchen fire to her arm chair in the \"Sanctum.\" There is great expres\
        \ sion in the tones of her voice, a musical sweetness which shews a gentle\
        \ spirit and a fine ear. Never have we heard the pathetic or the humorous\
        \ in ballad poetry rendered with such happy effect as in the snatches which\
        \ she repeated of her own ballads or from the old minstrel lore. She is a\
        \ gentlewoman, in the true sense of that term, by instinct, or by a certain\
        \ delicacy of feeling, and by self-culture. Her ease, self possession, native\
        \ grace, and dignity, all so thoroughly natural and simple \u2014 in short,\
        \ her true womanliness \u2014 are qualities as remarkable, perhaps, as her\
        \ poetic genius. If we may be allowed the expression, she seems to have been\
        \ a born reader. She can scarcely remember the time when her love of books\
        \ was not her ruling passion. She had exhausted the village library before\
        \ she had entered her teens, ancl the astonished librarian, who had never\
        \ met with such an instance before, and who had no small pride in his collection\
        \ of books, was obliged to confess that she had fairly read him out \u2014\
        \ the Universal History and all ; expressing at the same time a fear that\
        \ she might read herself blind, a fear which has been but too painfully realised.\
        \ It was very amusing to hear her \" ain gudeman,\" John, telling with great\
        \ glee, how that after she had \" used up \" the village library,", 1]

        \ one arinful of books after another, and continued his journeys till this\
        \ other librarian was also compelled to acknowledge that he had never known\
        \ a case of such fell reading before. It is noteworthy that the first copies\
        \ of Milton's \" Paradise Lost,\" and of Allan Ramsay's Poetical Works, which\
        \ Janet saw, were on a weaver's loom. Referring to this treasure, which she\
        \ found in her eighth year, she very appropriately quoted the lines from one\
        \ of her poems, entitled \" A Wheen Aul' Memories \" \u2014 It was there my\
        \ young fancy first took to the wing ; It was there I first tasted the Helicon\

        \ desirous that her neighbours in the same walk of life should share in her\
        \ plea sure, and so she started a small circulating library, which, true to\
        \ poetic experience, turned out a losing concern. She had no lack of readers,\
        \ but they failed to return the volumes they took out, so that her library\
        \ was literally exhausted, for she lost all her books. It was a very praiseworthy\
        \ effort, however, which she made for the diffusion of knowledge. It was only\
        \ in connection with one book that any domestic duty was ever overlooked,\
        \ or any allotted task for the day not completed. Her confession on this subject\
        \ is memor able. \" Shakspeare,\" she said, \"was my first and only transgression\
        \ in connection with my domestic labour, and oh, Sir, need ye wonder at it\
        \ when I turned for the first time to his wondrous pages 1 I regard him as\

        \ of grammar, and her love of poetry at the same time, from the Bard of Avon.\
        \ On expressing to her our surprise that she could write so grammatically\

        \ It would be impossible, within any reasonable limits, to include the existing\
        \ generation, and hence the names of living persons are generally omitted.\
        \ The writer regrets that he cannot present here sketches of other ancient\
        \ and worthy families, such as the Andersons, Christians, Hamiltons, Kerrs,\
        \ McPheeterses, Millers, Pattersons, Pilsons, Walkers, etc. The genealogies\
        \ of several of the oldest and most distinguished families \u2014 Lewis, Preston,\
        \ Houston, etc. \u2014 are omitted, because they are given fully in other\

        was over 7,000, of deliveries 58,612, and of takers 3,519 (all to Nov. 15).
        Five years later there were 9,897 volumes; 1,094 were rebound in 1867, 93
        withdrawn, and 14 lost. Of borrow ers there was a list of 8,352, and from
        the beginning the de liveries amounted to 404,610. After annexation to Boston
        (1873) the library remained intact with its funds, in town where it belonged,
        and for this result Charlestown is much indebted to Dr. C. S. Cartel (librarian
        1870-85), and Hon. T. T. Sawyer. Soon afterwards it was established on the
        sec ond floor of the City Hall. The number of volumes Dec. 31, 1886, was 26,428,
        and of deliveries (1886) 65,977, while the funds had increased to $11,500,
        and the institution is flourish ing. There is one department, that ought to
        have precedence in every town library, for which the writer urged contributions.
        It is that of all publications relating to the place, to the natives and residents,
        or issued by them. No one can tell what local or personal information can
        or will be sometime wanted or needed, and in the town library this should
        be found. It is disheartening to see all the last novels in such a library,
        and no care for a copy of a memorial of one of the best old citi zens ; to
        find the popular comic author from far away repre sented, and not the books
        of a man who on the spot did good service long ago. Calls made on the public
        early in the sixties would, if in any general way responded to, have secured
        far more than they did. A little later the junk-dealer was very suc cessful.
        A single pamphlet from each of two hundred persons (when 3,500 freely took
        out books), would have made a collec tion that could be secured now only by
        great labor, if done by one person, as it now must be to become nearly the
        success then cheaply possible. Yet Charlestown, thanks to some good people,
        has come to have this department fairly supplied. No one need, however, to
        feel that there is not still room for more, no matter how old or obscure seems
        the book or the pamphlet. The Sunday Schools have libraries such as the differing
        ideas of the owners suggest. In the High School there is a fair and useful
        collection, and books are also gathered by various Soci eties and Lodges.',

        \ (entirely now of brick, 74 x 54 ft.) has probably been changed more than\
        \ any other in town that has not been altered for business, or that has been\
        \ constantly the residence of one family. It has been, indeed, although of\
        \ course on a small scale, more like many of the old English family homes,\
        \ plain but substantial, and without architectural character outside, but\
        \ quaint or pic turesque and very comfortable inside ; changed this way or\
        \ that, as use or convenience suggested, until it is evidently a growth and\
        \ not the result of a single contract. Bric-a-brac and curi osities from many\
        \ a country, besides books, and, still more, the charm of old associations,\
        \ make the rooms pleasant, and the group they form thoroughly home. The most\
        \ notable part is perhaps the private business-room of the writer, \u2014\
        \ large, oblong, rather old-worldish in aspect, with its red-beamed ceiling\
        \ and two shafted windows filled with stained glass. Like a good deal of the\
        \ house the growth of wants and circumstances, it is peculiarly his home-spot\
        \ made by himself, for he was his own architect, and then librarian to form,\
        \ book by book, a collection that gives the apartment com pleteness. Many\
        \ associations with those who have been in the house linger around, and the\
        \ books have many besides with their authors and scores of former notable\
        \ owners and dis persed libraries. Outside, the garden, though changed, is\
        \ still pleasant ; eight or ten of the trees, now grown very tall, are standing,\
        \ while it seems as if all the old human Charlestown were slowly passing away.\
        \ Still we and the good old home keep together, but the future tells us none\
        \ of its secrets. Farther northward, between School Street and Salem Street,\
        \ James Harrison bought (1799-1802) a large lot (114 ft. on Main St., 126\
        \ ft. on High St.) and built there a square wooden mansion, two stories high,\
        \ resembling the Dexter house, but plainer, without a cupola, and surrounded\
        \ by far less elaborate grounds. In front there was a lawn reaching to a slat\
        \ fence along Main Street, and there were a few trees for shade. At the rear\
        \ was a small orchard with a high, rough board fence, on High Street. Mr.\
        \ Harrison died in 1812. Somewhat later", 1]

        \ Founded Sep., 1851, it was after wards, for years, the owner of a considerable\
        \ Library of a popular nature, that was also, in time, dispersed. The earliest\
        \ practical attempt to establish a Public Library originated in a petition\

        arranging these documents, and, before he had completed his work, was appointed
        librarian at the Institute. Years sped along, and at length when in 1801 the
        First Consul concluded the Concordat, it became necessary to restore the churches,
        which had been turned into storehouses, to the clergy. As for the works they
        contained, they were distributed between the Senate, the Tribune, the Corps
        Legislatif, the library of the First Consul, etc. The Bastille papers seem,
        thanks to M. Ameilhon, to have been sent to the library of the Arsenal, where
        they were forgotten. When a person asked to consult them, the reply wTas that
        no one knew anything about them. This lasted until 1840, when M. Ravaisson,
        who was employed at the Arsenal, set to work to examine this mass of papers.
        Great was his surprise when putting his hand upon the lettres de cachet, he
        became convinced that he had discovered a lonp>lost treasure. The O Administrators
        of the library were at first somewhat astonished, but however they ended by
        encouraging M. Ravaisson, then quite a young man, to set the archives in order.
        This labour, as we have already mentioned, took M. Ravaisson twenty years,
        and he starts only from 1661. In fact there do not appear to have been any
        earlier records discovered. The first name to be found in the register of
        the Bastflle is that of the Marquis de la Sabloniere. We propose to make a

        \ residence by the Librarian. The famous manuscript, known as The Book of\
        \ Armagh, was presented to the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1858,\
        \ by Lord John George Beresford. It was purchased by Bishop Reeves, when Dean\
        \ of Armagh, for ,\xA3300, from Mr. William Brownlow, in 1853. It had been\
        \ in the possession of a family named MacMoyre for a very long period. Florence\
        \ MacMoyre, the last custodian, pledged it for \xA35 to pay the expenses of\
        \ a trip to England in 1680 He went there to give evidence against Oliver\
        \ Plunkett, Roman Catholic Primate, put to death for treason in 1681. MacMoyre\
        \ did not release the book, and it was secured by the father of William Brownlow,\
        \ some years afterward. Bishop Reeves says that the Book of Armagh \"was so\
        \ called because it was the most precious literary possession of the Church\
        \ of Armagh.\" He describes it as \" A small thick quarto, measuring in height,\
        \ 7J inches ; in breadth, 5 \\ ; and in thickness, 2_J ; consisting of 221\
        \ vellum leaves, on each side of which the writing appears in double columns.\
        \ The penmanship is of extreme elegance, and is admirable throughout for its\
        \ distinctness and uniformity. There is no date entered in the book, but the\
        \ scribe's name, Ferdomnach, appears in several parts of it ; we know from\
        \ the Ancient Irish Annals what was the period at which he lived. At the year\
        \ 845, is recorded ' the death of Ferdomnach, the wise and very admirable\
        \ scribe of Ardmagh.' Internal evidence proves that part of the volume, viz.,\
        \ that containing the Gospel of St. Matthew, was finished on the 21st September,\
        \ about 807. * * * The Manuscript, it may be briefly stated, contains the\
        \ following subjects : \u2014 The Acts of St. Patrick by Muirchu and Tirechan,\
        \ being the earliest memoirs of the Apostle of Ireland which have been preserved,\
        \ together with some important passages in Irish, which are among the oldest,\
        \ and are the fullest specimens of the language now in existence. These are\
        \ followed by the Confession of St. Patrick, purporting to be copied from\
        \ his autograph. The whole is in writing anterior to the year 807. The entire\
        \ New Testament in Latin, accompanied by the Prologues of St. Jerom and Pelagius,\
        \ and here and there illustrated by Irish glosses. 1 he version agrees in\
        \ the main with the Vulgate, but presents occa sional departures from it in\

        2nd of Nov., 1852, but the greater part of his life has been spent in Yorkshire.
        He has lived at Aysgarth in Wensleydale, Skipton, Pontefract, Dewsbury and
        Brighouse, at which latter town he has resided nearly twenty years. He here
        published in 1878 a volume of poems entitled " Hours of Pastime," mostly composed
        of temper ance pieces. In this good cause Mr. Lane is essentially a very useful
        man, always working against the evils of intoxicants, and helping to counteract
        its evils by writing temperance poems and tales to numerous journals, and
        by giving lectures and addresses to Young Men''s Societies, Mutual Improvement
        Associations and other bodies. He has given more than five hundred addresses
        on " Gospel Temperance," has been Hon. Librarian Bishop Auckland Y.M.C.A.,
        Superintendent Town Head Mission and School, Hon. President Brighouse Elocution
        and Debating Society, in addition to holding numberless other honourable,
        important and useful posts to promote this laudable work. He has received

        \ opposi tion from the librarian, who insisted that the order of Antonelli\

        \ was that the authorities of the Vatican were themselves preparing to publish\
        \ a thorough colla tion, and they did not wish the glory of the achievement\
        \ to pass away from Rome. Cardinal Mai began, indeed, to prepare an edition\

        \ the cardinal's death, under the learned editorship of Vercellone. There\
        \ was a rumour copied into the Edinburgh Review from Sir Charles Lyell's work\

        \ work by Pope Gregory XVI., on account of its variations from the Vulgate,\
        \ which had been solemnly sanctioned by the decrees of the Council of Trent\
        \ and the Church's claims to infallibility. It was further asserted that he\
        \ finally obtained permission to publish his edition on condition that he\
        \ inserted within brackets the celebrated text 1 John v. 7, which was wanting\
        \ in the manuscript. Whether this was true or not, it is certain that what\

        \ Sepulveda; although there is a somewhat obscure reference to it a few years\
        \ earlier in the correspondence of the Papal librarian Bombasius with Erasmus.\
        \ A Roman edition of the Septuagint portion based upon the Vatican MS. appeared\

        title of " Defender of the Faith," which has descended to the Protestant monarchs
        of England ever since, and is now inscribed on our coinage. Luther, several
        of whose manuscripts are in the Library, published a vigorous reply, in which
        he treated his royal opponent with scant ceremony. The author himself had
        no scruple in setting it aside when his personal passions were aroused. And
        Rome has put this inconsistent book beside the letters to Anne Boleyn, as
        it were in the pillory here for the condemnation of the world. But deeply
        interesting as were these literary curiosities, I soon turned from them and
        became engrossed with the priceless manuscript of the Greek Scriptures. I
        had very little time to inspect it, for I was afraid to exhaust the patience
        of the librarian. In appearance the manuscript is a quarto volume bound in
        red morocco ; each of the pages being about eleven inches long, and the same
        in breadth. This is the usual size of the greater number of ancient manuscripts,
        very few being in folio or octavo, and in this particular resembling printed
        books. Each page has three columns, containing seventeen or eighteen letters
        in a line. It is supposed that this arrangement of the writing was borrowed
        directly from the most primitive scrolls, whose leaves were joined together
        lengthwise, so that their contents always appeared in parallel columns, as
        we see in the papyrus rolls that have recently been discovered. This peculiarity
        in the two or three manuscripts which possess it, is regarded as a proof of
        their very high antiquity. The writing on almost every page is so clear and
        distinct that it can be read with the greatest ease. What astonishes one most
        is the admirable preserva tion of this Codex, notwithstanding that it must
        be nearly sixteen hundred years old. It has quite a fresh and recent look
        ; indeed many manuscripts not fifty years old look much more ancient. No one,

        Jonson, the correspondent of Selden and Usher, and Spelman and Camden, and
        the companion and librarian of Sir Robert Cotton and his son, wrote a curious
        poem which he entitled Iter Lancastrense, in 1636, that is to say five years
        after the death of Drayton, He was born at Newport in the Isle of Wight, about
        1592. In 1618 his ardent thirst for knowledge and improvement induced him
        to travel not only through parts of his own country, and of Wales and Scotland,
        but to extend his visit to Shetland, Greenland, and Russia, whence he was
        so long in coming back that he was supposed dead, and Mr. Anthony White made
        an elegy in memory of him. Returning to England, the parson-poet fell deeply
        in love, it would seem with more than one lady, and experienced the fickleness
        of the sex, but took sweet revenge in after years by writing to the husband
        of one of the ladies congratulatory verses on the anniversary* of his wedding-day.
        Mr. James made a personal examination of all the great libraries in England,
        public and private, so rendering the Church and the nation a great service.
        He appears to have arrived on a visit to Heywood Hall, in Lancashire, then
        inhabited by the ancient family of the same name, in 1636, and whilst enjoying
        the hospitality of that mansion to have made various excursions to different
        parts of this and the neighbouring counties, which he described in his poem,
        Iter Lancastrense. It belongs to a very rare class of literary antiquarian
        relics, every specimen of which has its value. It is from such sources as
        these that those minutiae of county history which are the most difficult to
        meet with are derived ; and it is a relief to turn to them from the dry',

        Museum, had sought the city one afternoon. A man of books and not a man of
        business, a pale student with a far-away look in his dreamy eyes, he was not
        the kind of man you would trust to make a clever bar gain on your behalf.
        His brother Henry, absent in Roumania, making a railway for Baird and Co.,
        the great contractors, made a serious mistake when he left the management
        of his monetary affairs at home to bookish James. Just before closing time,
        James Carrick presented himself at the paying-in counter of the Bank of Baigent,
        Coxon and Co., Lombard Street, where his own and his brother''s modest accounts
        were kept. He addressed himself to an undersized, sharp-nosed, foxy - haired
        young man. " I want to pay this draft in to Mr. Henry Carrick''s account,"
        he began ; " it is payable to my order." " But you can''t," replied the clerk,
        with that suavity which distinguishes his kind when having to do with a small
        customer. "You can''t; don''t you see it''s crossed ? " " What must I do,
        then ? " asked Carrick, who knew nothing as to the course he ought to take.
        " Why, pay it into your own, and draw a cheque for Mr. Henry Carrick." " But
        I haven''t a cheque with me." " I''ll give you a loose one," was the answer.
        The cheque was accordingly drawn, and the draft and cheque paid over. Now
        here was ah opportunity for borrowing forty pounds, such as had not occurred
        to the clerk in all the six years he had been in the Bank. He credited James
        Carrick with the draft, debited him with the cheque, and paid himself the
        forty pounds. James had no counterfoil to the cheque, Henry was abroad for
        an indefinite time, and the cheque there fore had been made to " bearer."
        Ail he had to do was to have the paid cheque put into the pocket of James''spass-book,

        and brae are clad in green, An'' scatter''d cowslips sweetly spring; Powers
        celestial, whose protection Ever guards the "virtuous fair, While in distant
        climes I wander, By Girvan''s fairy-haunted stream The birdies flit on wanton
        wing. Let my Mary ''be your care. This was written by Richard Gall (born in
        1776, died in 1801) and is contained in a post humous volume of poems by him
        published in 1819. This is contained in the fifth volume of the Museum, and
        by Stenhouse is attributed to Burns. It passed as a genuine production of
        the poet till 1870, when Mr. Christie, librarian of Dollar Institution, pointed
        out that it was taken, all but verbatim, from the Edinburgh Magazine and Review
        for 1774, "my Mary" being there, however, represented by '' '' Serena. " FAREWELL
        TO AYRSHIRE. Scenes of woe and scenes of pleasure, Scenes that former thoughts
        renew; Scenes of woe and scenes of pleasure, Now a sad and last adieu ! This,
        like the preceding, belongs to Richard Gall. In Dr. Currie''s edition it was
        attributed to Burns, but in Gilbert Burns''s edition its true authorship is
        stated. COULD AUGHT OF SONG. Could aught of song declare my pains, Could artful
        numbers move thee, The muse should tell, in labour''d strains, O Mary, how
        I love thee. EPITAPH ON HIS DAUGHTER. Here lies a rose, a budding rose, Blasted
        before its bloom, &c. Said by Johnson, in the fifth volume of the Museum,
        to be "written for this work by Robert Burns," and Stenhouse repeated the
        statement ; but in 1870 it was ascertained to be taken from the Edinburgh
        Magazine for 1774. See preceding note. Really an epitaph written by Shenstone
        on Miss Ann Powell, though given in various editions of Burns''s poems. THERE
        GROWS A BONNIE BRIER-BUSH. This well-known song is contained in the fifth
        volume of Johnson''s Scots Musical Museum. Stenhouse says of it : " This song,
        with the exception of a few lines, which are old, was written by Burns for
        the Museum." We do not believe Burns can be credited with it at all.. Stenhouse
        is not always to be trusted in such matters ; he asserts, for instance, that
        the next two songs here commented on are by THE CAPTIVE RIBBAND. Dear Myra,
        the captive ribband''s mine, ''Twas all my faithful love could gain ; And
        wuuld you ask me to resign The sole reward that crowns my pain? Contributed
        to the Museum by Burns and claimed as his by Stenhouse, but more pro bably
        lifted from some old magazine. See preceding notes. Burns, which is not the

        \ At that day, the word ' blase' was unknown ; men had not enough sentiment\
        \ for satiety. There was a kind of Bacchanalian fury in the life led by those\
        \ leaders of fashion, among whom Mr. Vernon was not the least distinguished\
        \ ; it was a day of deep drinking, of high play, of jovial reckless dissipation\u2014\
        \ of strong appetite for fun and riot \u2014 of four-in-hand coachmanship\
        \ \u2014 of prize-fighting \u2014 of a strange sort of barbarous manliness,\
        \ that strained every nerve of the constitution ; a race of life, in which\

        \ by a chaster taste than fell to the ordinary members of his class, was apparent\
        \ in Mr. Vernon's costume as well as air. In tricate folds of muslin, arranged\
        \ in prodigious bows and ends, formed the cravat, which Brummell had not yet\
        \ arisen to reform ; his hat, of a very peculiar shape, low at the crown and\
        \ broad at the brim, was worn with an air of devil-me-care defiance ; his\
        \ watchchain, gar nished with a profusion of rings and seals, hung low from\
        \ his white waistcoat ; and the adapta tion of his nankeen inexpressibles\
        \ to his well shaped limbs, was a masterpiece of art. His whole dress and\
        \ air was not what could pro perly be called foppish \u2014 it was rather\
        \ what at that time was called ' rakish.' Few could so closely approach vulgarity\
        \ without, being vulgar : oi that privileged few, Mr. 'Vernon was one of the\
        \ elect. Further on, and near the steps descending into the garden, stood\
        \ a man in an attitude of profound abstraction : his arms folded, his eyes\
        \ bent on the ground, his brows slightly contracted . his diess was a plain\
        \ black surtout, and pantaloons ofthe same colour ; something both in the\
        \ fashion of the dress, and still more in the face of the man, i bespoke the\
        \ foreigner. Sir Miles St. John was an accomplished person for that time of\
        \ day : he had made the i grand tour ; he had bought pictures and I statues\
        \ ; he spoke and wrote well in the : modern languages ; and being rich, hospitable,\
        \ social, and not adverse from the reputation of : a patron, lie had opened\
        \ his house freely lo the host of emigrants whom the French Revolution had\
        \ driven to our coasts. Olivier Dalibard, a man of considerable learning and\
        \ rare scientific attainments, had been tutor in the house of the : Marquis\
        \ de G , a French nobleman, known \u25A0 many years before to the old Baronet.\
        \ The I Marquis and his family had been among the first emigres at the outbreak\
        \ of the Revolution. The tutor had remained behind ; for at that time no danger\
        \ appeared to threaten those who pretended to no oilier aristocracy than that\
        \ of i letters. Contrary, as he said, with repentant 1 modesty, to his own\
        \ inclinations, he had compelled, not only for his own safety, but for I that\
        \ Oi bis friemls, to take some part in the ; subsequent events of the Revolution\

        \ Robespierre; the fall of that virtuous exterminator had he withdrawn from\

        \ save certain heads from the guillotine \u2014 among: two brothers of the\
        \ Marquis de G , i received with grateful welcome by his former patrons, who\
        \ readily pardoned his career of Jacobinism, from their belief in his excuses,\
        \ and their obligations to the services which that very career had enabled\
        \ him to render to their kindred. Olivier Dalibard had accompanied the Marquis\
        \ and his family in one of Ihe fre quent visits they paid to Laughton ; and\
        \ when the Marquis finally quitted England, and fixed his refuge at Vienna,\
        \ with some connections of his wife's, he felt a lively satisfaction at the\
        \ thought of leaving his friend honourably, if unambitiously, provided for,\
        \ as secretary and librarian to Sir Miles St. John. In fact, the scholar,\
        \ who possessed considerable powers of fascination, had won no less favour\
        \ with the English baronet than he had with the French dictator. He played\
        \ well both at chess and backgammon ; he was an extraordinary ac- ent ; he\
        \ had a variety of information upon all points, that rendered him more con\
        \ venient than any cyclop\xE6dia in Sir library ; and as he spoke both English\
        \ and Italian with a correctness and fluency ex tremely rare in a Frenchman,\
        \ he was of con siderable service in teaching languages I well as directing\
        \ the general literary education of) Sir Miles's favourite niece \u2014 whom\
        \ we shall take an early opportunity to describe at length. Nevertheless,\
        \ there had been one serious obstacle to Dalibard's acceptance of tl pointment\
        \ offered to him by Sir Miles. Dali bard had under his charge a young orphan\
        \ boy of some ten or twelve years old \u2014 a Sir Miles was not long in suspecting\
        \ to ! scholar's son. This child had come France with Dalibard, and (while\
        \ the Mai family were in London) remained under the eye and care of his guardian\
        \ or father, which ever was the true connection between the two. But this\
        \ superintendence became impossible, if Dalibard settled in Hampshire with\
        \ Sir St. John, and the boy remained in London; nor, though the generous old\
        \ gentleman \u2022 to pay for the child's schooling, n bard consent to part\
        \ with him. At last, the matter was arranged : the boy was invi Laughton on\
        \ a visit, and was =o '.. well mannered, that he became a favourite, and was\

        \ double the I I of the room, with a domed ceiling, and an embayed window\
        \ of such depth, that the recess almost formed a chamber in itself. But both\
        \ these c'r apartment corresponded exactly in point of decoration ; they had\
        \ the same small panelling, painted a very light green, which seemed almost\
        \ white by candle-light, each compartment wrought with an arabesque, inched\
        \ frieze and cornice ; they had the same high mantelpieces, ascending to the\
        \ ceiling, with the arms of St. John in bold They had, too, the same old-fashioned\
        \ and venerable furniture, draperies of thick figured velvet, with immense\
        \ chairs and to correspond, interspersed, it is true, with more modern and\
        \ commodious inventions of the upholsterer's art, in grave sluffed leather,\
        \ or lively chintz. Two windows, nearly as deep as that in the further division,\
        \ broke the outline of the former one, and helped to give regular and nooky\
        \ appearance to the apartment, which took all discomfort from its extent,\
        \ and furnished all convenience for soli tary study or detached flirtation.\
        \ With little respect for the carved work of the panels, the were covered\
        \ with pictures brought by Sir Miles from Italy ; here and there marble busts\

        \ well wilh that half- Italian mode of decoration which belongs to the period\
        \ of James the First. The shape of the chamber, in its divisions, lent itself\
        \ admirably to that friendly and sociable intermixture as amusements which\
        \ reconciles the tastes of young and old. In the first divi sion, near the\
        \ fire-place, Sir Miles, seated in his easy-chair, and sheltered from the\
        \ opening y a seven-fold tapestry screen, {was still at chess with his librarian.\
        \ At a little distance, a middle-aged gentleman, and three turbaned matrons,\
        \ were cutting in at whist \u2014 shilling points \u2014 with a half-crown\
        \ bet, optional, and not much ventured on. On tables, drawn into the recesses\
        \ of the windows, were the day's newspapers, Gilray's caricatures, the last\
        \ new publications, and such other ingenious sug gestions to chit-chat. And\
        \ round these I grouped those who had not yet found elsewhere their evening's\
        \ amusement ; two or three shy young clergymen, the parish doctor, four or\
        \ five squires, who felt great interest in politics, but dreamt of the extravagance\
        \ of taking in a daily paper, and who now, monopolizing all the journals they\
        \ could find, began fairly with the heroic resolution to skip nothing, from\
        \ the first advertisement to the printer's name. Amidst one of these groups,\
        \ Mainwaring had bashfully ensconced himse'f. In the further on, the chandelier,\
        \ suspended from the domed ceiling, threw its cheerful light over a large\
        \ circular table below, on which gli the ponderous tea-urn of massive silver,\
        \ with its usual accompaniments. Nor were wanting there, in addition to those\
        \ airy nothings, sliced infinitesimally, from a French roll, the more substantial,\

        \ the matrons, with a slight sprinkling of the bolder young gentlemen who\
        \ had been taught to please the fair. The warmth of the evening allowed the\
        \ upper casement to be opened and the curtains drawn aside, and the July moon\
        \ light feebly struggled against the blaze of the lights within. At this table\
        \ it was Miss Clavering's obvious duty to preside ; but that was a complaisance\
        \ to which she rarely con descended. Nevertheless, she had her own way of\
        \ doing the honours of her uncle's house, which war, not without courtesy\
        \ and grace : to glide from one to the other, exchange a sew friendly words,\

        \ neglect, or be neglected by the rest, was her ordinary, and not unpopular\
        \ mode of welcoming the guests at Laughton \u2014 -not unpopular, for she\

        \ the circuit, or wandering artist, accompanied any of the neighbours, to\

        \ He avoided all \u25A0 conferences with Lucretia. She did not provoke them.\

        \ and scalding the children, or, what he loved dearly, setting two gossips\
        \ by the ears. But these occupations were over by the hour Lucretia left her\
        \ apart ment. From that time he never left her i view : and, when encouraged\
        \ to join her at his usual privileged times, whether in the gardens at sunset,\
        \ or in her evening niche in the drawing room, he was sleek, silken, and caressing\
        \ as Cupid, after plaguing the Nymphs, at the feet of Psyche. These two strange\
        \ persons had indeed apparently that sort of sentimental familiarity which\

        \ the most docile obedience, con cealed horror and hate, and something of\
        \ the ferocity of revenge. And if young Varney loved any one on earth except\
        \ himself, it was Lucretia Clavering. She had administered to his ruling passions,\
        \ which were for effect and display ; she had devised the dress which set\

        \ attention of the City Council in so warm a climate was the erection of public\
        \ baths; an application was received from a private person in November 1843\
        \ for permission to establish swimming baths on the Yarra opposite the Custom\
        \ House; and towards the close of the following January the first public baths\
        \ of Victoria were thrown open to the people free of charge for two days.\
        \ But in spite of that liberal effort to attract custom the venture did not\
        \ thrive ; the citizens of Melbourne preferred to pay their half-crown each\
        \ for a place in Fred. Liardet's omnibus, which took them down to the clean\
        \ crisp sand of the sea beach at Sandridge, where a dip in the sparkling brine\
        \ was more to their taste. So the baths were abandoned a year or two after.\
        \ There were few of the institutions of a great city which Melbourne did not\
        \ possess before the end of 1847. First in order came the School of Arts and\
        \ Mechanics' Institute, founded in November 1839, whilst the town was yet\
        \ very young. Its president was Captain Lonsdale, its vice-presidents the\
        \ Rev. J. Clow and Dr. Farquhar M'Crae, and among the committee were Redmond\
        \ Barry, John Caulfield, D. C. Macarthur, George Beaver, J. M. Chisholm, and\
        \ Thomas Strode. The Rev. T. H. Osborne acted as honorary secretary, and Thomas\
        \ Burns undertook the duties of librarian, while Dr. Wilkie volunteered for\
        \ the task of gathering and arranging our first museum, which was to be connected\
        \ with the little institution. A temporary wooden building was erected in\
        \ the beginning of 1S40, and on the 16th of April in that year the inaugural\
        \ address was delivered in it. In it also throughout that winter there was\
        \ given a course of lectures by some of the professional men of the town.\
        \ The first was delivered by Redmond Barry. This lively young Irish barrister,\
        \ having found it difficult to make a start in Dublin, had emigrated to Australia.\
        \ On landing in Sydney he was admitted to the bar there, and hearing of the\
        \ flourishing place that was growing up at Port Phillip he had taken his passage\
        \ for Melbourne, where he arrived on the 13th of November 1839, a day always\
        \ afterwards kept sacred by him in hospitable fashion as the luckiest day\
        \ of his life. Only a few months after his arrival he commenced his public\
        \ career in the colony by giving the first lecture of the new Mechanics' Institute,\
        \ his subject being the \" Art of Agriculture.\" How he came to be an authority\
        \ upon that art it is difficult to say, but it was certainly a very useful\
        \ subject for a young community. He first of all offered a quarter of an hour\
        \ of speculations as to the kind of agriculture carried on by Adam and Eve\
        \ in the Garden of Eden. Having exhausted that topic he spent an hour in an\
        \ elaborate disquisition on the agriculture of the ancients, with cheerful\
        \ extracts from Strabo and Virgil. To the end there was nothing said about\
        \ the agriculture of modern days, but an eloquent exhortation was given to\
        \ those present to study this useful art, and in conclusion the lecturer,\
        \ warmly complimenting his audience on the country that had fallen to their\
        \ lot, prophesied for it a great and prosperous future. Next month there came\
        \ a lecture on colonisation, and in June one by that youthful journalist,\
        \ Mr. Arden, on the \" Mechanical Agency of the Press,\" and in the following\
        \ month the citizens of Melbourne gathered to hear the intrepid explorer,\
        \ Captain Sturt, who was then on a visit from Adelaide, deliver a lecture\
        \ on \" Australian Geography and Geology.\" And so from month to month until\
        \ October the citizens of Melbourne gathered to hear the first culture-lectures\
        \ of the town. The institution throve, and in 1841 it had 241 members. The\
        \ committee then purchased that piece of land in Collins-street where now\
        \ the Athen\xE6um stands, the same institution, but under a different name.\
        \ On that site in 1842 a stone building was erected, which, though poor enough\

        \ Two acres of land stretching from Swanston-street to Russell-street were\
        \ granted for the purpose, and a commencement was made. Mr. Reed, the architect,\
        \ drew the plans for a magnificent pile of buildings, to cover almost all\
        \ the two acres, with four handsome fronts and a grand cupola rising high\
        \ from the centre. A million and more of money would be required to complete\
        \ the plan; ten thousand was granted, and next year ten thousand more; but\
        \ it was only a small corner that could be built with these sums. It was,\
        \ however, characteristic of the colony in those days not to raise small places\
        \ for immediate needs, that would have to be destroyed as progress went on,\
        \ but rather to draw out an extensive scheme, complete a small portion, and\
        \ leave the rest to be added piece by piece, but all on some grand and harmonious\

        \ was the actual originator. What was merely a passing suggestion with Childers\

        \ with ardour for all the remaining twenty-six years of his life. Latrobe\
        \ also was most friendly to the idea, and would have lent it substantial assistance,\

        \ worked his little vessel out of Western Port, and turned his course towards\
        \ Sydney. He commenced to make a careful survey of the coast towards Wilson's\
        \ Promontory; but, when only twenty miles were finished, he grew impatient\
        \ at the baffling weather, and ran as smartly as he could for Port Jackson.\
        \ Here ended the labours of Lieutenant Grant upon the shores of Victoria.\
        \ His name will always be remembered in our history, with which it is inseparably\
        \ connected ; but his position was by no means a great one. He did his month's\
        \ work ever)- month for his month's pay, and showed no particular zeal, nor\
        \ any notable enterprise in pursuing the duty he undertook. He had splendid\
        \ opportunities of doing original work \u2014 such as would have fired a Cook\
        \ or a Flinders to famous researches \u2014 but he let them slip. He thought\
        \ that his chances of promotion were small if he stayed in the colonies. A\
        \ better-paid position, with less trouble attached to it, was more suited\
        \ to his inclination ; and so, after a month or two of exploring near the\
        \ mouth of the Hunter River, he resigned his command, and took his passage\
        \ for London, where he immediately made a claim for \xA390 as recompense for\
        \ his extra labours and some small losses he had incurred. He received his\
        \ money, published his story of his voyage and his account of the behaviour\
        \ of vessels with sliding-keels, and so disappears from history. Governor\
        \ King reported of him that he was a \" sober, steady, capable officer,\"\
        \ but without any knowledge of \" surveying and delineation.\" Let us be glad\
        \ that he received the promotion he so ardently longed for. The Lady Nelson\
        \ now passed under the command of Murray, who had been a lieutenant on board\
        \ H.M.S- Porpoise, and the first use made of her was to carry on the survey\
        \ of Bass's Straits. Governor King had reported to the Duke of Portland that\
        \ Western Port was a place eminently suitable for the formation of a settlement,\
        \ but he did not know whether there might not be a better, and he wished to\
        \ have some important points cleared up about Western Port itself before taking\
        \ on himself the responsibility of advising the sending of a convict fleet\
        \ thither. Accordingly, on the 12th November, 1801, the little vessel left\
        \ Sydney on her third voyage of discovery,7 and on the 6th of December reached\
        \ the entrance to Western Port, which was entered the following morning. The\
        \ vessel cast anchor at the mouth of the streamlet now known as Bass's River.\
        \ On ascending it, the rich verdure of the banks, and the picturesque reaches\
        \ of the stream, made even more impression than on the first visit. Next day\
        \ Murray went ashore to look at the garden on Churchill Island. The wheat\
        \ was waving 6 feet high, with stalks like young sugar-canes ; the onions\
        \ and other plants were flourishing, but the potatoes had been rooted up by\
        \ wild animals. Murray, though surprised by the luxuriance of the growth,\
        \ was not inclined to take so sanguine a view of the place as Grant did. He\
        \ considered that in the main the soil was too poor and sandy to repay a settler\
        \ for the toil of actual cultivation.8 After a second careful examination\
        \ of the port, Murray prepared to execute the remainder of his commission\
        \ in regard to a survey of Bass's Straits. The winds being rarely favourable\
        \ for sailing out of the long and narrow channel that formed the entrance\
        \ to the port, he was forced to ' The authority for this voyage is the log-book\

  - - ["Coventry Patmore. 59 the fatal too-much. This air of perfect sincerity and\
        \ frankness, combined with the most manly self-restraint, marks off his work,\
        \ and sufficiently distinguishes it from that of those poets who are often\
        \ very fine and very touching, but sometimes also inclined to be effusive,\
        \ if not even \"gushing.\" A pervading simplicity and dignity are everywhere\
        \ present in the poetry of our subject. The tone of Mr Coventry Patmore's\
        \ work is essentially English. If he paint a bit of landscape, it reminds\
        \ you of Constable \u2014 a church-tower peeping through a screen of trees,\
        \ with its vane golden in the sun-light ; an old mansion, mellowed by age,\
        \ with its angularities all subdued, its walls ivy-clad, and its lawns and\
        \ patriarchal trees gathered round it ; and the life-stories associated with\
        \ it give a colour to it, and, as it were, a pathetic radiancy in his eyes.\
        \ There is nothing wild or outri mhis landscape \u2014 he affects rather the\
        \ phases in which nature con fesses the softening and subduing hand of man.\
        \ But he is an admirable landscape painter, and presents a picture with a\
        \ few gentle touches. As a metrist he has few equals. With him the poet's\
        \ craft has heen a serious and continuous study ; and he illustrates in his\
        \ practice the principles that he has adopted, with no affectation or mannerism,\
        \ but with a soft and gentle flow that carries the reader along with a sense\
        \ as of a delightful under-song. To one of the later editions of the \"Angel\
        \ in the House,\" he prefixed an essay on metrical law, which em bodies the\
        \ results of his thought and experience ; and it would do many a poetical\
        \ aspirant good to study that essay, as showing how much labour and mental\
        \ effort are needed to perfect the technical instruments, which a successful\
        \ poet employs to gain his results. The manner, too, in which the poet has\
        \ laboriously revised, corrected, and arranged and re-arranged his poems,\
        \ shows ho%v assiduous and open to criticism \u2014 above all to self-criticism\
        \ \u2014 must be the poet who is resolved to reach the highest level of excellence\
        \ possible. This will, in some degree, come out in our biographical outline\
        \ to follow ; but we must not omit to make mention here of the \" Florilegium\
        \ Amantis \" \u2014 a volume of extracts from all the works, issued some years\
        \ ago under the judicious and tasteful editorship of Dr. Richard Garnett,\
        \ of the British Museum. It is a choice and lovely bouquet, from a rare and\
        \ well-filled garden ; and suffices to give a very good idea of the poetic\
        \ work as a whole. Coventry Kearsey Dighton Patmore (he has practically discarded\
        \ the two middle names) saw the light at Woodford, in Essex, on July 2nd,\
        \ 1823, so that he is now in his 66th year. In person he is tall, still stiaight\
        \ and fresh, and bears no very visible marks of years ; gracefully courteous,\
        \ and dignified in manner. He is the son of the late P. G. Patmore, a successful\
        \ literary man, who is still remembered as the author of \"Literary Reminiscences,\"\
        \ and also as the sometime Editor of Colburn's \"New Monthly Magazine,\" to\
        \ which he largely contributed. Mr Coventry Patmore was thus reared in the\
        \ congenial atmosphere of literary life from the first. In 1844, that is,\
        \ when he was only twenty-one, he published bis first volume of ' ' Poems,\"\
        \ a work which indicated the finest perception, and, to the eyes of the discerning,\
        \ held out the promise which after years were so amply to fulfil. The opening\
        \ piece, \"The River,\" is especially finished and musical. In 1846 he was\
        \ appointed one of the assistant librarians of the British Museum ; and was\
        \ associated with the leaders of the pre-Raphaelite movement so far as to\
        \ contribute several pieces to \"the Germ.\" In 1853, his volume titled \"\
        Tamerton Church Tower, and other Poems\" was published, and, in the", 1]

        \ He is not a great thinker ; in reading his poetry one never starts \" resolved\
        \ on noble things.\" He is not of the Immortals ; few poets of this century\
        \ are. All the same, we need not swerve in our loyalty to Tennyson and Browning\
        \ in extending a hand of cordial welcome to Edmund Gosse. The work of the\
        \ humbler poet deserves our gratitude as well as that of the grand old masters.\
        \ Such songs have power to quiet The restless pulse of care, And come like\
        \ the benediction That follows after prayer. It must not be forgotten that\
        \ Mr. Gosse is primarily a critic and literary historian. Poetry with him\
        \ is but a pastime. The labours of the critic over shadow those of the poet.\
        \ He has discussed the literatures of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and\
        \ Holland, in \" Studies in the Literature of Northern Europe \" (1879) ;\
        \ he has written critical biographies of, inter aha, Lodge, Webster, Herrick,\
        \ Crashaw, Cowley, Etheredge, and Otway, in \"Seventeenth Century Studies\"\
        \ (1883). In 1885 he published the first course of lectures which he had delivered\
        \ as Clark Lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, under the comprehen sive\
        \ title of \" From Shakespeare to Pope : An enquiry into the causes and phenomena\
        \ of the rise of Classical Poetry in England.\" Long afterwards the book was\
        \ reviewed by Mr. Churton Collins in the Quarterly Review, and \u2014 to use\
        \ a phrase well known to literary workers \u2014 -was \"slated\" unmercifully.\
        \ The review would probably have fallen dead-born had not an evening paper\
        \ seen fit to take the matter up and to raise a controversy. A heated discussion\
        \ ensued, in which the spretcc injuria form\u0153 and many professions of\
        \ a desire to keep up the dignity of English letters were incongruously mixed\
        \ up. Mr. Gosse has recently published a \"History of Eighteenth Century Literature.\"\
        \ As a literary historian he excels in the picturesque presentment of facts,\
        \ in luminous criticism, and in the very rare power which he possesses of\
        \ stimulating and keeping up the reader's interest. The main facts of his\
        \ life are briefly these. Edmund William Gosse, the only son of the late Philip\
        \ Henry Gosse, the naturalist, was born in London on the 21st of September,\
        \ 1S49. For some years he acted as Assistant Librarian at the British Museum\
        \ ; but in 1875 he became Translator to the Board of Trade, a post which he\
        \ still holds. His principal poetical works are \"Madrigals, Songs, and Sonnets,\"\
        \ written in conjunction with John Arthur Blaikie, 1870; \" On Viol and Flute,\"\
        \ 1873 ; \" King Erik,\" a tragedy, 1876 ; \"The Unknown Lover,\" a drama,\
        \ 1878; \"New Poems,\" 1879; \"The Masque of Painters,\" 18S5 ; and \" Firdausi\
        \ in Exile, and other Poems,\" 1886. He has written three monographs \u2014\
        \ \" Gray \" (\" English Men of Letters \"series) ; \" Raleigh \"(\" English\
        \ Worthies \") ; and \" Congreve \" (\" Great Writers \"). He also edits the\
        \ best edition of Gray's works. He married in 1875. In 1885 he succeeded Mr.\
        \ Leslie Stephen as Clark Lecturer in English Literature at Trinity College,\
        \ Cambridge, being at the same time made an honorary M.A. of that University.\

        \ still.\" Jane wondered whether they could be those she had sent. She asked\
        \ to see them, and he brought them forward; three. They were the same. \"\
        \ I will take them away with me,\" said Jane. The librarian hesitated at this\u2014\
        \ not unnaturally. \"You will pardon me, I am sure, ma'am, if I inquire by\
        \ what authority you would take them ? Miss Beauchamp may call for them yet.\"\

        \ the letters and showing him the signature. \"And,\" she added, taking out\
        \ her card-case and handing him a card, \" that will prove that I am Jane\
        \ Chesney.\" The librarian bowed ; and intimated that her ladyship was of\
        \ course at liberty to do what she pleased with her own letters. \" Upon second\
        \ thoughts, I will leave this one, the last written, and write upon it our\
        \ present address,\" said Jane. \"As you observe, Miss Beauchamp may yet call\
        \ here.\" Obtaining the address of the two families in which she was told\
        \ Miss Beauchamp had served, Lady Jane quitted the shop, and walked on to\
        \ Gloucester Terrace, ordering the carriage to follow her by-and-by. She reached\
        \ the house occupied by the Lortons first, and inquired of a showy footman\
        \ whether Mrs. Lorton was at home. The answer was given in the affirmative,\
        \ but with some hesitation : it was earlier than the orthodox hour for receiving\
        \ visitors, and the man probably doubted whether his mistress was presentable.\
        \ Jane was shown into an excessively smart room, and after some delay an excessively\
        \ smart lady came to her ; but neither room nor lady possessed anything of\
        \ refinement. Jane had not given her name. \" It is of no consequence : I\
        \ am a stranger,\" she said to the servant when he inquired. Mrs. Lorton dropped\
        \ Jane a swimming curtsey, and sailing to a large velvet ottoman in the middle\
        \ of the room, took her seat upon it. Jane looked, as she ever did, a lady,\
        \ and Mrs. Lorton was all smiles and suavity. \" I have called to inquire\
        \ if you can kindly give me any informa tion as to the present address of\
        \ a young lady who lived with you as governess,\" began Jane. \" A Miss Beauchamp.\"\
        \ Mrs. Lorton's smiles froze at the question. \" I know nothing about Miss\
        \ Beauchamp,\" she answered, somewhat rudely. \" She did not behave well in\
        \ my house, and it was a good riddance when she left it.\" \" Not behave well\

        \ them : and this alteration of the meaning of the word has given birth to\
        \ a mistake as to the primary purpose of the classification, as if it had\
        \ been designed especially to part off the inferior epic productions from\
        \ Homer. But while some critics are disposed to distinguish the cyclic poets\
        \ too pointedly from Homer, I conceive that Welcker goes too much into the\
        \ other extreme, and identifies the cycle too closely with Relation of that\
        \ poet. He construes it as a classification delibe cycleIto rately framed\
        \ to comprise all the various productions Homer. 0f the Homeric epic, with\
        \ its unity of action and com parative paucity both of persons and adventures\
        \ \u2014 as opposed to the Hesiodic epic, crowded with separate persons and\
        \ pedigrees, and destitute of central action as well as of closing catastrophe.\
        \ This opinion does indeed coincide to a great degree with the fact, inasmuch\
        \ as few of the Hesiodic epics appear to have been included in the Cycle.\
        \ To say that none were included, would be too much, for we cannot venture\
        \ to set aside either the Theogony or the \xC6gimius ; but we may account\
        \ for their absence perfectly well without supposing any design to exclude\
        \ them, for it is obvious that their rambling character (like that of the\
        \ Metamorphoses of Ovid) forbade the possibility of interweaving them in any\
        \ continuous series. Continuity in the series of narrated events, coupled\
        \ with a certain degree of antiquity in the poems, being the principle on\
        \ which the arrangement called the Epic Cycle was based, the Hesiodic poems\
        \ generally were excluded, not from any preconceived intention, but because\
        \ they could not be brought into harmony with such orderly reading. What were\
        \ the particular poems which it comprised, we cannot now determine with exactness.\
        \ Welcker arranges them as fol- lows : \u2014 Titanomachia, Danais, Amazonia\

        \ of Troy, Returns of the Heroes, Odyssey, and Telegonia. Wuellner, Lange,\
        \ and Mr. Fynes nevertheless it would be correct to say that the poems were\
        \ arranged in series upon this principle and upon no other, The librarians\
        \ might have arranged in like manner the vast mass of tragedies in their possession\
        \ (if they had chosen to do so) upon the principle of sequence in the subjects\
        \ : had they done so the series would have formed a Tragic Cycle.", 1]

        \ books kept in excellent order, ready to the hand of the librarian, an exceedingly\
        \ courteous and well-informed gentleman, who, upon learning who and of what\
        \ nation I was, also my errand to the place, made himself of great use, enabling\

        \ catalogues of titles served to show that the volumes had been se lected\
        \ with unusual discrimination, involving a knowledge of English literature\
        \ by no means of ordinary scope. In all these libraries are to be found the\
        \ best writings of celebrated authors, especially of those writers who flourished\
        \ during the last century and the first half of this. The fact that the volumes,\
        \ although well taken care of, bear evidence of continual use, says much for\
        \ the diligence of the people in the matter of seeking after the best sort\

        extrava gant in the use of what may well be called truly loyal adjectives,
        as witness the following selection, culled at random from page after page
        of glowing narrative, in which the prince is described as " affable," "bluff,"
        "civil," "condescending," "conspicuous," "dignified," " frank," " gallant

        "humble," "liberal," "pleasing," "polite," " princely," " serene," striking,"
        " urbane," " victorious," with all of which the other parts of speech patriotically,
        enthusiastically, and unanimously agree. A greater man than prince or king,
        who hap pened to follow humbly in the suite of his royal master, receives
        but a passing notice, to wit : " Captain Nelson, of the Boreas, accompanied
        His Royal High- ness." Antigua, at one time, was compensated for the short
        plague of Parks by the presence of the Right Honorable Ralph Lord Laving ton,
        Baron of Lavington, " a very hospitable man and fond of splendor. His balls
        and routs were given upon a scale of the grand est and most impressive magnificence.
        His hospitality was tempered by the regard due to a personage of his importance,

        capacity of the black man. He would not, upon any occasion, receive a letter
        or parcel from the fingers of a black or colored man, and, in order to guard
        against such horrible defilement, he had a golden instrument wrought, something

        are able to secure the presence of the Librarian or one of the Fellows of
        the College. The most famous of these literary treasures are exhibited in
        cases which stand on the floor of the great library, and among these the highest
        place is held by the Book of Kells. This is one of the finest MSS. in Europe,
        and as a specimen of Irish illumination and writing has no rival. It dates
        from the time when Ireland, under the name of Scotia, was famous throughout
        Europe for her schools and for her missionary enterprise. It was the product
        of the age which sent Columba to Iona, Cuth- bert to England, and Columbanus
        to Gaul. It is a copy of the Gospels, and takes its name from the fact that
        it once belonged to the monastery at Kells in Meath. The date has to be fixed
        by internal evidence, and the best authorities now lean to the view that it
        was written about the end of the sixth century. The Irish Annals re- cord
        that in the year 1006 it was stolen from the church at Kells, that it was
        famous for its cover, and that it was found after forty nights and two months,
        Part of an Illuminated Monogram, from the Book of Kells. ''after its gold
        had been taken from it, and with sods over it.'' The monastery of Kells became
        Crown property in 1539, and the great MS. fell into the hands of Gerald Plunket
        of Dublin. In the seventeenth century Usher became its owner, and with his
        other books, in 1661, it found a permanent and safe home where it has since
        dwelt. To it, as to so many of its brethren, time and the binder have proved
        cruel foes. Although it still contains 344 folios, it has lost leaves at both
        the beginning and end ; and when, in the early part of this century, it was
        rebound, the margins', 1]
    - ['IRISH PICTURES. 30 Mark, Luke, John; Epistles of Paul, including that to the
        Laodiceans, with prefaces, chiefly by Pelagius ; Acts of Apostles ; and Life
        of St. Martin of Tours by Sulpicius Severus. Some of the pages are much rubbed,
        as if frequently exposed or touched, probably for the purpose of swearing.''1
        There are very interesting specimens to be seen here of other classes of MSS.
        Standing highest in general interest are those belonging to the Greek Testament.
        The Library possesses a valuable palimpsest, known as the Codex Rescriptus
        Dudlinensis ; it has been carefully edited by the present librarian, the Rev.
        T. K. Abbott. It is a small quarto volume, 8^ inches by 6, consisting of no
        folios. It contains considerable portions of St. Matthew''s Gospel, and its
        readings- possess a very high critical value. It dates in all probability
        from the fifth century, and is known in the lists of authorities by the letter
        Z. Any one who wishes to appreciate Dr. Abbott''s labours, and the enormous
        difficulty of much of the work done on behalf of recent New Testament scholarship
        by such men as Tischendorf and Tregelles, should inspect this MS. They will
        find it extremely difficult even to see, to say nothing of deciphering, the
        dim Greek uncial letters that were nearly obliterated many centuries ago,
        to make way for the later and less valuable writing placed over it. The Library
        also possesses a much later MS. that has been rendered famous by a fortuitous
        event in Greek Testament controversy. It is well known that Erasmus omitted
        from the first edition of his Greek Testament the words in i John v. 7, 8,
        translated in our A.V., '' In heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost
        : and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth.''
        When attacked for so doing, he promised that if a single Greek MS. could be
        found containing the words he would then insert them. They were at last found
        in a Greek MS., written in the cursive or running hand, of late date and very
        doubtful authority. This MS., known as the Codex Monfortianus, is also carefully
        kept in the Manu script Room. Erasmus, true to his promise, although he did
        not believe the words to be genuine, inserted them in his third edition. The
        Revised Version omits them, as resting upon altogether insufficient authority.
        But it is high time we left the Library for a stroll through the College itself.
        The various departments of learning are all adequately housed within its very
        extensive precincts ; the medical school being especially fortunate in this
        respect. The chemical lecture room and laboratory are splendidly equipped
        with all the latest and best facilities both for lecturing and prac tical
        work. The college park is also a very pleasant place of resort, and on the
        occasion of a University Cricket Match or Athletic Sports is thronged with
        the fashion and beauty of Dublin. Across the street, and opposite to the north-west

        \ father Fulk being raised to the dignity of King of Jerusalem, in 1 124;\
        \ but the marriage was not a happy one. Matilda bore three sons, Henry II.,\
        \ Geoffrey, and William. To secure the succession to his own line, the king\
        \ summoned a great council at Oxford, and made the nobles swear fealty to\
        \ Matilda again, and to his grandson Henry. The death of William Clinton,\
        \ at Alost, in 1128, relieved Henry I. from the apprehen sions and troubles\
        \ to which he had hitherto been subjected: but he did not live Death of long\
        \ to enjoy his repose. He visited Normandy in 1135; and there, at Rouen, Henry\
        \ I. having eaten to excess of a dish of lampreys, of which he was very fond,\
        \ he died on the 1st of December, 1135, in the sixty-seventh year of his age,\
        \ and thirty-sixth of his reign. The following character of this king by a\
        \ late historian seems to portray him with sufficient impartiality. \" Henry\
        \ I. was a monarch of superior ability ; the Conqueror alone of his family\
        \ equalled him in talent. He showed great spirit in his dealings with the\
        \ Church; he caused justice to be rigidly executed. 'A good man was he, and\
        \ mickle dread was there of him,' says the Saxon Chronicle. ' Peace made he\
        \ for man and beast: whoso bare his burthen of gold and silver, no man durst\
        \ say to him aught but good.' But he set at nought his char ters and his promises,\
        \ and he taxed his people without mercy; he increased the rigour of the forest\
        \ laws, and enlarged the forests; he punished him who killed a stag as him\
        \ character of who murdered a man; the herdsmen's dogs near the forests were\
        \ lamed ; men Henry I. were even in some cases prohibited from hunting on\
        \ their own lands, a great grievance in those days. Henry was more addicted\
        \ to literature than was usual among princes and nobles at that time, whence\
        \ he obtained the appellation of Beauclerc, or Fine Scholar. His treatment\
        \ of his brother and nephew violated all the principles of nature and justice;\
        \ but when there is uncontrolled power and a kingdom is the prize, these principles\
        \ have been set at nought in all ages of the world.\" Henry I. is said to\
        \ have been possessed of a handsome figure and attractive manners: he was\
        \ personally brave, and though crafty and stained with many vices he proved\
        \ a prudent monarch. Literary culture had softened the fierce Norman spirit;\
        \ but, though he caused an impartial administration of justice, he retained\
        \ the Norman prejudice against the Anglo-Saxons, and rarely entrusted any\
        \ of them with the public offices. As devoted to the chase as his two immediate\
        \ predecessors, he increas;d the forest laws in severity. Hume wrote of him\
        \ in the same way : \u2014 \" Hunting was one of his favourite amusements;\
        \ and he exercised great rigour against those who encroached on the royal\
        \ forests, which were augmented during his reign, though their number and\
        \ extent were already too great. To kill a stag was as criminal as to murder\
        \ a man: he made all the dogs be mutilated which were kept on the borders\
        \ of his forests: and he sometimes deprived his subjects of the liberty of\
        \ hunting on their own lands, or even cutting their own woods. In other respects\
        \ he executed justice, and that with rigour; the best maxim which a prince\
        \ in that age could follow. Stealing was first made capital in this reign.\
        \ False coining, which was then a very common crime, and by which the money\
        \ had been extremely debased, was severely punished by Henry. Nearly fifty\
        \ criminals of this kind were at one time hanged or mutilated; and though\
        \ these punishments seem to have been exercised in a manner some what arbitrary,\
        \ they were grateful to the people, more attentive to present advantages than\
        \ jealous of general laws.\" Henry I., Beauclerc, attained to a considerable\
        \ degree of literary culture, and liberally patronized learning. The chronicler\
        \ Ingulph, who was born in London in 1030, and was created Abbot of Croyland\
        \ by William the Conqueror, was also patronized by Henry I. Besides Anselm\
        \ and Lanfranc, men of considerable learning, there were two other distinguished\
        \ literary men. Geoffrey of Monmouth, a native and arch- and' Writers6 of\
        \ deacon of that place, wrote a work containing the legends of early Britain;\
        \ theTtmeos , ,.,. r > a b ,., Henry I. ne died m 1130. William of Malmesbury,\
        \ a native of Somersetshire, and an alumnus of Oxford, became a monk, and\
        \ librarian of Malmesbury. He wrote an Ecclesias tical History of England,\
        \ the Antiquities of Glastonbury, and on the kings of England ; he survived\
        \ Henry I. eight years. To the two following reigns belongs Henry of Huntingdon,\
        \ a distinguished historian who died in 1163.", 1]

        world, and only surpassed by the one in Paris. It contains 1,500,000 books,
        and 50,000 mss. The catalogue, as it exists in mss. volumes, is awkward, cumbersome,

        \ was of a distinctly higher literary order than theirs. The songs he wrote\
        \ for his \"fairy prince\" to sing, were graceful little lyrics, and the \"\
        \ local hits \" he introduced at the expense of colonial politicians had wit\
        \ and point ; rather too much perhaps, for one Melbourne M.P. made a vulgar\
        \ personal assault on him in Parliament, demanding his instant dismissal from\
        \ the public service. Clarke was then Sub- Librarian of the Melbourne Public\
        \ Library, a position he continued to hold till the time of his death. Garnet\
        \ Walch has perhaps greater claims as a colonial poet than his friend Marcus\
        \ Clarke, and the \" memorial verses \" written on the occasion of the latter's\
        \ death have the rare merit of genuine feeling. It would, however, be invidious\
        \ of me to attempt to criticise one with whom for years I was intimately associated.\
        \ The selections given speak for themselves. But I would like to pay a tribute\
        \ to my old comrade's kind, generous disposition. When he was engaged by an\
        \ influential Melbourne pub lishing firm (George Robertson & Co.) to bring\
        \ out an expensive book on the colony, entitled \" Victoria in 1880,\" he\
        \ was the first to ask the rival rhymesters of the place to contribute to\
        \ it, and he gave every one more prominence than himself. He has in life,\
        \ as in his writings, a perennial fund of good humour and honest hearty fun\
        \ ; his talents are great and various ; he is well educated (for which he\
        \ must thank our dear old grandmother, Germany), and in fine he is like Horatio\
        \ \u2014 \" A man that fortune's buffets and rewards Hath ta'en with equal\

        \ be loud in Garnet Walch's praises, and the book collectors will, as in the\
        \ case of Kendall, be busy buying up his scattered writings. Perhaps it would\

        \ who was authorised to call on Mr. Wilson's widow for the books and papers\
        \ held by her late husband.1 Mr. Thomson's tenure of office was comparatively\
        \ brief \u2014 only five years. He does not seem to have enjoyed the confidence\
        \ of the Council. They continued his gratuities after his half-yearly examinations,\
        \ but as much public dissatisfaction was expressed with his conduct of the\
        \ school, an intimation was made to him that his resignation would be acceptable\
        \ to the Council. At their meeting on 27th August, 1794, we find it stated,\
        \ \" Mr. Hugh Crawfurd, Kilblain, reports that he has now received from Mr.\
        \ Thomas Thomson, Grammar Schoolmaster, his resignation; and being considered\

        \ he leaves the town of Greenock with his family, and shall be no more burdensome\
        \ to the town, and to see that he acts accordingly. The meeting appoints Messrs.\
        \ Ninian Spence and Crawfurd of Kilblain, as a committee to overlook the distribution\
        \ of said money, and to act as they see prudent.\" About six months before\
        \ this, Mr. Thomson had ceased to be librarian, owing, it is alleged, to the\
        \ number of books which had been lost while the library was in his care.2\
        \ He was succeeded by Mr. Ferguson, English Master, as above stated. Dr. Nicolas\
        \ Seyer, French Alaster. At what period the study oi French first became part\
        \ of regular school instruc tion in Scotland may not be precisely determined.\
        \ It is well known that in the middle of the sixteenth century, before the\
        \ Reformation, its study was enjoined in the Grammar Schools of St. Andrews\
        \ and Aberdeen, boys being required to speak in French as well as Latin, Greek,\
        \ Hebrew, and Gaelic? The intimate relations, social, scholastic, and commercial,\
        \ then subsisting between Scotland and France, necessitated a competent acquaintance\
        \ with the French and other Continental languages. After the Reformation the\
        \ study of French declined. In the beginning of the eighteenth century it\
        \ revived. In 1574 the Town Council of Edinburgh had \" authorised a Frenchman\
        \ to open a school in the city, and desired him to put up a sign for that\
        \ end.\" Chambers, in his \" Domestic Annals of Scotland \" has over looked\
        \ this, when stating that in 1720 an advertisement appeared in the Edinburgh\
        \ Courant, apprising \" all persons desirous to learn the French tongue, that\
        \ there is a Frenchman lately come to this city who will teach at a reasonable\
        \ price,\" adding \" this would imply that there was no native teacher in\

    - ["LITERARY HISTORY. 257 In the end of the catalogue for 1792, the 'Rules of\
        \ the Greenock Library' are in serted. These are fourteen in number, and were\
        \ most probably a copy of the original laws of the institution. That they\
        \ were so is gathered pretty surely from a note explanatory of the fourth\
        \ regulation. The regulation itself is as follows \u2014 ' That the society\
        \ shall meet the second Friday of January and July, at the house of James\
        \ Stewart, vintner in Greenock, to transact the business of the society.'\
        \ The note alluded to is as follows : \u2014 \" This fourth rule is printed\
        \ as in the original regulations, but by general consent of the society, the\
        \ meetings of the proprietors of the Library are now to be held at the Grammar\
        \ School of Greenock, where the books of the Library are placed under the\
        \ care of the Librarian.\" This was a movement in the right direction. In\
        \ 1783, when the Library was formed, the number of the inhabi tants was about\
        \ 12,000. The population was rapidly increasing, and the leading inhabitants\
        \ of the town were beginning to conduct their public affairs less in the way\
        \ of social meetings than they had formerly been accustomed to do. Nine or\
        \ ten years previous to this period, the magistrates were wont to refresh\
        \ themselves with a glass of punch after the examinations of the Grammar School.\
        \ We con jecture an examination of this nature to some of them must have proved\
        \ a dry business. The committee of management made choice of at a meeting\
        \ held in the Grammar School on 14th January, 1792, were \u2014 Mr. John Dunlop,\
        \ Preses ; the Rev. Mr. Buist, Mr. Alexander Campbell, Mr. Lewis Gellie, and\
        \ Mr. William Humphry. The Librarian was Mr. Thomas Thomson, the teacher of\
        \ the Grammar School. Mr. Thomson had been the assistant of Mr. John Wilson,\
        \ and succeeded Mr. Wilson as teacher on the death of that talented gentleman,\
        \ on 22nd July, 1789.1 . . . After Mr. Ferguson took charge of the Library,\
        \ the Rev. Mr. Buist continued to bestow considerable attention to its interests,\
        \ along with the late Mr. Archibald Baine, who prepared the form of the book\
        \ for marking down the outgiving and intaking of the books ; and it is not\
        \ improbable Mr. Baine had some hand in compiling the tabular information\
        \ inserted in the catalogue of 1808. The books remained in the English School\
        \ till May, 183 1 ; thence they were removed to the Masons' Hall in Hamilton\
        \ Street, which was hired for the purpose at an annual rent of \xA335 ; and\
        \ it was not until May, 1837, that they were deposited, as their final location,\
        \ in the Watt Monument. \" The gentlemen composing the above committee were\
        \ no doubt among the first projectors of the Library \u2014 an institution\
        \ which confessedly has conferred, and is destined to continue to confer,\
        \ great benefits on the community of Greenock ; and their names, as public\
        \ benefactors, deserve to be transmitted to after-times with grateful acknowledgments.\
        \ Although the name of Mr. Patrick Campbell, a learned member of the legal\
        \ profession, who flourished at the time the Library was set on foot, is not\
        \ made mention of among the members of committee, it is understood he took\
        \ an active part in the formation of the Library, and if we recollect right\
        \ we have seen his name written \u2014 at all events we have seen it printed\
        \ \u2014 on some of the older volumes of the collection. 1 We have already\
        \ mentioned the names of Mr. Thomson and Mr. Ferguson as Librarians. Ante.,\

    - ["OLD GREENOCK. 174 tributing a few prizes among the scholars is a salutary\
        \ measure, and they leave the same and the amount to the Magistrates to determine.\"\
        \ The practice has con tinued ever since. When the Government census for 1S01\
        \ was to be taken, Mr. Ferguson's well known accuracy pointed him out as the\
        \ most eligible person to be employed to compile the requisite summaries and\
        \ tabular analyses. How satisfactorily this duty was discharged is recorded\
        \ in the following minute of Council : \u2014 \" 3rd March, 1802. \u2014 Robert\
        \ Ferguson, schoolmaster, presented an accompt for a balance of .\xA3 10 3s.\
        \ sterling for trouble in lately making out an account of the population of\
        \ Greenock. The meeting considered the same, and in respect of the great trouble\
        \ Mr. Ferguson had in making out the said account of population they allow\
        \ him the sum of \xA315 in place of the balance claimed by him, and authorize\
        \ the Treasurer to pay the said sum of \xA315 sterling.\" Happy the public\
        \ functionary whose merits are placed on a higher level than his own humble\
        \ estimate ! Mr. Ferguson succeeded Mr. Thomson as librarian at the salary\
        \ paid him, and half of the fines, his hours to be from 1 till 2 every lawful\
        \ day. Immediately after this, Mr. Ferguson's school having removed to over\
        \ the Butter Market, the Library was removed thither also. In 1797 the Library\
        \ Committee dispensed with his at tendance on Saturdays. He resigned in January,\
        \ 1807, about a year before his death. In 1798 he had also been appointed\
        \ Treasurer to the Library, at a salary of \xA310 ios. for both offices. In\
        \ 1805 it was raised to \xA312 12s.1 On 24th August, 1786, about six months\
        \ after his election as English Master, he was appointed Session Clerk and\
        \ Precentor of the Old Parish.2 In 1793 he was chosen Kirk Treasurer. When\
        \ his predecessor's accounts were made up it was found that he had a balance\
        \ of \xA354 odds in his hands, for which the Session took his and his cautioner's\
        \ bill at one day's date, \" after deducting for his five years' salary.\"\
        \ On Mr. Ferguson's death, his son Robert, afterwards well known as one of\
        \ the clerks in the Long Room in the Custom House, was allowed to continue\
        \ to trans act the business of the poor, as he had done for some time. Eventually\
        \ Mr. John Munro was appointed Session Clerk, Precentor, and Kirk Treasurer,\
        \ by a large majority over the Rev. John Dunn, the other candidate, and this\
        \ brings us within touch of the men of the present generations 1 Mr. Paton's\
        \ \" Notes regarding the Greenock Library ;\" also the Supplement to the Catalogue\
        \ of 1850. 2 He succeeded James Simpson, who had held the temporary appointment\
        \ after the resignation of John M'Ewan, schoolmaster, who had resigned about\
        \ the year 1784, having been Session Clerk and schoolmaster for upwards of\
        \ 20 years. He appears to have resigned in consequence of a dispute between\
        \ him and Mr. Turner, the minister, and Mr. Love, his assistant, into the\
        \ particulars of which we do not enter. It was the subject of an appeal to\
        \ the Presbytery, in which M'Ewan was supported by Sir John Shaw Stewart,\
        \ Mr. Crawfurd of Cartsburn, and all the elders. The difference was amicably\
        \ adjusted, but Mr. M'Ewan soon afterwards resigned or was superseded, when\
        \ Mr. Simpson received the interim appointment. Mr. Simpson having complained\
        \ of his inadequate remuneration, the Session voted him \xA32 2s., \"the one\
        \ to be paid out of the funds, the other by Mr. Ferguson, his successor.\"\

        \ \u2014 at which his companions were inclined to laugh \u2014 Gait says that\
        \ he had acquired a knowledge of mathematics far beyond his companions' conception,\
        \ and was acquainted with the philosophy of various subjects to which none\
        \ of them had paid the slightest attention. He re mained with Struthers till\
        \ his death in 1797, and returned to reside with his mother in Greenock, his\
        \ father having meantime died.2 After his return to Greenock, he rejoined\
        \ the literary society of which he had been a member. This must have been\
        \ the period when some, at least, of the brochures referred to were composed.\
        \ This continued till the spring of 1804. In 1805, in company with Park, he\
        \ visited most parts of England, spending some time with Gait, who had then\
        \ removed to London. In 1808 he was again in London, and during his residencejthere\
        \ of several months, he published his essay on \"Logarithmic Transcendents.\"\
        3 In 1814 he married an English lady to whom he had been long attached. After\
        \ some time he returned with Mrs. Spence to Scotland, was taken ill at Glasgow,\
        \ and died in the hotel in which they had put up for the night, on the 20th\
        \ of May, 181 5. Gait speaks of his accomplishments in Latin, French, and\
        \ Italian, his reading in these languages being restricted to mathematical\
        \ and scientific works. \"In music he was not only a scientific harmonist\
        \ and a pleasing composer, but he performed on the flute with admirable sweetness\
        \ and skill. He wrote respectable verses, and had a fine tenor voice, which\
        \ enabled him to sing pathetic airs, especially of his own composition, with\
        \ much taste and effect.\" In 1819 his mathematical essays were edited with\
        \ a preface by John F. W. Herschel, Esq. (afterwards Sir John Herschel,) and\
        \ it was to these essays Gait's biographical sketch was prefixed. It may interest\
        \ our readers to know the opinion entertained of Mr. Spence's merits by his\
        \ fellow townsmen. We, therefore, quote the following obituary notice of him,\
        \ which ap peared in the Greenock Advertiser immediately after his death \"\
        \ in the 37th year of his age, a loss which the scientific world has reason\
        \ to lament, and which will long be felt by a circle of friends in England\
        \ as well as in Scotland, who knew and ad mired his genius, and to whom he\

        \ likeness of Mr. Spence is preserved in the Greenock Library, presented by\
        \ David Agnew, Esq, and, in the absence of photography, may afford some idea\
        \ of his personal appearance. Mr. Agnew also presented a similar one of Mr.\
        \ Gait, said to have been painted by a French artist. 2 Spence lived in his\
        \ father's house in Hamilton Street, situated at the head of a long court.\
        \ The house had a window in the gable looking down the court. It was many\
        \ years ago taken down, and the building numbered 26 occupies its site. The\
        \ table seat in the New Parish Church occupied by Spence, his wife and sister,\
        \ could, before the recent removal ofthe seats, be still pointed out. It was\
        \ occupied also by the families of the late Provost Watt and Collector Johnston.\
        \ 3 It is interesting to record that Spence had not forgot his early indebtedness\
        \ to the Greenock Library, to which at this period he and his brother John\
        \ became subscribers, and with very allowable pride he presented to the Library\
        \ a copy of his essay on \" Logarithmic Transcendents,\" with an autograph\

        \ I. \u2014 The Public Library. tSfjjffllN tracing the rise and progress of\
        \ local literature a prominent place must be m m assigned to the Greenock\
        \ Library as one of the most important factors in forming and improving the\
        \ public taste, and fostering that love of literary fame to which not a few\
        \ of our citizens have attained. \" The Greenock Library\" was begun in 1783,\
        \ and started with eighty-two pay ing subscribers, and a revenue of ,\xA3\
        63 3s. It fluctuated both in the number of sub scribers and amount of revenue\
        \ between 1784 and 1801, when in the latter year an increase in the number\
        \ of the subscribers took place, but an increase by no means commensurate\
        \ with the importance of the undertaking, or calculated to keep the institution\
        \ in a healthful and vigorous condition. Viewed as an auxiliary educa tional\
        \ establishment, the Library merits, and ought to obtain, the most cordial\
        \ and liberal support ofthe community. In 1787, a catalogue ofthe books was\
        \ prepared by the Librarian of that period, and printed and circulated among\
        \ the subscribers. According to that catalogue, which enumerates the contents\
        \ ofthe library by volumes, the numbers were : \u2014 32 folio, 52 quarto,\
        \ 327 octavo et infra ; in all 411 volumes. In 1792, another catalogue was\
        \ made out, printed, and circulated.2 In this second issue the contents of\
        \ the Library are enumerated by books, the size classification of the former\
        \ being retained, and the numbers given as follows : \u2014 17 books in folio,\
        \ 37 books in quarto, 181 books in octavo et infra. From this catalogue we\
        \ learn that appendices were made out for 1793 and 1794, and from a bye-law\
        \ inserted in a foot note of the second page of this little work, annual appendices\
        \ were directed to be printed on paper of the same size as the catalogue till\
        \ a new one should be made. With a frugal foresight the same bye-law intimated\
        \ to subscribers that if they should lose their catalogues or appendices they\
        \ must pay for new copies. Even at that early stage of the Library it would\
        \ appear that some of the volumes were amissing \u2014 a casualty to which,\
        \ we fear, the present enlarged stock may sometimes be subjected. The appendices\
        \ of 1793 and 1794 having been printed on fly sheets, none of them are now\
        \ extant ; and if a succession of appendices were published down to 1808,\
        \ when a comprehensive catalogue was compiled, they have suffered the fate\
        \ of the others. 1 Extracted from \" Historical Notices of the Greenock Library\
        \ \" by the author's father, appended to supplement of the catalogue published\
        \ in 1850. 2 The only copies of the first two catalogues known to exist are\
        \ in the possession of the author. Reprints -of them were issued to the proprietors\
        \ of the Library at the centenary of the Institution in January, 1883.", 1]

        \ money in the hands of the Treasurer ; but at some suture period the consideration\
        \ of this application will be resumed.\" That period never arrived. Thomas\
        \ Thomson, Grammar Schoolmaster. We have stated that Mr. Wilson resigned the\
        \ active duties of his mastership about two years before his death in 1789.\
        \ At that date, the school had been con ducted by Mr. Thomas Thomson, an assistant\
        \ engaged and paid by Mr. Wilson, who up till his death drew his salaries\
        \ of Grammar Schoolmaster and Session Clerk. What Mr. Thomson's previous history\
        \ was we have no means of knowing. Most probably he was some relative of that\
        \ Mr. Thomson who had been Mr. Wilson's teacher at Lanark. At all events,\
        \ he was a stranger in town, as appears by the following extract minute of\
        \ Town Council of 7th March, 1788. \"The meeting taking into their consideration\
        \ that Thomas Thomson, Teacher of the Grammar School, came at ane unfavourable\
        \ time of the year to this place, as Mr. Wilson the master of the school has\
        \ the whole sallary and Mr. Thomson no part of it, the meeting agreed to give\
        \ him a present of 7 guineas as an encouragement to him to pay attention to\
        \ his school.\" 5th August, 1788, \" same day there was a letter given in\
        \ to the meeting by Mr. Thomas Thomson, setting furth that he was very sensible\
        \ of the getiteel present conferred upon him, yet from the cautious prudence\
        \ of the inhabitants hesitating to entrust their children to his care, being\
        \ a stranger, he found himself in such an awkward situation that he was under\
        \ the disagreeable necessity of encroaching upon their patience once more\
        \ ; however he was in hopes that the first year would be the hardest ; let\
        \ the present favour be deducted from the future. The Treasurer was authorised\
        \ to give him 7 guineas and to take credit for the same in his accounts with\
        \ the Town.\" All this occurred during his assistantship. On 22nd July, 1789,\
        \ a letter from Mr. Thomson was read \" craving that he might be appointed\
        \ successor to Mr. Wilson, and alongst with the said letter there was given\
        \ in a certificate under the hands of the ministers,1 and some of the principal\
        \ inhabitants of the town, bearing that they had attended the examination\
        \ of the scholars taught by the said Mr. Thomson, and approved of his manner\
        \ of teaching of the Latin tongue, and the progress made by the scholars under\
        \ him.\" These having been considered, the Council unanimously elected him\
        \ master of the school, upon the usual terms, his teaching being confined\
        \ to Latin and Greek. About the same period Mr. Thomson was appointed Mr.\
        \ Wilson's successor as librarian.2 Mr. Wilson, as above stated, held the\
        \ office of Session Clerk of the New Parish in con junction with the Grammar\
        \ School Mastership. Mr. Thomson applied for the office, but the Kirk-Session\
        \ appointed the Rev. Mr. Kennedy, the assistant minister. This 1 The ministers\
        \ were \u2014 Mr. John Adam, of the New Parish, who had succeeded Mr. Shaw\
        \ in 1770 ; Mr. Robert Steele, Old Parish, 1792 ; Mr. Kenneth Bayne, Gaelic\
        \ Chapel of Ease, 1792 ; and Mr. Archibald MacLachlan, East Chapel of Ease,\

    - ["EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 181 The following Teachers of French, Spanish, and Italian,\
        \ etc., were not sub sidised by the Town : \u2014 Mons. Lemonier, Teacher\
        \ of French. [After Mr. Capron's death, a Monsieur Lemonier,1 styling himself\
        \ as his suc cessor, advertised, (13th November, 1805,) that \"he has now\
        \ taken up several of his classes, and that any gentlemen who were with him,\
        \ and who would please to attend him, may apply to Mr. Lemonier, at his lodgings,\
        \ (Mr. Maclachlan's,) near the Gaelic Chapel.\" In 1809 he removed to the\
        \ head of Charles Street, the house, we believe, erected by Mr. John Campbell\
        \ Goldsmith, afterwards the property of Sir Gabriel Wood's father. Before\
        \ this change another French teacher announced him self. This was the Rev.\
        \ John Dunn, who had from 1798 till 1807 been minister of the Anti-Burgher\
        \ Church in \" Wee Kirk Street,\" and had been appointed Librarian in succession\
        \ to Mr. Ferguson. Mr. Dunn's classes met in the Library, and em braced, among\
        \ other subjects, Latin, French, and German, the latter class being taught\
        \ from 12 till 1 ; but the hour was changed, as it did not suit the subscribers\
        \ to the Library, then open from 12 till 2. The classes were designed for\
        \ young men in business, and for young ladies as well. Mr. Dunn's proceedings\
        \ displeased Le monier, who thus made known his intentions : \u2014 \" Mr.\
        \ Lemonier need not say that he is a native of France, where he had a most\
        \ liberal education ; that since his leaving the College he never ceased to\
        \ improve himself more and more, and of course should have the preference\
        \ over teachers who, never having left this country, where they had but little\
        \ intercourse with persons versed in the French language, can hardly be so\
        \ much as supposed to pronounce it properly, read it well, write it correctly,\
        \ speak it with ease, if they speak it at all, and who for not being masters\
        \ of its harmonious sounds, idioms, and niceties, can have and give but a\
        \ very slight smattering of French indeed.\" Mr. Lemonier died at Greenock,\
        \ and was buried in the Old West Church Yard. Rev. John Davidson, Teacher\
        \ of Spanish. After Mr. Dunn and Mr. Lemonier had opened their classes, the\
        \ Rev. John Davidson, the first minister of the Roman Catholic Church in Greenock,\
        \ advertised a class in 1809 for instruction in Spanish, in which Mr. Dunn\
        \ had anticipated him. He stated that \"having from a residence of nearly\
        \ twelve years in that country [Spain,] acquired a tolerable knowledge of\
        \ the Spanish language, he wishes to em ploy a part of his leisure time in\
        \ instructing young gentlemen in the principles of that language. Mr. D. proposes\
        \ to open for that purpose an additional class on the 1 2th of June, betwixt\
        \ the hours of 6 and 7 afternoon.\" Apparently to prove that there was no\
        \ rivalry between him and Mr. Dunn, he added, \" Those who may be inclined\
        \ to join the class will be informed of the terms by applying to Mr. Da vidson\
        \ at his house, third floor, Macaulay's Land, Market Street, or to the Rev.\
        \ 1 Lemonier is said to have been a clergyman, although he does not so design\
        \ himself.", 1]

    - ["LITERARY HISTORY. 265 Section V. \u2014 Local Publications. The earliest local\
        \ publication with which we are acquainted is a small book printed in 1780,\
        \ by William M'Alpine, bookseller, and bears a curious title \u2014 \" Genuine\
        \ Narratives and concise Memoirs of some of the most interesting exploits\
        \ and singular adventures of J. M'Alpine, a native Highlander, from the time\
        \ of his emigration from Scotland to America, 1773.\" The author, John M'Alpine,\
        \ details his \" faithful attachment to, and hazardous attendance on, the\
        \ British armies, under the command of the Generals Carleton and Burgoyne,\
        \ in their several operations till December 1779.\" He complains of the unmerited\
        \ neglect of his long-continued services, and narrates the petitions he had\
        \ in vain addressed to the British Government for reparation of his losses\
        \ in the Royal cause, which he calculated at no less than \xA35,009 2s. 46,}\
        \ Six years later another work was published, not in Greenock, but in London,\
        \ the author being Godfrey M'Calman, Surgeon in Greenock, titled, \" A Critical\
        \ Inquiry into the Motion of the Sun, and Stability of the Earth,\" a pamphlet\
        \ of upwards of 200 pages, in which his views are discussed under 12 sections.\
        \ His opinion is clearly enough stated in the Latin quotation on the title\
        \ page \u2014 \" Medio tutissima pendet terra,\" and his concluding sentence\
        \ is in the following words: \u2014 \" the centre of the worldly system, says\
        \ Sir Isaac Newton, being immoveable, is a circumstance acknowledged by all,\
        \ while some contend that it is the earth, others the sun that is fixed there.\
        \ Thus far, and no farther, he who stands first in the first rank of astronomers\
        \ proceeded in the solution of the present inquiry.\" In 1803 and subse quent\
        \ years, the Rev. N. Douglas, Minister of the Gospel in Greenock, issued several\
        \ pamphlets or tracts, copies of which are in Mr. Paton's collection. The\
        \ first we shall notice is titled, \" Probable consequences of a successful\
        \ invasion, and the most effectual means of defeating it.\" It was printed\
        \ by William Johnston for the author, and sold by him and W. Watson and J.\
        \ Stewart, booksellers, 1803. The pamphlet is of the nature of a sermon, and\
        \ is occupied throughout with warnings addressed to the nation in the apprehended\
        \ invasion of Napoleon, against leaning upon an arm of flesh. At the same\
        \ time he inveighs against the national sin of slavery, and advocates economy,\
        \ particularly in the article of gunpowder, which, he alleges, would go far\
        \ to alleviate the burden of the national debt. He condemns the prac tice\
        \ of discharging artillery on certain days, in saluting admirals and great\
        \ men, which he thought might produce, in the course of a year, the amount\
        \ of \xA33,000,000 at least, of the public revenue. Mr. Paton has placed beside\
        \ the book a copy of a 1 Weir in his \" History of Greenock,\" p. 97, asserts\
        \ that it was not till 1765 that any printer domiciled among us. This was\
        \ William M'Alpine, who was also the first bookseller. A reprint of M'Alpine's\
        \ book was issued by Mr. Innes, bookseller, a few years ago, from the original,\
        \ in the possession of Mr. Paton, Librarian, who has preserved it among numerous\
        \ other interesting literary curiosities, which he has accumulated. The result\
        \ of Mr. Paton's researches, as noted by him, is that John M'Alpine was a\
        \ native of Rannoch, Perthshire, that his real name was M'Gregor, but he had\

        of baptism, the marriages of his flock, and officiating at their funerals.
        In May, 1825, Mr. Steele''s congregation and admiring friends presented him
        with his portrait in oil, by Mr. John Fleming, artist, Collector Bissland,
        of H.M- Customs, in the chair. It is painted with Mr. Fleming''s usual skill,
        and represents the "Bishop" in gown and bands, seated at a table bearing an
        open Bible, and placed near a window, through which is seen the church, and
        a glimpse of the river is caught, with a ship in full sail on it. It is now
        deposited in the Greenock Library for preservation, by Mr. Steele''s family,
        under certain conditions agreed to by the Committee of Management. Mr. Steele
        had at least three assistants, whose names we recall. There may have been
        others, but the following were familiar to us. First, Mr. William Mather,
        licensed by the Presbytery of Paisley in 1827, and who afterwards (1832) became
        minister of the quoad sacra church of Stanley, in the Presbytery of Perth,
        and joined the Free Church of Scotland. It is not very long since Mr. Mather
        died. Next came Mr. (afterwards Dr.) John Park. Mr. Park was licensed in 1829.
        After leaving Greenock he became assistant to the Rev. Mr. Gregor of Bonhill.
        In 1831 he was ordained pastor of Rodney Street Scotch Church, Liverpool,
        Mr. (afterwards Dr.) Candlish having succeeded him as Mr. Gregor''s assistant.
        In 1843 ne was presented by the Duke of Buccleuch to the Parish of Glencairn,
        where he remained eleven years, and was finally translated to the first charge
        of the Collegiate Parish Church of St. Andrews, where he died in 1865. Dr.
        Park was one ofthe early and intimate associates of the Rev. A. J. Scott,
        of Owens'' College, Manchester. He had a cultivated taste, was a contributor
        to the Visitor, a Greenock literary miscellany, and excelled as poet and musician
        as well as divine. His sudden death at St. Andrews is well known. A collection
        of his songs, set to music, has lately been published. He was greatly esteemed
        by those who were admitted to the inner circle of his friends. His memory
        is still cherished in the town of his birth. His nephew, Mr. Allan Park Paton,
        is librarian of the Greenock Library. Mr. Park was succeeded as assistant
        in the West Church by Mr. (afterwards Dr.) James Gibson of Kingston or Maxwelton
        Extension Church, Glasgow, who joined the Free Church, and was at his death
        one of the Theological Professors of Glasgow Free College. The third assistant
        was Mr. John Macintyre, a young man of pro mise, elder son of Mr. Patrick
        Macintyre, Locker in the service of the Customs, an old and respected member
        of the Kirk-Session. This young preacher was very much liked by the congregation.
        Being in delicate health, he had gone to visit a friend in Glasgow, and died
        somewhat suddenly only three days before Mr. Steele, so that when the venerable
        pastor died, the church was doubly vacant. Mr. Steele''s death occurred on
        6th December, 1831, in the 78th year of his age and the 40th of his ministry.
        For several months before his decease, he was practically laid aside from
        duty, having been stricken by paralysis a few days before the Spring Sacrament
        of 183 1. During the summer he rallied considerably, but in the beginning
        of December, he was seized with a bronchial affection, to which his N', 1]

        \ Axon is to be numbered, but, unlike very many of them, he has not turned\
        \ his back upon his native city for either broader or fairer fields. Such\
        \ as Manchester was and is, he has clung to her with an affec tion intensified\
        \ by the moral aspects which the struggle of humanity presents in such a place.\
        \ He was born in 1846, and is \" self educated in the best sense.\" At fifteen\
        \ he became assistant librarian at the Manchester Free Library, under the\
        \ late Dr. Crestadoro, a position he held until he was twenty-eight, when\
        \ he made a brief trial of a commercial life, and found it little to his taste.\
        \ Since that short incursion into uncon genial fields, he has devoted himself\

        \ which are not to be measured even by the mass of his published work, great\
        \ as that is. Mr. George Milner, on a recent occasion, thus referred to that\

        \ and at the same time he is ready to soar on the wing of the lightest fancy.\
        \ . . In short, he is steeped to the lips in literature, and a sworn knight\

        \ Field Naturalists' Society, Cryptogamic Society, and many others, as well\
        \ as to numerous weekly, monthly, and annual publications. He is also an active,\
        \ honorary, or corresponding member of several learned societies, both home\
        \ and foreign. A complete bibliography of his published work would occupy\
        \ several of these pages ; and still, it must he remembered, Mr. Axon is a\

        is considered the perfecter of the steam engine. Here is also a memorial of
        Charles Morrison, who knew something of electric telegraphy in 1753. The genuine
        autographs of Byron, Burns, Scott, Dickens, Jennie Lind, and many famous writers
        of England, Ireland and Scotland were seen at this lib rary and they form

        in which capacity as well as in private life he was universally and deservedly
        esteemed. His natural history of birds will remain a monument of his knowledge.
        1 James Anderson, a native of Hermiston, near Edinburgh, a well known writer
        of agricultural, commercial and political essays. The University of Aberdeen
        conferred upon him the title of LL.D. In 1784 he was employed by the Government
        in investi gating the North British fisheries, a subject on which he had previously
        written. In 1791 he commenced the publication of "The Bee," a weekly magazine,
        which had great success. About the year 1797 he removed to the neighbourhood
        of London and some time afterwards took a house near the church of West Ham,
        where he began publishing his "Recreations in Agriculture." During the latter
        part of his life he devoted himself almost entirely to the relaxation of a
        quiet life and particularly the cultivation of his garden, which was now become
        the miniature o! his past labours, and here he died in 1808. His writings
        are very numerous; besides the agricultural articles contributed to the "Monthly
        Review" and some articles in the first edition of the " Eucyclopaedia Britannica,"
        he published a " Practical Treatise on Chemistry," " Observations on Slavery,"
        " Letters to General Washington," on an " Universal Character," etc. 2 Mr.
        Edwards was born at Stratford in this parish in the year 1693. His " History
        of Birds " raised his name as the greatest ornithologist, who had ever appeared.
        After a long series of years, the most stupendous application and the most
        extensive correspondence, he completed in 1764 his " Gleanings of Natural
        History," a work, which contains engravings and descriptions of more than
        600 subjects in natural history not before described or delineated. He also
        added a general index in French and English, which was afterwards completed
        with the Linnaean names by that great naturalist Linnaeus himself, who honoured
        him with his friendship and correspondence. In the year 1769 he retired to
        a small house at Plaistow, where he died. His latter years were much embittered
        by a cancerous complaint, which deprived him of the sight of one of his eyes,
        but it was nevertheless remarked, that in the severest paroxysms of misery,
        he was scarcely known to utter a single complaint. Having completed his 80th
        year and become emaciated with age and sickness he died 1773 and was interred
        in the church yard of West Ham, his native parish, where his executors erected
        a stone with the above inscription to perpetuate his talents as artist and

        finds a path for itself and at the same time and at once outstrips itself.
        This realism was after all but a halt, it immediately became art again. The
        conception of the new " light picture " lasted but a moment. In vain do we
        blame the canon for not looking like a genius, like a poet, for being piti
        fully like a bookworm, like a librarian. It is not the man''s fault. He is
        neither older nor stouter than Nature made him. The reverent way in which
        he kneels beside the Holy Virgin and the child Jesus is part of himself. You
        would not wish it to be otherwise. Your protest is an involuntary eulogy.
        You are perfectly satisfied. The canon remained a bookworm and an elderly
        bachelor ; his counterfeit became a poem. " The Adoration of the Lamb " has
        this great interest also, that the whole of its panels complemented by those
        that are at Berlin and Brussels form a great work representing the whole of
        the art of the Van Eycks with regard to colour as well as with regard to landscape
        and portrait. The latter branch of art is represented by the pictures of the

        the student of diplomatic history. The Cincinnati Pub lic Library readily
        sent books on my application, and my thanks for the favor are due to the librarian.
        At the As tor Library in New York I was enabled to consult the Hardwicke Papers,
        recently purchased in England by a wise outlay of considerable money. If I
        found little new material in a collection which had already been used by archdeacon
        Coxe and others, I was at least enabled to verify the statements made by them,
        to convince my self that the resources of these MSS. have been by no means
        exhausted, and that the example set in their pur chase might well be followed
        by other American libraries. The kind permission of Mr. Francis Parkman gave
        me an opportunity to examine the voluminous material col lected by him in
        the archives of Paris and London, and now deposited with the Massachusetts
        Historical Society. The fruitful use which the owner himself has made of this
        material renders it forever unlikely that another writer will undertake to
        cultivate the same field ; but the papers, which with rare unselfishness he
        has thus thrown open to the public, will always help special students to find
        light upon many obscure points in the colonial history of North America, and
        its relations to the general history of Europe. To all the gentlemen who have
        thus aided me in their public or private capacity, and to many others, who,
        in one way or another, have rendered willing and useful service, my grateful
        acknowledgments are made. In the spelling of proper names I have tried to
        avoid the appearance of pedantry which would follow a rigid ad herence to
        any one system, and the anarchy which would result from the neglect of all
        systems. Where there are established English forms for geographical terms
        I have usually employed them; in other cases I have used some-', 1]

        are places of worship for Baptists, Independents, Wesleyans, Roman Catholics,
        and Unitarians, several schools, and a literary institute. The police station
        is in Albion Row, where there is an excellent library for the use of the force,
        established by, and under the supervision of, the chief clerk, who is the
        librarian. A fair for cattle is held on the last day of April. Some of the
        houses are built on the edge of a pleasing eminence, which encircles some
        fine meadows. The Abbey fields are watered by a small winding trout stream;
        there was a lake but it is now dried up. On the descent into the vale is seen
        the ruined gothic gateway of the ancient priory, and a little beyond, the
        ruins of the venerable castle, the lodge gate of which, is still in good preservation
        ; the site is on a rising ground, surrounded by a deep moat, the walls are
        still discoverable all around, and the area which they encompass is seven
        acres ; five of the towers are still visible, and one of them is entire ;
        there are many beautiful traces of ancient architecture visible, par ticularly
        a spacious banqueting room, the windows of which are very large and beautifully
        ornamented. Henry I. bestowed the manor upon Geoffrey de Clinton who erected
        a strong fortress, which he completed in 1120. In the time of Henry II. it
        reverted to the Crown and remained in it''s possession during the reign of

    - ['86 tbe upper atoreya, which more or leas impeded heavy traffic and wagons
        going through the road loaded with straw and hay had been known to pull out
        the wooden framework of the projecting windows. Several houBes had been refronted
        before the pulling down, aud set lineable with the frontage ; but it was not
        so with the majority of them. The shops, at the time, had low ceilings, and
        the windows consisted of small panes of glass, with a considerable amount
        of heavy framing and sash-bars, which, with the overhanging fronts, rendered
        the shops very dark. Such was the state of things when Broadgate was widened
        from eighteen or twenty feet to eighty feet. From a plan prepared at that
        time, we obtain a glance at the occupiers of the various premises in Broadgate,
        aud add others to complete the list, from the remembrances of some of the
        city''s oldeBt inhabitants. In tbe block facing Cross-cheap ing, the house
        in the corner of the square, adjoining the Castle Hotel (now the Conservative
        Club), and at right angles thereto, was then occupied by a fiBh manger named
        Devile. The next, facing the cross, was used for the Old Library, of which
        Mr. Spell, of the firm of Spell and Slingsby, was original pro moter, and
        Samuel Armstrong librarian. The latter was a first-class amateur draughts
        man, and a sketch of his shows Old Broadgate as it then existed. Next the
        library was John Johnson, the saddler, followed by Soare, the painter, whilst
        at the corner of Cross cheaping and Broadgate was Butterworth''s ; Conroy
        had a cellar under Butterworth''s shop. Then oame Barton, the boot and shoe
        maker, adjoining whom was Thomas Smith, the grocer. His sbop was set back.
        The firm was afterwards Thomas Smith and Son, who, in about 1827, sold teas,
        blacks from 3s. 4d. to 6s. per pound, and green from 4s. 8d. to 10s. ; coffee,
        from la. to 2s. 4d. ; raw sugars, from 4^d. to 8d. ; fine lump, 9d. and 10d.,
        and Fry''s cocoa, 2s. per pound. Smith was then trying to "cut" the trade,
        but until Dakin and Byewater opened, the prices of tea were retained, and
        it waa generally sixpence per ounce. Groceries suitable for a small family
        which would be purchased in those days for sixteen shillings, can now be pro
        cured for five-and-sixpence. Adjoining Mr. Smith''s was a house ocoupied by
        Mr. Ramm as a circulating library ; then W. Parker, the oil and colour merchant,
        who was succeeded in business by Mr. J. Astley in 1820. Adjoining was the
        shop of Mr. John Ward, the grocer ; next Bant, the fishmonger, occupied the
        frontage, behind which wat the Three Tuna Inn, a very old hostel, having',

        \ aud enterprise, and it is well-nigh impossible to doubt his future advancement\
        \ and prosperity. Wordley & Co., Jewellers, &c, 56, Lord Street. \u2014 Among\
        \ the many firms of goldsmiths, silversmiths, and jewellers in Liverpool there\
        \ is not one that can show a more interesting or favourable record of their\
        \ operations than that which is now carried on under the style of Wordley\
        \ & Co., whose attractive premises are most conveniently located. Tbe history\
        \ of this house is an interesting one, and well worthy of notice in this review.\
        \ Established so far back as 1796 by Mr. Richard Harper, it is unnecessary\
        \ to point out that it has passed through a series of years that witnessed\
        \ many changes in the history of British commercial in terests. In 1817 the\
        \ concern passed into the hands of Messrs. James Wordley and J. Dentith, under\
        \ whose joint management it continued down to 1822. In the meantime, however,\
        \ between 1817 and 1823, the Corporation found it necessary to improve Lord\
        \ Street, and the business of the house had to be transferred to Bold Street,\
        \ where it was pursued until the 29th September, 1828, when the original premises\
        \ were once more made the scene of their operations, and Mr. Dentith retired.\
        \ In 1838 the concern assumed the style of Wordley and Mayer, and in 1842\
        \ Mr. James Wordley again succeeded to the business as its sole proprietor.\
        \ In 1858 the present firm of Wordley & Co. was established. In 1860, on the\
        \ death of Mr. Wordley, Mr. Williams, in conjunction with another gentleman,\
        \ succeeded to the business. It is needless to say that the invaluable services\
        \ of Mr. James Wordley can be no longer of any advantage to this reputable\
        \ concern, but his name will lend distinction to its operations for many years\
        \ yet to come. Mr. W. C. Williams is now solely responsible for the working\
        \ of the establishment, and it is but fair to say in justice to that gentleman\
        \ that he richly deserves such a valuable succession. This concern now commands\
        \ the support and patronage of the most influential portion of the population\
        \ of the city, and it is a pleasure to draw attention to the fact that it\
        \ is to-day patro nised by royalty and the nobility. It may be remembered\
        \ that a few years ago this firm was entrusted with the manufacture of the\
        \ spade used by the Duchess of Albany in planting a tree at Preston. It would\
        \ be impossible to refer with any pretensions to accuracy to the various de\
        \ partments in the operations of this concern. Arms and crests are engraved\
        \ on seals, electro plate, and any article of jewellery ; arms are emblazoned\
        \ on vellum, plate manufactured for presentation, diamonds worked, and watches\
        \ made to order, and a hundred and one other items too long and tedious to\
        \ mention. The premises are conveniently located, and consist of an entire\
        \ building of modern construction, excellently fitted and most elaborately\
        \ arranged, giving every facility to the progress of the concern. A bird's\
        \ eye view of the business would reveal a scene of the greatest activity.\
        \ Capable assistants attending to the wants of the distinguished customers,\
        \ and first class workmen plying their trades in the workshop. Mr. W. C. Williams\
        \ is a most practical tradesman himself, and his other qualifications highly\
        \ adapt him for the general working of the concern. He is active, energetic,\
        \ full of vigour, and conducts the business on the most honourable and systematic\
        \ lines. He fully recog- nises the importance of his position, and the reputation\
        \ of the concern that has been handed down to him to maintain. He is highly\
        \ respected in the city among commercial men, and it is pleasing to see the\
        \ prosperity that is associated with the name of Wordley & Co. under his skilful,\
        \ judicious, and earnest management. T. Hinde & Son, Boot Manufacturers, 10,\
        \ Richmond Street. \u2014 There are very few among the bootmakers of Liverpool\
        \ who devote themselves to any particular line in the trade, or make anything\
        \ a speciality ; one notable exception, however, is the firm of Hinde & Son,\
        \ established in 1857. The speciality of the concern is the \"Hind\" boot\
        \ (registered), which for durability, resistance to damp, retention of shape\
        \ and comfort in wear, is unsurpassed by anything in the boot line in the\

        \ of sole required, for walking, touring, shooting, or fishing purposes, for\
        \ which the boot may be designed. The \" Hind \" boot is also made for boys\
        \ in the natural shape, which does not in any way impede the growth or development\
        \ of the foot, and is rapidly becoming a general favourite, a good trade being\
        \ done, which is daily on the increase. This firm also manufactures theFlexura\
        \ boot, which, by the insertion ofa steel spring in the waist, is made remarkably\
        \ pliable, and gives an arched and symmetrical appearance to the foot. Hinde\
        \ & Son also make their \" Impermeable \" waterproof boots from alligator\
        \ skin and their famous grain porpoise hide, which they were the first to\
        \ introduce into Liverpool. They give special attention to the making of lasts\
        \ to suit the peculiarities of the feet, and boot-trees to preserve the shape\
        \ of boots. Although their premises are not situated in a main thoroughfare,\
        \ Hinde & Son have, during the thirty years they have been in business, succeeded,\
        \ by judicious management and employment of the most highly skilled workmen,\
        \ in securing a high and widespread reputation, their name, in fact, having\
        \ become not only in Liverpool, but throughout the country, a guarantee for\
        \ superiority of production. Henry Scott, \" Feathers \" Hotel, Clayton Square.\
        \ \u2014 This old and highly respectable hotel has been established nearly\
        \ 70 years, namely, since 1820. For a very long period prior to its coming\
        \ into the possession of the present proprietor (Mr. Scott), it was earned\
        \ on by Mrs. Ann Pilkington, who was a lady of great business talent, and\
        \ moreover, a lady universally respected by her clients and acquaintances.\
        \ The \" Feathers \" Hotel was always a great commercial house. The hotel\
        \ has become very much modernized since Mr. Scott has come upon the scene.\
        \ He venerates the past, but he believes in the present, and being a gentleman\
        \ of energy and enterprise, he has thought fit to make great alterations,\
        \ with the object of making the establishment more attractive. The bar has\
        \ been completely metamorphosed, and is now one of the best patronized in\
        \ Liverpool. But this need not be wondered at, for the \" boss,\" as the proprietor\
        \ styles himself, is genial and affable. The \" boss \" is a philosopher as\
        \ well as a wit. A restaurant has also been added to the hotel, and there\
        \ are also dining, tea, and supper rooms comfortably fitted. We have only\
        \ to add that the \" Feathers \" is an admirably conducted hotel, the accommodation\
        \ is superior, the attendance good, the catering first class, the tariff very\
        \ moderate, and the beers, wines, and liquors of all sorts of the choicest\
        \ quality. It is situated in the very heart of the city, and within two or\
        \ three minutes walk of the principal railway stations and theatres, and of\
        \ Bold Street, Church Street, and Lord Street. Mr. Scott is a capital host,\
        \ and he is deservedly popular and respected in the city. The Liverpool Select\
        \ Library, 10, Colquitt Street. \u2014 Among the many useful institutions\
        \ which abound in Liverpool, few surpass in general utility and perfection\
        \ in detail the Liverpool Select Library. This excellent and widely patronised\
        \ concern has its head quarters in a convenient location, where extensive\
        \ premises have been secured. The library, which is one of the best in the\
        \ city owned by a private body, was established in 1859. Ever since, without\
        \ inter mission, the concern has continued to grow in popular estimation,\
        \ and to receive more than an average share of public support. The methodical\
        \ manner in which the place is managed, and the great judg ment shown in the\
        \ purchase of select and useful works, are the prime causes of the high estimation\
        \ in which the library is held, and the ex tended patronage accorded to it\
        \ by the most cultured people in the city and suburbs. Mr. A. Fergusson is\
        \ the librarian, and no better guarantee than his presence is required for\
        \ the orderly and careful arrangement of the valuable books which the library\
        \ contains in large numbers. George Hague, Outfitter, 65, Byrom Street.\u2014\
        \ The rapid growth of the drapery trade of Liverpool, and the establishment\
        \ of what is known in this connection as working-men houses, is attaining\
        \ some prominence in the business of the city. Prominent among such estab\
        \ lishments is that of Mr. George Hague. This business was established so\
        \ far back as 1840 by Mr. James W. Bell, who continued it down to 1872, when\
        \ the present proprietor acquired it by purchase. This is purely a working-man\
        \ house, doing an extensive business in moleskins and other articles of labouring\
        \ apparel. There is no more reliable stock in this connection in Liverpool,\
        \ and the ready-made department is one of the most representative in the trade.\
        \ Bespoke orders are entrusted to this establishment, and for style, finish,\
        \ and durability, the goods of the house have secured the highest recognition.\
        \ With the working element of the North End there is no more popular concern,\
        \ and the business transacted is of the most extensive and valuable character.\
        \ The concern has a perpetual run of trade, and at any hour during the day\
        \ the pro prietor and his staff of assistants are constantly engaged supplying\
        \ the demands of a most fluctuating patronage. Mr. Hague is one of the most\
        \ popular traders in the north end of tbe city, and his name is a household\
        \ word in the locality. Bichard Wilds, Lithographic Writer, 16, Cook Street.\
        \ \u2014 Mr. Wilds has been established in business since the year 1876. He\
        \ is a lithographic writer and illuminator, and has formed a splendid con\
        \ nection, so that his business\u2014 if it continues to increase in the future\
        \ as it has done in the past \u2014 will soon become, in its line, one of\
        \ the largest in the city. He occupies spacious and handsome offices in Cook\
        \ Street, and they are neatly and conveniently fitted up, and he employs a\
        \ considerable number of assistants. He has the reputation of being one of\
        \ the most expert writers in Liverpool, and certainly the work executed at\
        \ his establishment is of a very high order of merit. No better test, however,\
        \ of his skill and ability is required than that which is evidenced by the\
        \ extensive patronage he receives. Not only is his work executed in splendid\
        \ style, but he is most reasonable in his charges, which is a recommendation\
        \ of no small importance. Mr. Wilds is a gentleman Harrison & Benjamin, Carvers\
        \ and Gilders, and Picture Frame Manufacturers, 26, Great George Street. \u2014\
        \ Messrs. Harrison and Benjamin carry on a successful business as carvers\
        \ and gilders and picture frame manufacturers, and although only established\
        \ three years ao*o seem to have made considerable headway. They have a very\
        \ good stock of frames and specimens of their handicraft, also a varied assortment\
        \ of maple and rosewood mouldings. They have a good local connection and a\
        \ fair private business, as well as working largely for the trade. Considering\
        \ the short time this concern has been established, it has progressed favourably\
        \ and bears a good name.", 1]

        \ find an excedent reading-room, to which they have free access by simply\
        \ giving their names to the librarian On the first floor of this building\
        \ is a concert-room containing a fine organ, and adorned with ld'e-size portraits\
        \ of the Queen, Prince Albert, and other members of the Royal Family. These\
        \ were painted by Mr. Dowling, a native of Laun ceston, who made himself a\
        \ name in England as an artist of merit, and died there in 1886. A large painting\
        \ of a group of Tasmanian aborigines, which hangs in the reading-room, is\
        \ the work of the same artist, and is the more interesting from the fact that\
        \ the race is extinct, and that aU the figures are actual portraits. The Government\
        \ Offices in Launceston are large and commodious, but not re markable for\
        \ architectural beauty. They include the Post Office, Telegraph, Law, Survey,\
        \ and Mining Departments. Of the ecclesiastical architecture the less said\
        \ the better. The Wesleyans have a pretty church, budt of red terra-cotta\
        \ bricks, with stone facings, and surmounted by a graceful spire. Of the other\
        \ churches, one or two may perhaps be considered as falling short of absolute\
        \ ugliness. If we proceed westward along Patterson Street we come to an Invalid\
        \ Depot, a Government institution, in which a number of aged and infirm persons\
        \ are main tained at the public expense. Attached to the Depot is a large\
        \ pleasure-ground, where open air concerts are given in the summer months.\
        \ Proceeding still along Patterson Street, we come in sight of a graceful\
        \ iron bridge thrown across the mouth of the South Esk, where it discharges\
        \ itself into the Tamar. In front of us rises steep, rocky Cataract Hid, already\
        \ mentioned as closing the western end of the town ; and through a narrow\
        \ gorge in it rushes the South Esk River. This gorge, of the nature of one\
        \ of those canons of the Rocky Mountains about which we read so much in American\
        \ literature, is a colossal rift between opposing cliff's of black volcanic\
        \ rock. It is shut in by basaltic rocks rising on the south side to a height\
        \ of about 490 feet. Half-a-mile up the gorge is a transverse barrier of rock,\
        \ which forms the cataract. Above this is a large pool, called the First Basin,\
        \ and stdl further up are the Second and Third Basins, ad of volcanic origin.\
        \ In the course of 1886 a new esplanade was constructed by the Municipal Council\
        \ along the right bank of the South Esk as far as the First Basin. This track\
        \ is a favourite resort of the townspeople and of visitors, affording, as\
        \ it does, easy access to a spot whence a grand view is obtainable of the\
        \ scenery of the gorge, and also of the city, spreading over its amphitheatre\
        \ of hills. The Basin itself is a large pool of water, lying in the midst\
        \ of steep, high hills crowned with wood. Its elevation above the Tamar is\
        \ forty feet. Its clean pure waters look black on account of the shadows of\
        \ the surrounding heights ; and on a fine day we see the hifls and woods distinctly\
        \ reflected in the seemingly unfathomable depths of the pool. The Second Basin\
        \ is comparatively little visited. It lies three or four miles out of town,\
        \ and requires a rough scramble to reach it, but it well repays the trouble.\

    - ["Dunedin.] ARCHITECTURAL. 287 of New Zealand (without the \"Colonial\") has\
        \ its head-quarters in Auckland. It is the principal financial house in the\
        \ colony, and keeps the Government account. The Dunedin establishment is only\
        \ a branch office, but this docs not prevent it from being the handsomest\
        \ budding in the town, admirably suited to its purpose, and constructed with\
        \ excellent taste in every detail. A remarkable structure is the head office\
        \ of the Union Steamship Company\u2014 the company which enjoys the monopoly\
        \ of the inter-colonial and coast traffic. The architect has succeeded in\
        \ giving the building a maritime air, by means of a number of little turrets\
        \ surmounted by weathercocks. There are many more fine commercial buildings:\
        \ insurance offices on a much larger scale than a prudent share holder can\
        \ approve; warehouses than which there are none larger in Melbourne and Sydney.\
        \ But buildings of this type are all very much like each other, anel a de\
        \ scription of the petty differences which distinguish them could only weary\
        \ the reader. Somewhat out of the ordinary, however, is the interior of Messrs.\
        \ Sievwright, Stout, and Co.'s office. These gentlemen are lawyers, but they\
        \ have cast aside the old world traditions as to legal offices, and built\
        \ theirs after the model of a bank, there being a large central hall, into\
        \ which the light is let through a stained glass roof, with a large counter\
        \ at the end of the ground floor, and offices round. But we ought to see the\
        \ public buildings first. Walking up Princes Street, we come to the Octagon,\
        \ an eight-sided \" square,\" which might be made very pretty if it were entrusted\
        \ to the care of a good gardener. On the upper side of the Octagon is the\
        \ Town Hall, or rather its facade, for the hall itself is not likely to be\
        \ built for many a year to come. Nevertheless, the front is very imposing,\
        \ anel the chances are that you do not notice the posterior deficiencies of\
        \ the building unless some apolo getic cicerone calls attention to them. This\
        \ Town Hall is no bad emblem of the history of the province, with its \"grand\"\
        \ ideas and love of putting its best foot foremost. In the sixties and seventies\
        \ everyone thought that Dunedin was going to be a little London, but the eighties\
        \ have changed all that, and many are the citizens who have begun their private\
        \ town-halls in the sanguine belief of indefinite progress, and were stopped\
        \ short in the building by subsequent \" bad times.\" On the lower side of\
        \ the Octagon is the Athen\xE6um, of which no Dunedin citizen cares to have\
        \ more notice taken than he can help. It is the only approach to a public\
        \ library that this fine town can boast, but it is an approach carefully guarded\
        \ from those who most need it by a guinea subscription, whilst both the quality\
        \ and the condition of the books leave something to be desired. There is,\
        \ however, a reading-room with newspapers and magazines, to which visitors\
        \ to the town can have free access by giving their names to the librarian.\
        \ At the University there is a library containing some good books, but it\
        \ has been starved ever since the depression set in. In the Supreme Court,\
        \ again, there is a legal library, to which one can get access without much\
        \ difficulty. But it remains the darkest blot upon the fair fame of Dunedin\
        \ that it has no public library. Although laid out on level ground, the public\

        Crown " of Demosthenes, and also the prize for an English poetical translation
        of Goethe''s " Iphigenie aufTauris." During his University career Mr. Shiels
        broke down in health from over-study, and under medical advice he had to abandon
        study and went to reside in South Australia for several years. After his return
        he was called to the Bar in 1873, and prac- tised his profession in Melbourne
        for several years, until public life and the claims of his constituency made
        too great an inroad upon the time his health allowed him to devote to work.
        He first became a candidate for Parliament at the general election of 1877.
        He stood for his present constituency of Nor- manby professing Constitutional-Liberal
        principles in opposition to the " Stone- wall " policy of Mr. Berry''s party.
        He was second on the poll, Mr. Richmond Henty and Mr. Alfred Macpherson also
        being candidates and splitting the Constitutional vote, and Mr. Tytherleigh
        secured the seat. At the famous general election of 1880 he was returned,
        defeating Mr. Tytherleigh, Mr. Samuel, Mr. J. W. Hackett, and Mr. J. G. Gray;
        and he has been since re-elected for the constituency three times, on the
        last occasion his return being unopposed. Mr. Shiels'' maiden speech in Parliament
        was delivered on the nth May 1880, when the Service Government selected him
        to move the reply to the Governor''s speech. His first essay gave clear and
        abundant promise of oratorical power, and he was highly complimented both
        by politicians and in the press. In 1883 he succeeded in passing his first
        Act, a measure to amend the laws relating to children and to wives, and to
        divorce and matrimonial causes. Shiels'' Act was admittedly a decided advance
        upon the legislation previously in force, particu- larly in removing the barbarous
        anomaly under which mothers could be deprived of their children, even infants.
        Mr. Shiels was associated with Dr. Quick and Dr. Hearn in introducing a bill
        to prevent the abuse of the practice of cross-examination, but it was lost.
        With Dr. Hearn he next drafted the provisions of a bill to amend the Married
        Women''s Property Act, but Mr. Kerferd, the Attorney-General, took up the
        subject, and passed a measure on the lines of English legislation. During
        the session of 1887 Mr. Shiels had three bills in hand, the Divorce Bill,
        the Absconding Debtors'' Bill, and the Slander Bill. He took prominent action
        on the Sunday question in 1883 and 1884 in favour of opening the public museum
        and national gallery on Sundays, and also the running of Sunday trains, and
        delivered some excellent speeches in the House, one ofwhich was printed and
        30,000 copies published by the Sunday Society. At the opening of the session
        of 1886 he, in a brilliant and epigram- matic address, energetically denounced
        the formation of a second Coalition Government. mercial pursuits in Glasgow
        in 1846, and in 1853 came to Melbourne (see James Service and Co.) Soon after
        his arrival he was elected chairman of the new municipality of Emerald Hill,
        was appointed a territorial magistrate in the same year, and the year following
        was again elected chairman. At that time the action of the Hobson''s Bay railway
        company in proposing to cut up the streets at ill-chosen levels, was strenuously
        opposed by Mr. Service and other gentlemen, who ultimately succeeded in preventing
        it. In 1857, when Mr. (now Sir) William F. Stawell was appointed Chief Justice
        of Victoria, a vacancy was created in the Legislative Assembly for the representation
        of Melbourne, and Mr. Service, contesting the seat with Mr. James Murphy,
        was elected. He next seconded the vote of want of confidence in the O''Shannassy
        administration, which was carried 29th April 1857. The second Haines ministry
        succeeded, and lasted eleven months, being followed by the second O''Shanassy
        ministry. By this time the new electoral bill divided Melbourne into three
        electorates, east, west and north, and at the following general election Mr.
        Service contested Emerald Hill against Mr. Anderson, who defeated him by sixty
        votes. He was then asked simultaneously to stand for Avoca and for Ripon and
        Hampden, and selecting the latter electorate was returned, and represented
        it until 1862, when he left for England. In October 1859 he accepted office
        in the Nicholson administration as Minister of Lands and president of the
        Board of Land and Works, and introduced the first land bill providing for
        selection. Then ensued the contest with the Upper House about the order-in-council
        which was to give the Government of the day power to lease for not more than
        one year. Mr. Nicholson leant towards the pastoral tenants, the consequence
        being that Mr. Service and Mr. J. G. Francis resigned office, after a tenure
        of ten months, and they were, on retiring, each presented with a handsome
        testimonial from their colleagues in the Nicholson ministry. To Mr. Service
        is due the credit of taking charge of, and passing through the Victorian parliament,
        Torrens'' Transfer of Real Property Act, which service he performed whilst
        a private member. When he was about to leave for England in 1862, his constituents
        in Ripon and Hampden wished to give him a year''s leave of absence in order
        that he might not sever his connection with them, but he preferred to resign.
        On his return to the colony in March 1865, he found politics at boiling point,
        owing to the introduction of the new protective tariff, and the proposal to
        tack it to the Appropriation Bill. At Ballarat east, which he soon after contested,
        he opposed both tariff and tack, but was defeated by Mr. Vale. He sustained
        a second defeat at Collingwood, and a third at West Melbourne, but at the
        general election in 1874 he was returned for Maldon, and took office as treasurer
        during Mr. Kerferd''s administration. On going to his constituents he was
        returned unopposed, and held office until the formation of Mr. Berry''s first
        government in August 1875. He was again returned for that place in 1877 without
        a contest. During the period of the great conflict between the two Houses,
        the reform agitation, the proposed amendment of the constitution, and the
        Berry- Pearson embassy. Mr. Service sat in opposition to the Berry party,
        and took a leading part against their proposed Constitution Act measure, until
        it fell through. In March 1880 Mr. Berry resigned, and Mr. Service formed
        his first ministry, and was succeeded by Mr. Berry 3rd August of the same
        year. After the O''Loghlen cabinet, which "lasted until 3rd April 1883, Mr.
        Service and Mr. Berry coalesced, the combination being an undoubtedly strong
        one. In April 1886 Mr. Service resigned his post in the ministry, and proceeded
        to England on a visit, returning in 1888. He was elected a member of the Legislative
        Council to represent the Melbourne province in May 1888. Mr. Service has from
        the sir^t taken a leading part in the administration. His name connects itself
        in the closest manner with the matters relating to New Guinea the federation
        of the Australian colonies, the Land Bill, and the Federal Council Bill. He
        has earned repute for sterling public and private worth, and is one of those
        merchant princes who, in all countries, add so much to the vertebrate strength
        of the State, in the public life of which they take a worthy part. Though
        a constitutionalist in politics, Mr. Service is a democratic statesman in
        the broad sense of the term, and respectfully declined the honour of knighthood
        offered him as a slight recognition of his services on behalf of the Empire.
        His portrait will be found in Vol. I. of this work. Shillinglaw, John Joseph,
        F.R.G.S., Melbourne, is descended from a Border family, who, since 1689, have
        been settled at Birkhillside. He was born in London in 1830, and as a boy
        was eight years with Admiral Washington, the hydrographer to the navy, but
        resigned his appointment at the Admiralty to emigrate with his father and
        family, seven in number, to Victoria, where they arrived in October 1852.
        He is the eldest son of the well-known geographer, who was for many years
        librarian to the Royal Geographical Society, and who died in this colony in
        1862. Mr. J. J. Shillinglaw was, soon after his arrival, appointed chief clerk
        of the bench at Williamstown, where, at that time, a vast number of important
        cases affecting passengers, crews, and commerce generally, were dealt with.
        In 1854 he relieved Lieut. Pasco, R.N., of the charge of the water police
        of the colony, and was acting superintendent until the appointment of Lieut.
        Crawford, R.N. The Hobson''s Bay of those days was a forest of masts, as many
        as 600 ships lay at anchor there at one time, and thousands of people were
        arriving daily. To many an old colonist the sight of the police boat, or the
        health officer alongside, was the first incident of life in the new land.
        The duty was hard and incessant, and Mr. Shillinglaw''s published sketches
        of scenes and characters in these exciting times have been read with interest.
        In February 1856 he was selected as Government shipping master to administer
        certain of the Imperial laws relating to seamen, then just adopted in Victoria,
        and in this position he remained until, on a general reduction in the departments
        in 1869, he retired from the civil service with compensation. For some years
        he also acted as secretary to the Government steam navigation board, and has
        served on the committees of several local institutions. He was re-appointed
        to the civil service in 1875, and successively held the appointments of secretary
        to the police superannuation and police medical boards, and the Central Board
        of Health. He is now secretary to the Royal commission on vegetable products,
        and to the board of viticulture. In 1853, in conjunction with Lieut. Pasco,
        he first brought before Governor Latrobe the necessity of a sailors'' home
        for the port, and in 1869, on quitting office, the seamen of Melbourne testified
        that he was known in every sea as the "sailors'' friend." In 1870 he became
        proprietor and editor of the " Colonial Monthly" magazine. His literary work
        consists of contributions to various home and colonial newspapers and magazines.
        "Household Words," the Australasian, Sec, and the "London Quarterly" and "Edinburgh
        Review" have spoken well of his book on "Arctic Discovery," the first edition
        ofwhich was published in 1850. He edited (1865) "Cast away on the Aucklands,"
        a book which the Times said was as interesting as " Robinson Crusoe," and
        in 1858 wrote a "Shipmaster''s Guide" for Victorian mariners. In 1878 he made
        a happy discovery of some early annals of the colony, which were printed by

        He landed in Sydney three years previous to that date, his father commanding
        the 57th Regiment there so early as 1825. Mr. Shadforth was vice-president
        of the Old Colonists'' Association, and afterwards president. He resigned
        his seat as a member of the council on his leaving for England. He is now
        a police magistrate for the colony and a member of the Metropolitan Licensing
        Court. His residence is in Charnwood Crescent, St. Kilda. Shiels, William,
        M.L. A., Melbourne, was born in Ireland about 1849, and came to Victoria with
        his parents when he was four or sive years of age. He was educated at the
        Scotch College, Melbourne, and subsequently at the Melbourne University, where
        he took his degrees of LL.B. and Master of Laws, and where he carried off
        numerous honours, amongst others a double first in the second year in arts
        and law-., and in the following year the vice-chancellor''s', 1]

        \ of the Australian wine trade in Melbourne. In those days the business was\
        \ very small in comparison with what it is now, wine-growing being then in\
        \ its infancy, and growers having much to learn from experience. Mr. Blake,\
        \ of the Irrawong vineyard, Hunter River, N.S.W., succeeded Mr. Bear, and\
        \ he in turn was followed by Messrs. G. W. and T. G. Knight, the former a\
        \ well-known florist of Sandhurst, and the latter the present Government resident\
        \ at Port Darwin. These gentlemen made grea efforts to push the wine industry,\

        \ had been some years in their service. The business was then removed to Market-square,\
        \ and in 1879 to 99* Collins-street west. Mr. Gooch has persevered in pushing\
        \ the wine industry among the distributing houses, licensed grocers and hotelkeepers,\
        \ until now, after many years of hard work on his part, there are few of these\
        \ in Melbourne and suburbs who do not sell Australian wines. The firm has\
        \ avoided owning vineyards, deeming that by that course they are more at liberty\
        \ to select from vineyards in various districts, and thus obtain the best\
        \ qualities to be had. Mr. Gooch was appointed one of the wine jurors in the\

        \ were laid, it may be mentioned that they run almost parallel with the lines\
        \ of railroad that have since been adopted. About the end of 1853 Mr. Skene\
        \ was placed in charge of the district survey office at Geelong, his duty\
        \ being to superintend extensive surveys then being carried on in the western\

        \ and came to Victoria in 1851, just before the gold-dig ging days. For many\
        \ years he had an extensive practice, and was a member of the Melbourne University\
        \ from its establishment. He sounded the Collingwood free medical mission\
        \ dispensary twenty years ago, where 146,000 of the sick poor who attended\
        \ it received free medicine and treatment. The present attendance is about\
        \ 10,000 per annum. The great success attending this treatment (the same as\
        \ that adopted by the Temperance hospital, London) through all its course\
        \ has been attributed to the prompt non-alcoholic treat ment of all diseases,\
        \ especially typhoid fever, the death-rate ofwhich did not exceed five per\
        \ cent. The moral and social results from it, and from the adjoining Mission\
        \ hall, were most marked. During his close attendance there, Dr. Singleton\
        \ also founded the hospital for sick children, assisted by Dr. C. Smith as\
        \ surgeon, himself being physician, until seeing it fairly established, and\
        \ that other medical men would gladly take his place, he, after eighteen months'\
        \ hard work, resigned it to other hands, on account of his various engage\
        \ ments. The sanitary improvements among the poor, temperance work, and other\
        \ philanthropic labours have occupied very much of his time, and he has influenced\
        \ public opinion to a considerable extent by his letters on the non-alcoholic\
        \ treatment of disease. Among the various papers he has read at the Medical\
        \ Society, that on alcohol as a medicine, and that on the treatment of fever\
        \ at the Collingwood medical free dispensary, were reprinted from the Medical\
        \ Gazette by Dr. Singleton, and sent to about 1500 medical men in Victoria,\
        \ and the other Australian colonies. Assisted by other medical practitioners,\

        \ of his age, and won classical honours during his undergraduate course, and\
        \ the degree of B.A. in 1837. He was next a student of King's Inn, Dublin,\
        \ and of Lincoln's Inn, London, and was called to the bar in 1839. He practised\
        \ in Ireland until 1842, and arrived in Melbourne December 1842. He almost\

        \ and subsequently at the Melbourne University, where he graduated in 1873.\
        \ In the same year he was appointed assistant librarian of the University,\
        \ and later, assistant registrar, both of which positions he held until August\
        \ 1881, when he was appointed librarian of the Melbourne Public Library, and\
        \ has held that office ever since. In 1879 Dr. Bride took the degree of doctor\
        \ of laws, being the third who achieved that distinction at the Melbourne\
        \ University. Bromby, Rev. Dr. J. E., Melbourne, landed in Victoria in February\
        \ 1858, and the Church of England grammar school, over which he had been elected\
        \ to preside, was opened after the following Easter vacation. His object in\
        \ coming to this colony was to have his five sons educated under his own eye,\
        \ which would have been impracticable in the old country. Being acquainted\
        \ with the family of the then Bishop of Melbourne, and hearing that his brother,\
        \ Archdeacon Cooper, was, with others, com missioned to appoint ahead master\
        \ to the Melbourne grammar school, he took occasion on that gentleman's visiting\
        \ his relatives in his (Dr. Bromby's) native town of Hull, to say to him that,\
        \ if he should be thought a fit person, he should be ready to undertake the\
        \ duty. He was strongly dissuaded, but after some difficulties the offer he\
        \ had made privately to Dr. Cooper was reconsidered and accepted, and ere\
        \ long he had wound up his affairs in England, and was afloat, with his wife,\
        \ ten children, and two servants, bound for Australia. They encountered a\
        \ heavy gale in the Channel, but with no greater mishap than the loss of an\
        \ anchor, arrived in Melbourne 1st February 1858. He was received with great\
        \ kindness and consideration, especially by Bishop Perry and the Hon. T. T.\
        \ A'Beckett, who expressed particular gratification that he looked so young,\
        \ for they had been under the impression that he was too old for the task\
        \ he had undertaken; and he, for his part, was equally gratified on entering\
        \ the school grounds to find a handsome structure in place of the miserable\
        \ tenement of four or five rooms he had been led to expect. On entering on\
        \ his duties at the grammar school, his first difficulty was to find church\
        \ accommodation for the boarders ; Christ Church, South Yarra, was then of\
        \ small dimensions ; St. Luke's, Emerald Hill, was still smaller ; but St.\
        \ Paul's, through the patriarchal kindness of the Rev. Canon Chase, the incumbent,\
        \ opened its doors to them. On the removal of that gentleman to the incumbency\
        \ of St. John's, Dr. Bromby was, after a two years' locum tenancy at Toorak,\
        \ appointed to succeed him at St. Paul's, and has retained the charge ever\

        \ as missionaries to the sparsely populated parts of the colony. He assisted\
        \ Mr. (now Sir) Henry Parkes in establishing the Empire newspaper in Sydney,\
        \ and wrote for that journal a narrative of Hargreaves' discovery of gold\
        \ in New South Wales, taken down from that gentleman's own lips. In 1852 Mr.\
        \ Blair came to Victoria as correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald, and\
        \ became sub-editor of the Melbourne Argus. In 1854 he was appointed editor\
        \ of the Age, and during the struggle between the miners and the harsh gold-fields\
        \ legislation of the period warmly advocated the cause of the miners in that\
        \ paper, as well as by a speech at the mass meeting in Melbourne of 6th December\
        \ 1854. He was twice elected for Parliament, for Talbot in 1S56, and for Crowlands\
        \ in 1868. In 1867 he was appointed Secretary to the Royal Commission on Education,\
        \ and of the Penal Commission in 1S73, and has written ten reports on public\
        \ subjects. He wrote the first history of Australia in 1S7S, and in 1881 compiled\
        \ the Cyclop\xE6dia of Australasia. Mr. Blair is well-known in Victoria as\

        \ and dress are cheap. There is not much beach, as the town is principally\
        \ built round the bay on the cliffs, but gentlemen can get good bathing. House\
        \ rent is very reasonable. Of churches there are three : Upper and Lower Brixham,\
        \ and St. Peters ; this last is in connection with the mission to seamen,\
        \ for whom there is a cheap home. It was at Brixham that William, Prince of\
        \ Orange (afterwards King William III.), landed on November 5, 1688. The identical\
        \ stone on which he first set his foot on landing is preserved, placed in\
        \ a neat obelisk, with an inscription upon it recording the memorable event\
        \ of 1688, and is erected on the quay near the spot where the Prince landed.\
        \ A stalactite and bone cavern, discovered here in 1858, was leased for one\
        \ year by the Royal Geological Society, and thoroughly explored by that learned\
        \ body. The cavern exceeds 600 feet, and the interior is very curious in the\
        \ formation of stalactites, &c. It is well worth a visit, but tourists who\
        \ are not geologists are recommended to make a bargain as to the price of\
        \ admission before entering. To any traveller or invalid wanting a quiet seaside\
        \ spot and cheap lodgings and living, Brixham can be recommended ; the climate\
        \ is as good, if not better, for those suffering with delicate chests or in\
        \ con- sumption, than Torquay, and anyone not caring for the expense and fashion\
        \ of that town would revel in the snug and cosy quietness of Brixham. The\
        \ season is mostly from October to April, but the place is a desirable residence\
        \ at any time of the year. The fish market here is the great attraction, and\
        \ well worth visiting between nine and twelve in the morning, and about five\
        \ or six in the evening, just as the fish leaves for London ; and the long\
        \ shed near the quay where it is packed for the London market, presents quite\
        \ a pretty scene. Fish is usually plentiful and good. Good bass and other\
        \ fishing is obtainable. Pleasure or fishing boats can be hired. Walks and\
        \ drives round Brixham are numerous and very pretty, and there are many places\
        \ of interest in the neighbourhood worth visiting. Vehicles of all sorts can\
        \ be hired at a very reasonable rate at both hotels and other places ; they\
        \ are comfortable and well turned out, with good horses and drivers, The principal\
        \ place of interest within a walk is Berry Head, which is approached through\
        \ a pic- turesque ruined arch over a drawbridge ; inside, on the inclosed\
        \ open space, are ruined cottages, restored partly for habitation, which were\
        \ once fortifications. The sea view from this headland is magnificent, being\
        \ quite unequalled at any point on the South Coast. There are, near, the pretty\
        \ towns of Kingswear, Dartmouth, Paignton, Torquay, and others, which can\
        \ be reached either by rail or road. The principal hotels are the Queen's,\
        \ the Bolton, the George, and the Globe. Lodgings are good and reasonable.\

        \ is situated about midway between Saltburn and Redcar, and is distant from\
        \ London 254 miles. It may be reached by the Great Northern or the Midland\
        \ and North Eastern Railways ; most of the Saltburn trains stop at Marske.\
        \ The journey occupies about seven hours. The expanse of sands is perhaps\
        \ unrivalled in England, stretching, as they do, three miles each way, and\
        \ the bathing is splendid. Boats may be hired at a cheap rate. Although small,\
        \ the town has some good shops. It is a much older place, and has the advantage\
        \ of being rather more sheltered, than either Redcar or Saltburn. The attractions\
        \ of these places are easily accessible to visitors, being within five minutes'\
        \ rail of Marske. Lodgings are not expensive, but the supply is not always\
        \ equal to the demand. In the summer a list of apartments is given in the\
        \ Saltburn Times. Mr. D. M. Jones will supply information to intending visitors.\

        \ on the coast of that romantic portion of the North Riding ofthe County of\
        \ York called Cleveland (Land of Cliffs). The district possesses so many natural\
        \ beauties, all of which are easily reached from Saltburn, as to make it a\
        \ peculiarly desirable spot for the annual holiday of the tourist, who need\
        \ not rely on the sea alone for recreation, but may equally enjoy the charms\
        \ of rural scenery. Thus happily placed betwixt the heather and the Northern\
        \ Sea, Saltburn owes to its situation its pre-eminent advantages as a watering\
        \ place \u2014 fine air, splendid views, broad, level sands, beautitul and\

        \ beauty of hill and dale, of moorland and ravine, is full of interest to\

        \ may be reached in about eight hours from London (distance 270 miles), the\
        \ route being by Great Northern to York, thence direct by North-Eastern. From\
        \ Manchester and Liverpool the route is by Leeds, from which place five or\
        \ six trains per day run to Saltburn. The railway is very convenient, and\
        \ the train service as good as can be wished for. Tourists' tickets are granted\
        \ from nearly all railway centres. Cabs are not often seen at the station,\
        \ as it is within three minutes' walk of any part of the town ; but flies\
        \ and riding horses may be always hired at a reasonable rate.", 1]

        \ when he is indebted for good offices, the i The following sketch of Sir.\
        \ Hoy's life and char acter is from the pen of Dr. Carruthers of Inver ness:\
        \ \u2014 \" The late Mr. James Hoy, librarian to the Duke of Gordon, was,\
        \ in many respects, a singular and ori ginal character. In goodness of heart,\
        \ and simplicity of manners, he was not unlike Dominie Sampson himself; and,\
        \ during the long period of forty-six years, during which he was the inmate\
        \ of a ducal mansion, he lost not a shade of his originality, or abated one\
        \ jot of his stoical indifference to riches. The love of learning and of virtue\
        \ which distinguished Mr. Hoy, added to his simple and primitive habits, rendered\
        \ him universally respected and noted in the neighbourhood of Gordon Castle\
        \ ; and in the noble family in which he resided he maintained all the same\
        \ familiar footing that his celebrated prototype, whom we have named above,\
        \ preserved at Ellan gowan. Mr. Hoy was born at Haining, in Selkirk shire,\
        \ in the year 1747. His father was gardener to Pringle of Haining, or Clifton,\
        \ afterwards Lord Ail more, one of the lords of Session, and his lordship's\
        \ daughter, Miss Violet Pringle, observing young Hoy to be a steady sedate\
        \ lad, had him educated, accor ding to his parents' wishes, for the dissenting\
        \ church. Lord Ailmore becoming blind, young Hoy was en gaged to be his reader\
        \ and companion. Even at this early period he must have discovered considerable\
        \ signs of scientific genius, for he had an offer to go to Ireland with Banks\
        \ and Solander as botanist, and to assist in other departments of science.\
        \ The duke's song,2 independent totally of his ttte a ttte over their bottle\
        \ of claret together after dinner, to fill the duke with all that was worth\
        \ remembering, and his grace's memory was such that it never afterwards lost\
        \ what it thus received. \"Mr. Hoy's chief sciences were astronomy, entomol\
        \ ogy, and botany. To the first of these he adhered steadily to his dying\
        \ day, and made almost daily observations on the heavenly bodies, and from\
        \ his having undertaken the regulation of the clocks at Gordon Castle and\
        \ Fochabers, it was matter of notor iety that his was the only accurately\
        \ kept time in the north of Scotland. \"We need scarcely say that Mr. Hoy\
        \ was quite in different to fame ; he equally despised riches, never seeking\
        \ for more than might enable him to dispense some charities, and to afford\
        \ himself respectable clothes, of which he never had more than two suits at\
        \ a time. When his kind and indulgent patron vol untarily offered him an addition\
        \ to his sixty-pound sal ary, he replied, ' Keep it to yoursel', my lord duke,\
        \ I'm no needin' mair; ye hae as muckle need o't as I hae.' When Burns was\
        \ at Gordon Castle he was particu larly delighted with Hoy's blunt manner,\
        \ and perhaps the circumstance of his being a native of the Borders gave him\
        \ an additional value in the poet's estima tion. Mr. Hoy left orders in his\
        \ will that his remains should be interred in the churchyard of the cathedral\
        \ 'near his auld frien' Mr. Duncan,' the Seceder minister, to whom he had\
        \ listened so many years of his life, in defiance of the wind, rain, snow,\
        \ or sun shine that may have vainly assailed him during his hebdomadal rides\
        \ to Elgin. \" It was as a sort of literary companion, and as one able to\
        \ scale the different heights and bearings round Gordon Castle, that Mr. Hoy\
        \ was recommended to the duke, and scarcely any other situation could have\
        \ been so admirably calculated to promote his own happiness ; for, as his\
        \ whole enjoyment was in books, so that which was his delight now became his\
        \ duty. To him the charge of the duke's library was committed. It became the\
        \ castle of which he was appointed gov ernor, and he was never out of his\
        \ garrison except at meal-times, or when called into the fields by his scientific\
        \ pursuits, or on Sundays, when he never failed, let the weather be what it\
        \ might, to mount his horse, to ride to Elgin to attend the Seceder meeting-house.\
        \ As the duke's engagements and oc cupations deprived him of sufficient leisure\
        \ to peruse the numerous books of miscellaneous information which were continually\
        \ appearing, it became Mr. Hoy's business to devote his forenoons to reading\
        \ them as they arrived ; and then he was enabled, as they sat \" The old librarian\
        \ followed his noble master to the grave, after the interval of a few short\
        \ months, and we cannot take our leave of him better than in the well-known\

        \ appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for\

    - ['GENERAL COEEESPONDENCE 189 Nithsdale.1 I beg leave to send it to you, because
        it is new, and may be useful. How far it is deserving of a place in your patriotic
        publication, you are the best judge. mcnccment. What authors they were to
        pur chase, was always decided by the majority. At every meeting, all the books,
        under certain fines and forfeitures, by way of penalty, were to be produced
        ; and the members had their choice of the volumes in rotation. He whose name
        stood for thatj night, first on the list, had his choice of what volume he
        pleased in the whole collection ; the second had his choice after the first
        ; the third after the second, and so on to the last. At next meeting he who
        had been first on the list at the preceding meeting, was last at this; he
        who had been second was first ; and so on through the whole three years. At
        the expiration of the engage ment, the books were sold by auction, but only
        among the members themselves; and each man had his share of the common stock,
        in money or in books, as he chose to be a pur chaser or not. To store the
        minds of the lower classes with useful knowledge, is certainly of very great
        importance, both to them as individuals, and to society at large. Giving them
        a turn for reading and reflection, is giving them a source of innocent and
        laudable amusement; and besides, raises them to a more dignified degree in
        the scale of rationality. Impressed with this idea, a gentleman in this parish,
        Robert Riddell, Esq. of Glenriddell, set on foot a species of circulating
        library, on a plan so simple as to be practicable in any corner of the country;
        and so useful, as to deserve the notice of every country gentleman, who thinks
        the improvement of that part of his own species whom chance has thrown into
        the humble walks of the peasant and the artizan, a matter worthy of his attention.
        At the breaking up of this little society which was formed under Mr. Riddell''s
        patron age, what with benefactions of books from him, and what with their
        own purchases, they had collected together upwards of one hundred and fifty
        volumes. It will easily be guessed, that a good deal of trash would be bought.
        Among the books, however, of this little library, were Blair''s Sermons, Robertson''s
        History of Scot land, Hume''s History of the Stuarts, The Spectator, Idler,
        Adventurer, Mirror, Lounger, Observer, Man of Feeling, Man ofthe World, Chrysal,
        Don Quixote, Joseph Andrews, &c. A peasant who can read, and enjoy such books,
        is certainly a much superior being to his neigh bour, who perhaps stalks beside
        his team, very little removed, except in shape, from the brutes he drives.
        Mr. Riddell got a number of his own tenants, and farming neighbours, to form
        themselves into a society for the purpose of having a library among themselves.
        They entered into a legal engagement to abide by it for three years ; with
        a saving clause or two, in case of removal to a distance, or of death. Each
        member, at his entry, paid five shillings ; and at each of their meetings,
        which were held every fourth Saturday, sixpence more. With their entry-money,
        and the credit which they took on the faith of their future funds, they laid
        in a tolerable stock of books at the com- contains an account of a small library,
        which he was so good (at my desire) as to set on foot, in the barony of Monklaud,
        or Friar''s Carse, in this parish. As its utility has been felt, particularly
        among the younger class of people, I think, that if a similar plan were established
        in the different parishes of Scotland, it would tend greatly to the speedy
        improvement of the tenantry, trades-people, and work-people. Mr. Burns was
        so good as take the whole charge of this small concern. He was treasurer,
        librarian, and censor to this little society, who will long have a grateful
        sense of his public spirit and exertions for their improvement and information.

        \ of Old England. To the principal librarian I pointed out that if they were\
        \ so antique, they would be more likely to mislead and injure an enemy than\
        \ assist him ; for the enemy would certainly fall into a trap if he expected\
        \ to find things as they were a hundred years ago. And the gentleman concurred\
        \ in my belief, but stated that the book was sealed by order of the Government,\
        \ and that without an order from the Government it would not be opened. Denials\
        \ whet desire, and I was now hankering feverishly for the forbidden fruit.\
        \ I wrote an argumentative letter to the librarian, formally applying for\
        \ permission to open the sealed packet, mentioning as references all the best\
        \ men I could think of, including one or two War Office and Admiralty people,\
        \ who could testify that I was neither a Russian nor a Soudanese. Then I handed\
        \ in the letter, returned the book with the seal intact, received my voucher,\
        \ and went home to wait. Next day the postman brought me word from the librarian\
        \ that my application had been forwarded to the War Office, and for a whole\
        \ month the War Office was debating this momentous matter, until at last a\
        \ little friendly influence settled the point in my favour. An officer, who\
        \ was fortunately familiar with modern Woolwich, was sent to the British Museum,\
        \ and I had the extreme satisfaction of seeing the sealed packet ripped open\
        \ and its contents disclosed. The first sheet which I opened was \u2014 Au\
        \ exact plan of the town of Woolwich, His Majesty's Dockyard and Ropewalk,\

        \ laid out according to the fancy of the dead and forgotten occupier ; and\
        \ a thousand details for study, reflection, and deduction. But I hurried on,\
        \ and, after passing two or three more plans, I came upon \u2014 The North\

        \ nume rous biographical sketches began to appear in the periodical press.\
        \ In Oct. and Nov. 1796, there appeared in the Aberdeen Magazine a sketch\
        \ of his Life and Writings, said to be from the pen of Bishop John Skinner,\
        \ son of the author of \"Tullochgorum,\" and who had met the poet during his\
        \ Northern tour. In January, 1797, \"Some account of the Life and Writings\
        \ of Robert Burns, the Ayrshire poet \" formed the leading paper in the Scots\
        \ Maga zine, while in the Monthly Magazine for March and July of the same\
        \ year an \"Original Memoir of the late Robert Burns,\" initialed \"H.,\"\
        \ formed an important item. The author was Robert Heron, a personal acquaintance\
        \ of the poet, and his memoir was published afterwards in a thin octavo volume\
        \ (Edin. 1797). Cham bers characterizes it as \"a very rare and inter esting\
        \ composition, which is often quoted, but seldom seen, \" and which presents\
        \ ' ' not only an uncommonly- clear view of the life and charac ter of Burns,\
        \ but also a specimen of the ani mated and nervous, though somewhat turgid,\
        \ style of Heron, whose literary history is scarcely less remarkable than\
        \ that of Burns. \" Josiah Walker, latterly professor of Hu manity- in the\
        \ University of Glasgow, was in troduced to Burns by Dr. Blacklock in Edin\
        \ burgh in 1787. They- again met at Blair during Burns's Northern tour, Walker\
        \ being then acting in the capacity of tutor in the Duke of Athole's family.\
        \ He also visited the poet towards the end of 1795 in Dumfries. In 1811 he\
        \ produced a Life of Burns, which was published in the edition of Burns issued\
        \ at Edinburgh for the trustees of James Morison (of Perth, who had projected\
        \ it) in two vols. 8vo. This life is severely handled in Profes sor Wilson's\
        \ Essay, published in this edition. Alexander Peterkin, Sheriff-substitute\
        \ of Orkney, published an edition of Burns in 1813 with a Life, which, among\
        \ other new matter, contained letters relating to the later years of the poet's\
        \ life by- Findlater, and James Gray. The Rev. Hamilton Paul, the Ayrshire\
        \ clerical humorist and poet, prefixed a Life of Burns to an edition of his\
        \ works published at Ayr in 1819. It contained a variety of par ticulars inaccessible\
        \ to previous biographers. In 1800 appeared Currie's celebrated edition with\
        \ Life by the editor. Dr. Currie became personally- acquainted with Burns\
        \ in 1792, and upon the death of the poet he was induced, at the request of\
        \ his old friend Mr. Syme, to be come the editor of a complete edition of\
        \ the poet's works, to which he added a memoir. This memoir was executed with\
        \ surprising delicacy- towards the memory of the poet and the feelings of\
        \ his surviving friends, as well as with due consideration for the interests\
        \ of truth and virtue. Currie's edition long re tained its place as the standard\
        \ version of the Life and Works of Burns. Thomas Campbell, the poet, gave\
        \ a short \"Life of Robert Burns\" in his Specimens of the British Poets:\
        \ with biographical and critical notices, 1819. John Gibson Lockhart's \"\
        Life of Robert Burns\" was written for Constable's Miscellany and was published\
        \ in 1828 in two forms \u2014 the one in 16mo (vol. xxiii. of the Miscellany),\
        \ and the other in 8vo to match with the volumes of Currie and Cromek. A revised\

        interested himself successfully to secure a fund of Sio,ooo or $11,000 as
        an endowment for reading-rooms. The money subscribed was carefully invested,
        and the income of it spent in furnishing the rooms with American and foreign
        papers and periodicals. Mr. Green, the librarian, in a paper which he wrote
        in 1875, states that " besides the more obvious advantages which accrue from
        reading-rooms, considered by themselves, it is noteworthy that, in combination
        with libraries, they serve, as do well supplied circulating departments, to
        bring the institutions with which they are connected into contact with large
        portions of the community which would not otherwise see that they are getting
        benefit enough from them to make them willing to contribute liberally towards
        their support." A Public library is dependent upon popular favor for its existence.
        It must be so administered as to secure this favor. Mr. Green adds, however,
        that " this does not mean that you must lower the standard of periodicals
        and books bought. Keep the standard high. Books and papers may be popular
        without being trashy or immoral." Dr. Green died in the fall of 1865. He had
        given to the library from time to time, between the date of his original gift
        and that of his death, four thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight volumes,
        in addition to the seven thousand contributed at the start. By his will he
        left to the city of Worcester the sum of thirty thousand dollars, to be invested
        carefully and known as the Green Library Fund, for the benefit of the reference
        or Green Library. One of the provisions of the will is, that one fourth of
        the income from the Green Library Fund shall be added to the principal annually,
        and that the remain- ing three-fourths, after deducting any losses that may
        have been sustained by the principal, shall be spent for books. For several
        years the use of the reference library was very small. One reason for its
        neglect was that the room in which it was con tained was not properly heated.
        This defect was remedied. The directors also established reading-rooms, thinking
        that if they cultivated by means of these a taste for reading, the use of
        the Green Library would increase. This experi ment only succeeded partially
        ; for five or six years longer the books in the reference depart ment were
        little used. Then, however, there came a sudden growth in the use of that
        portion of the library, and the use has increased rapidly ever since. In 1870
        the first year of the in- crease, the reference library was used by seven
        thousand three hundred and twenty-one persons, and the following figures show
        the number of users for the four following years: 12,408, SAMUEL S. GREEN,
        A. M. IS, 672, 20,sso, 22,833. The reason for this remarkable growth may be

        \ in the South Meeting House, by Charles Allen, Esq., and the music was furnished\
        \ by the Worcester Harmonic Society. This must have been remarkably good,\
        \ for the Massachusetts Spy of the following week, in giving an account of\
        \ the celebration says : ' The music by the Worcester Harmonic Society was\
        \ led by their President, Mr. Emory Perry ; and we do not deem it too much\
        \ to say, that its power, effect, and general excellence, were sufficient\
        \ to satisfy the most refined amateur in that delightful art.' ' \"A concert\

        \ with them some fifteen years, since which time he has served in that capacity\

        \ are younger, when residents of the city, can upon giving satisfactory references,\
        \ draw books from the library to take to their homes without cost. The Public\
        \ Library has been for many years an indispensable feature of public education\
        \ in this city. Teachers, Normal School scholars, and pupils from all the\
        \ higher schools of learning, have for many years found here the books needed\
        \ by them for study or reference, and can always rely upon receiving at the\
        \ library cheerfully afforded assistance from the librarian and his assistants.\
        \ Mr. Green was desirous that the teachers and members of grammar schools\
        \ also should receive added benefits from the library, and accordingly in\
        \ the Autumn of 1S79 he invited the Superin tendent of Schools, a member of\
        \ the School Committee, and the Principal of the Normal School, to meet him\
        \ and discuss measures looking to an increased use of the books in the Public\
        \ Library by teachers and pupils of schools of the seventh, eighth and ninth\
        \ grades. It was obvious that the studies of the scholars could be made pleasanter\
        \ and more profitable by a free use of books, but the crowded state of the\
        \ course of study was an obstacle in the way of such a use of them. This obstacle\
        \ was overcome, however, and soou a good start was made in the work undertaken.\
        \ Special pupils' and teachers' cards, on which twelve and six books, respectively,\
        \ may be taken out of the library, are provided. The number of volumes given\
        \ out on these cards in 1880-1 was 7,501. During the library year 1SS5-6 the\
        \ number given out on such cards was 12,511. That is to say, writes Mr. Green,\
        \ \"if we reckon the school year as forty weeks of five days each, or as 200\
        \ days, and bear in mind the fact that all the books drawn out are kept fourteen\
        \ days, 875 volumes were in use, on the average, every day schools in Worcester\
        \ were in session during the last library year.\" Largely increased facilities\
        \ have just been afforded teachers and scholars in the grammar schools, and\
        \ it is believed that studies in them are being pursued with greater intelligence\
        \ and profit in consequence of the use of library books, than previously to\
        \ their employment. Several of the teachers are, practically speaking, almost\
        \ wholly controlling the general reading of their pupils outside of the school\
        \ houses and doing this without the exercise of force, by interesting boys\
        \ and girls in different subjects and then putting books into their hands\
        \ out of which they can get information respecting them. The Public Library\
        \ needs a new building and it is to be hoped that one will be immediately\
        \ provided.", 4]
    - ['WORCESTER: ITS PAST AND PRESENT. 104 In 1863 Mr. Dorman went to the West for
        a season to regain his health, and it was not expected that he would be able
        to manage a convention that autumn. Therefore Mr. J. D. Moore, who took a
        deep interest in musical matters, advertised a convention to be held in Mechanics
        Hall, to begin September 29th, under the musical direction of Mr. E. H. Frost,
        who had won many friends in Worcester. Mr. Dorman unexpectedly returned, and
        annnounced a convention to be held the same week at the City Hall. Here, then,
        were two conventions at the same time. The musical people of Worcester were
        greatly divided in sentiment, and there was a strong rivalry between the two
        factions. But Mr. Frost and his friends were too strong for their opponents,
        and the assembly at Mechanics Hall adopted the name of '' Worcester County
        Musical Convention,'' and organized October 2, 1863, with the following board
        of officers, nominated by a committee chosen for the purpose : President,
        Samuel E. Staples, Worcester ; Vice-Presidents, William Sumner, Worcester,
        B. K. DeLand, North Brook field, Moses G. Lyon, Fitchburg, A. C. Munroe, Worcester,
        J. H. Samson, Worcester ; Recording Secretary and Treasurer, William S. Denny,
        Worcester ; Corresponding Secretary and Librarian, J. D. Moore, Worcester.
        Also a board of thirty-six directors from various towns of Worcester County.
        At the time of its organization, no constitution was adopted : the number
        of active workers was very limited, and the number of persons upon whom an
        assessment could reasonably be levied to pay up any deficit in the running
        expenses, did not exceed a dozen; the secretary, who made the contracts with
        the artists, conductors and orchestras, being the only person legally bound
        by such contracts. There being a strong feeling that by some means a larger
        number of persons should be induced to assume and share in the burdens and
        responsibilities of carrying on so large an enterprise, a meeting of the board
        of officers was called at room No. 6 Mechanics Hall, at 10 o''clock a. m.,
        July n, 1866, to consider this and other matters concerning the festival (or
        convention, as it was then called). At this meeting, on motion of Mr. A. C.
        Munroe, a committee was appointed to " take in charge all matters pertaining
        to the next session, and to draft a constitu tion and by-laws for the organization."
        The committee, as nominated by the chair and unanimously elected, consisted
        of A. C. Munroe, William Sumner, William S. Denny, I. N. Metcalf and Seth
        Richards ; to these names were added, on motion of Mr. Munroe, Messrs. S.
        E. Staples and G W. Elkins, and on motion of Mr. Metcalf, the committee were
        authorized to fill vacancies, if any. At the next business meeting of the
        convention, held Thursday noon, October 25, 1866, the committee reported a
        draft of a constitution and by-laws, which draft was referred to a committee
        consisting of Messrs. Deland, Cheney, Livermore and Steams. At the adjourned
        meeting of the convention held in Mechanics Hall, 12 o''clock, Friday, October
        26, 1866, Mr. B. K. Deland from the committee on constitution, reported in
        their behalf the preamble, constitution and by-laws under which the operations
        of the association were carried on until their incor poration in 1879, the
        only change being that in 1871 the name of the organization was changed to
        the " Worcester County Musical Association," and its annual gatherings to
        be called festivals. In the by-laws thus established the attempt was made
        to induce a sense of personal responsibility on every one who attended, it
        being provided under article 2d, that " Gentlemen and ladies holding tickets
        to the annual session of the convention shall be considered as members of
        the convention for the current year, and shall be entitled to vote in all
        business meetings that may be held, and shall be further entitled to all privileges
        of the annual session." It was further provided, under Article 6th, that,
        "In case of any deficiency, the male members may be assessed in such manner
        as the convention may determine." As the necessity never arose for testing
        the strength of this provision for making up deficiencies, it is impossible
        to say how reliable a help it would have been found in time of adversity,
        the "Con vention " being a purely voluntary association. In the early days
        of the association it seemed an impossibility to second the attendance of
        any considerable number of persons at its business meetings, notwithstanding
        the articles quoted, and despite urgent invitations to be present. It was
        not until the association increased its surplus earnings to a considerable
        amount that attendance was increased at its business meetings to an average
        of more than fifteen persons. In the year 1876 the time seemed to have arrived
        when the interests of the association required that it should become incorporated
        under a state charter, and it was voted by the association that the executive
        board proceed to organize the association under the general laws, which was
        done by the board of government in April, 1879. The committee chosen for the
        purpose reported to the association, at the annual business meetings of 1877
        and 1878, the delay of the organiz ing being due to the urgent desire of the
        committee that the matter should be done in so careful and deliberate a manner
        as to fully meet the views of all those entitled in any manner to act thereon.
        A circumstance worthy of mention in this connection, as showing the desire
        of the public generally, while enjoying and supporting great enterprises to
        at the same time avoid active labor, or financial responsibility in their
        management,', 1]

        \ A. Stone and generous gifts from friends of the First Parish, secured the\

        Stephen Salisbury contributed three thousand dollars. The society has a valuable
        and well selected library, consisting of treaties upon subjects interesting
        to students of horticulture. The exhibitions of the society, every Thursday
        afternoon from March to November, have been eminently successful, and its

        Friend Society had its origin in the desire of a few benevolent ladies to
        save orphaned and friendless children from a life of vagrancy and crime. The
        charter was obtained April 5, 1849, and the society commenced without funds,
        relying wholly upon the charity of churches and individuals. A board of managers,
        composed of two ladies from each of the Protestant churches of the city, and
        a board of advisors, consisting of twelve prominent citizens, have the general
        manage ment of the institution. The executive control is vested in a first
        and second directress, secretary, treasurer, matron, and an assistant matron.
        In October, 1849, a building in the eastern part of the city was presented
        to the society by a benevolent citizen, and served as an Orphan Asylum for
        sixteen years. In 1865 this property was sold, and aided by CHILDREN''S FRIEND
        SOCIETY. donations and bequests the society was enabled to purchase the present
        estate on Main, corner of Benefit street. Since the founding of the institution,
        thirty-eight years ago, more than twelve hundred children have been cared
        for at the Home, and when old enough, a portion have found homes elsewhere,
        by adoption ; others have been received into families, where they have been
        educated to habits of self-reliance and usefulness, and many have found friends
        and obtained employment. An annual collection is taken in each of the religious
        societies for the support of the institution. The Masonic Societies embrace
        four lodges. " Morning Star Lodge " the oldest, was chartered in 1793. There
        are also two Royal Arch Chapters, one Council of Royal and Select Masters,
        one Commandery of Knight Templars, Lodge of Perfection, Council of Princes
        of Jerusalem, Chapters of Rose Croix, Eastern Star, and a Masonic Relief Association.
        Masonic Hall is located on Pearl street. The Odd Fellows date from 1844, when
        " Quinsigamond Lodge No. 43 " was organized. There are now five lodges of
        the Independent order, besides two Encampments, one Grand Canton, two lodges
        of Daughters of Rebekah, a Mutual Relief Association, and an Odd Fellows''
        Hall Association, with a fine building on Pleasant street. The Grand United
        Order of Odd Fellows have three lodges, a Grand Master''s Chapter, and a Household
        of Ruth. The TEMPERANCE Societies begin with the "Father Matthew," organized
        1849. Of a number of other organizations formed between 1845 and 1865, this

        \ was held, at which Hon. George F. Hoar presided, and resulted in the organization\
        \ of a society under the name of the \"Young Men's Library Association.\"\
        \ The object of the Society was stated in the constitution, subsequently adopted,\
        \ to be : \" the improvement of the young men of the city of Worcester, by\
        \ affording them intellectual and social advantages by the maintenance of\
        \ a library, reading-room, and such courses of lectures and classes as may\
        \ conduce to this end.\" An act of incorporation was obtained the following\
        \ year, and a subscription started for the purpose of raising money to found\
        \ a library. Some fourteen hundred dollars in cash was realized, and about\
        \ nine hundred volumes were given by public spirited citizens. A reading room\
        \ was also established in connection with the library, both of which were\
        \ freely consulted by the members. In April, 1854, several members who were\
        \ interested in natural history projected a plan for having such a department\
        \ in this Association. This plan was approved and an organization effected.\
        \ A collection of minerals, birds, shells and other specimens in natural history,\
        \ was transferred to its possession by members of an earlier society, then\
        \ defunct, as the nucleus of a cabinet. In 1856 the Young Men's Library Association\
        \ was united with the Worcester Lyceum, then one of the oldest societies in\
        \ the country \u2014 established for giving courses of popular lectures \u2014\
        \ and the name of the Society changed to that of the \" Lyceum and Library\
        \ Association.\" The library of the Lyceum, added to that already formed,\
        \ made about 3,800 volumes, available for use of the subscribers. The lectures\
        \ have been conducted with success not only proving useful and entertaining\
        \ to the public, but the source of great pecuniary benefit to the Association.\
        \ In 1856 Dr. John Green, then an eminent physician of Worcester, proposed\
        \ to place his private library in the charge of the Association, for a limited\
        \ time, and under certain restrictions. The number of volumes thus placed\
        \ at the disposal of members was over four thousand, and in addition to this\
        \ Dr. Green bore a large share of the expense incurred in arranging for their\
        \ reception. At the death of the librarian, in 1859, and the proposed formation\
        \ of a Free Public Library \u2014 to which Dr. Green was desirous of transferring\
        \ his own library \u2014 it was voted to transfer the library of the Association\
        \ to the city to form a nucleus of a circulating department. At this time\
        \ the library numbered 4,500 volumes. The attention of members was now called\
        \ more particularly to the department of natural history, which, for the first\
        \ time, became the main object of interest, together with the annual course\
        \ of lectures. In 1S66 the present name of the Associa tion was adopted as\
        \ more appropriate to the purposes of the Association. Meetings are held during\
        \ nine months of the year, papers read and discussions held of an entertaining\
        \ and instructive character, all of which, (as well as to inspect the cabinet)\
        \ the public are privileged to enjoy, with out charge, once each week. A Summer\
        \ School and Camp at Lake Quinsigamond has recently been established, and\

        the ground that "she wrote them all herself;" but its success must depend
        upon the amount of diligent research made by the compiler into the records

        the metropolis, who became habitues of the hostelry. Among them was William
        Hone, the antiquary and topographist. Another visitor was George Cruikshank,
        the artist, who, before his total abstinence days, had been Bohemian enough
        for his face to be well known at urban and suburban taverns, and to take part
        in the proceedings of a Vauxhall masquerade attired as a dustman. A more frequent
        visitor at the tavern was his brother Robert, in the early part of his life
        a seaman, but who became a pupil of his father, Isaac Cruikshank, and for
        the remainder of his days followed art as a profession. His illustrations
        to Pierce Egan''s Life in London gave him celebrity, and he was associated
        with Thomas Wageman and R. W. Buss in the illustration of Cumberland''s British
        and Minor Drama, a voluminous collection of plays edited by George Daniel.
        Among his confreres at the Gate House Tavern were George Daniel and William
        Upcott, the sub-librarian for many years of the London Institution, who had
        a store of personal anecdotes concerning its principal librarian, Richard
        Porson, the celebrated Greek scholar. Daniel and Upcott both resided for many
        years in Islington, and had tastes in common as biblio poles and print collectors.
        One of their Highgate cronies was John Grant, who in 1802 succeeded Nathaniel
        Norton as the Principal of the Old Crouch End School, Hornsey, a position
        which he held for more than forty years. Grant was a Scotch graduate, a capable
        schoolmaster, and the author of A Grammar of the English Language and of the
        Institutes of the Latin Language. He died in June 1846, and was buried in
        Hornsey Churchyard. Grant seldom missed spending his evening at the Gate House
        Tavern, and, as he grew old, used to ride on a donkey to and from his favourite
        resort. There are traditions that, when a very old man, the services of the
        animal were superseded on more than one occasion by the shoulders of a faithful
        friend who, finding that the donkey was disabled for the errand, volunteered
        to do duty for it, rather than that the infirm schoolmaster should be deprived
        of his nocturnal glass and gossip. "There were old-fashioned clubs, the ''Ash
        Sticks,'' the ''Aged Pilgrims,'' and the '' Ben Jonson,'' whose summer dinners
        used to be held here. Among their members were F. W. N. Bayley, Pierce Egan,
        Leman Rede, Bell of The Dispatch, Pearman the vocalist, Warren the water-colour
        artist, Thistleton the architect, Charles Whitehead, author of the novel Richard
        Savage, and Alexander Lee the musical com poser. In later times the coffee
        room was often the resort of Archibald Henning (who drew the first cartoon
        for Punch), and of Kenny Meadows, closely associated with the pictorial staff

        \ at No. 31 of Tom Hood in 1798. Old Jewry reminds us of the terrible history\
        \ of the Jews in England. The street derives its name from the common residence\
        \ therein of the Jews soon after the Conquest, William having brought over\
        \ with him a large number o( them. Here they abode until their expulsion from\
        \ the country by Edward I ; and when they, upon their readmission, selected\
        \ another quarter this was distinguished as Old Jewry. Prior to the reign\
        \ of Henry IL, it may be explained, they could bury their dead in only one\
        \ place, the plot of ground in Red Cross Street, therefore called the Jew's\
        \ Garden, on which Jewin Street now runs. The Church of St. Olave, here, which\
        \ is on the point of demolition, is architecturally uninteresting ; the interior\
        \ being a mere room with a low flat ceiling and a modillion cornice around\
        \ it, and the exterior having a short and ill-proportioned tower to which\
        \ the pinnacles at the angles do not add beauty. It was rebuilt by Wren in\
        \ 1676. Of the old edifice we have historic record in Diceto's survey made\
        \ in n8r. Against the north wall is a tablet, surmounted by a bust, to the\
        \ memory of John Boydell, Lord Mayor in 1790, whose services to English Art\
        \ can never be forgotten so long as a single copy survives of the superb edition\
        \ of Shakspeare produced by him at a prodigious cost, not to speak of the\
        \ noble Shakspeare Gallery which he formed in Pall Mall by employing such\
        \ artists as West, Reynolds and Northcote to paint pictures illustrative of\

        they meet with terrible privations, but from the entire disregard of all sanitary
        precautions the horrors of pestilence were more than frequent. Governor Bradford
        refers to a printed list of some eighteen Separatists dying of jail-fever
        in London between 1586 and 1592, and quotes from a petition of sixty of the
        survivors that they may not be "murdered" by "hunger and cold, and stifled
        in loathsome dungeons ; " he adds that many died from the hardships of their
        prisons.1 While Separatist men and women were freely thrown into such murderous
        imprisonment, but few of the Puritans were confined for their nonconformity;
        these few were mostly or entirely clergymen, whose prison life was made mild
        through the interest and wealth of their partisans, and was generally brief.
        The released Puritans were helped to congenial places as teachers, wardens,
        librarians, guardians, trustees, and pri vate chaplains, or to other positions
        controlled by their friends. Bradford says that the Puritans had another great
        advantage over the Separatists : the latter had not only " harder measure
        " from the same persecuting prelatists, but encountered the hostility and
        " sharp invectives " of the Puri tan preachers themselves (" the forward ministers"),
        who not only stirred up against them the people at home, but so prejudiced
        the Reformed clergy of other countries that while Puritan refugees found a
        cordial reception there, the Separa tists met with no favor. Thus the ejected
        Puritan clergy were mostly well cared for at home ; but the unfriended Separatists,
        deprived of a livelihood, were compelled to fly to other and uncongenial lands,
        or "else'' might have perished in prisons."2 1 George Johnson, a Cambridge
        " M.A.," and son of the Mayor of Rich mond (Yorkshire), was confined in London
        as a Separatist for six months in the most dark and unwholesome part of "
        The Clink." Sometimes for two days and nights he had no sustenance of any
        kind ; while for twenty days he had no bed ding but a straw mat, and no change
        of linen. His brother, the eminent preacher and scholar, was imprisoned at
        the same time. From 1660 to 16S8 there were recorded sixty thousand Nonconformists
        and Dissenters who were thrown into English prisons ; and of these more than
        five thousand died of privation and disease. 2 Bradford''s Dialogue ; Chron.
        PH., pp. 436-440. In the preface to the Dialogue Secretary Morton speaks of

        \ will be found reproduced in this work, for the polite librarian had great\
        \ pleasure in informing me that the Secretary of State for War had no objection\
        \ to my making copies thereof, and the gentleman in charge of the map department\
        \ was instructed to afford me the neces sary facilities for this purpose,\
        \ which he did most heartily and thoroughly. I fancied that the British Museum\
        \ people shared some of my joy at the breaking down of this ancient and useless\
        \ barrier. To me a new world was opened, and it was this fortunate discovery\
        \ which determined the idea I had long cherished of collating and publishing\
        \ \" The Records of the Woolwich District.\" To this effort, it is needless\
        \ to say, I have had to bring many other resources, the nature of which will\
        \ appear as the book proceeds. It may well be supposed that the labour has\
        \ not been light, but it has been deeply absorbing and pleasant, and it has\
        \ been amply repaid by many strange revelations, as well as by the generous\
        \ kindness and help which have met me at every step of my search. That I have\
        \ been enabled to procure so many pictorial illustrations, most of them now\
        \ printed for the first time, though the hands which drew them have been for\
        \ gene rations past at rest, is a fact sufficient to show that my exertions\
        \ have not been fruitless. These will not only elucidate the Records of Wool\
        \ wich, but in a surprising manner illuminate the past ages of Plumstead,\
        \ Charlton, Kidbrook, Shooters' Hill, and the whole district to which I have,\
        \ in more or less degree, as will hereafter appear, extended my inquisition.\
        \ How then to present them ? In the beginning of a task so compre hensive\

        \ an indefi nite period, like many others of the same kind, as a precaution\
        \ of national safety, lest some adversary might see and copy them to the prejudice\
        \ of Old England. To the principal librarian I pointed out that if they were\
        \ so antique, they would be more likely to mislead and injure an enemy than\
        \ assist him ; for the enemy would certainly fall into a trap if he expected\
        \ to find things as they were a hundred years ago. And the gentleman concurred\
        \ in my belief, but stated that the book was sealed by order of the Government,\
        \ and that without an order from the Government it would not be opened. Denials\
        \ whet desire, and I was now hankering feverishly for the forbidden fruit.\
        \ I wrote an argumentative letter to the librarian, formally applying for\
        \ permission to open the sealed packet, mentioning as references all the best\
        \ men I could think of, including one or two War Office and Admiralty people,\
        \ who could testify that I was neither a Russian nor a Soudanese. Then I handed\
        \ in the letter, returned the book with the seal intact, received my voucher,\
        \ and went home to wait. TNext day the postman brought me word from the librarian\
        \ that my application had been forwarded to the War Office, and for a whole\
        \ month the War Office was debating this momentous matter, until at last a\
        \ little friendly influence settled the point in my favour. An officer, who\
        \ was fortunately familiar with modern Woolwich, was sent to the British Museum,\
        \ and I had the extreme satisfaction of seeing the sealed packet ripped open\
        \ and its contents disclosed. The first sheet which I opened was \u2014 An\
        \ exact plan of the town of Woolwich, His Majesty's Dockyard and Ropewalk,\
        \ surveyed hy John Barker, with a plan of the Warren as surveyed in 1748,\
        \ and a view from Prince Rupert's Walk of the Royal Academy, Laboratory, &c,\
        \ surveyed and drawn by John Barker, 1749. This was a real prize. Every house\
        \ as it stood close upon a hundred and fifty years ago ! every garden-plot\
        \ laid out according to the fancy of the dead and forgotten occupier ; and\
        \ a thousand details for study, reflection, and deduction. But I hurried on,\
        \ and, after passing two or three more plans, I came upon \u2014 The North\

        part of 1791, he went to live at Dungannon, and through the interest of his
        friend Colonel Knox was placed in the commission of the peace for the county
        of Tyrone, and appointed to the situation of Seneschal of the Manor Court
        at Dungannon. This appoint ment he only held nine months, and then resigned
        it from conscientious feelings, having differed from his brother magistrates
        of the county respecting the mode of deciding questions between Catholics
        and Dissen ters, and having publicly stated on the bench that '' he could
        not reconcile it to his conscience to sit as magistrate on a bench where the
        practice prevailed of inquiring what a man''s religion was before inquiring
        into the crime with which a prisoner was accused.'' These words ought to be
        inscribed on Russell''s tomb. At that period there were also differences between
        the linen merchants and the weavers, and Russell''s sympathies with the latter
        caused him to be looked on with suspicion as a man with dangerous leanings
        towards the people, in fact a Republican. After throwing up his appointment
        he returned to Belfast, and, being without resource or employment, was dependent
        solely on the kindness and liberality of Dr. M''Donnell, in whose house he
        lived for a con siderable time. The situation was then obtained for him of
        librarian to the Belfast Library, and it was while holding this appointment
        that the idea was suggested by him of founding the Belfast Academical Institution.',

    - ['John D. Fox. 121 JOHN D. FOX Was born in the village of Harden, near Bingley,
        on Feb. 25th, 1849. During the first 12 years of his life he resided with
        his grandparents and pleasant indeed are bis recollections of those days.
        He then along with his guardians, and a crippled girl who had found shelter
        under the same roof, removed to Bingley. Shortly after this the elder people
        died, and the subject of this sketch felt as he had not realized before that
        life had its cares and hardships, that he must do something for the support
        of himself. He found work at Victoria Mills at a small weekly wage, but having
        an aspiring nature was constantly on the look out for opportunities of self
        improvement ; with a view to this he regularly attended the evening classes
        at the Mechanics'' Institute. When about 21 years of age, the position of
        Secretary and Librarian of Bingley Mechanics'' Institute becoming vacant,
        he applied for the appointment and secured it. This situation he held for
        13 years, and here he wrote many of his poems. During his position at the
        Institute he married Maria, the youngest daughter of the late Jonas and Martha
        Cculton.of Harden Beck. Family cares and responsibilities increasing he ventured
        on another step, leaving the Institute for the post of Organising Agent for
        a local Insurance Co. This appointment did not turn out as expected through
        circumstances over which he had no control, hence he decided on another change.
        He began and is now engaged in a business of his own making, as a Wholesale
        Dealer in specialities in Drugs. As he is succeeding equal to his most sanguine
        expectations he is likely to continue in this line. Mr. Fox is closely associated
        with the various social, philanthropic and religious movements of the town
        of Bingley. He is a member of the Primitive Methodist Church, President of
        the Christian Association of this Church, a trustee for several chapels, Sunday
        School Superintendent, and a most acceptable Local Preacher. Respecting his
        literary tastes and abilities, much might be said. Some years ago he published
        a little work, entitled " The Preacher''s Register," which elicited favourable
        notices from Archdeacon Farrar, Paxton Hood, Bishop Simpson, Dr. Punshon,
        Dr. Antliff, <fec. Recently he wrote a story entitled " The Struggles of a',

        expect from his friendship for me, that he would use all his influence with
        the Pope (they spend many of their evenings together), to divert him from
        his purpose. In fact, I cannot bear the idea of expatriating myself, much
        less of shackling myself with all the state and formality of the Roman court."
        The progress of the history had not entirely ab sorbed the attention of Dr.
        Lingard. On his return from Rome, in October, 1825, his learning was dis played
        in two powerful articles inserted in the " British Critic ; " one on the works
        of Joannes Corippus, the other on an Armenian version of Eusebius, which had
        been brought by his friend, Mr. Brown, from the Arme nian convent at Venice.
        In the following June, the ferocious attack levelled at him by Mr. Allen,
        in the " Edinburgh Review," called his mind in another direction, and afforded
        him an opportunity of reply ing to the charges of the various assailants of
        his history. Some time during the October of 1825, Dr. Lingard, through the
        agency and at the request of Mawman, had inserted in the " British Press "
        news paper an article on the authenticity of a MS. in the king''s library
        at Paris. It was written anonymously; but the writer had incautiously spoken
        of an inter view between himself and Mons. Buchon, the king''s librarian,
        on the subject of this MS. ; and Mawman, unfortunately, in conveying it to
        the "Press" for pub lication, had, unknown to Lingard, added to it a passage
        which reflected in some manner upon Allen. The latter saw the passage ; and,
        availing himself of the clue afforded by the mention of M. Buchon, made application
        to that gentleman ; ascertained that Lin gard was the person who had examined

  - 000839767
  - - ['PREFACE. In this volume I have attempted to trace the history of some of the
        ancient houses and notable places within the limits of " Ould Newbury," and
        have also endeavored to embody in brief biographical sketches some of the
        facts and incidents connected with the mercantile, literary, and political
        life of the town. I have been compelled to leave unnoticed many buildings
        and places of historic interest, and have found it impossible to sketch, even
        briefly, the work and influence of the distinguished men and women of Newbury
        birth and parentage who are run,'' living in this community, or elsewhere,
        without very materially increasing the size of this volume, which is already
        too large for convenient use. I trust, however, that a more comprehensive
        work, giving the history of Newbury, Newburyport, and West Newbury from their
        incorporation down to the present time, will soon be undertaken by some competent
        and careful writer, who will collect and preserve for future generations the
        names of the men that are necessarily excluded from these pages, with a full
        and detailed account of the important events in which they have participated.
        The facts and incidents contained in these sketches have been gathered from
        every available source ; but my thanks are especially due to Sidney Perley,
        Esq., of Salem, Mass., and to John Ward Dean, A. M., librarian of the New
        Eng land Historic-Genealogical Society of Boston, for valuable advice and
        assistance in preparing them for the press. I desire also to acknowledge my
        indebtedness to Abner C. Goodell. Jr., commissioner for the publication of
        the Acts and Resolves of the Province of Massachusetts Bay ; to Walter K.
        Watkins, secretary of the Massachusetts Society', 1]

        of the "Narra tive and Critical History of America," edited by Justin Winsor,
        Librarian of Harvard University, there is a photo graphic copy of a map of
        the New England coast from Cohasset, on the southeasterly side of Boston,
        to the mouth of the Merrimack River. The original map, from which it was taken,
        was discovered in 1884 among the Sloane manuscripts in the British Museum
        by Mr. Henry F. Waters, of Salem, Mass. It was made as early, probably, as
        1634 ; and the notes in the margin giving the location of Governor''s Island
        and other prominent places are, undoubted])-, in the handwriting of Governor
        Winthrop. Only a few of the rivers and towns are designated by name ; but
        the Merrimack is distinctly marked as navigable to a point now known as Mitchell''s
        Falls, and is also quite accurately described in these words: "It runns 100
        miles up into the Country, and falles out of a ponde 10 miles broad." A long,
        narrow island at the mouth of the river can easily be identified as Plum Island,
        but has no name on the map. The village of Aga wam (Ipswich) is connected
        by dotted lines with Sagus (Saugus), Salem, and Meads ord (Medford), showing
        that at this early date the line of travel between these places was substantially
        the same as now. The old road from Newbury to Boston still follows, very nearly,
        the narrow path that was once, probably, only an Indian trail through the
        forest. It is interesting; to note the long, circuitous route taken to avoid
        crossing broad rivers ; for bridge building was difficult and expensive in
        those early days. Where the depth of water rendered streams impassable, ferries
        were established ; but shallow brooks and rivers were', 1]

        \ and comprehending an endless variety of subjects. To Dr. T. W. Thursfield,\
        \ who has filled the office of chairman for seventeen years, and who has been\
        \ unceasing in his efforts to improve the institution, warm and lasting thanks\
        \ are owing.* Mr. D. B. Grant, the Librarian for the past thirty-six years,\
        \ in the discharge of his duties has won the esteem of the Committee and all\
        \ the frequenters of the Library. This forward movement into the domain of\
        \ knowledge and mental recreation was immediately followed by another in which\
        \ the public health and convenience were deeply concerned. From 1856 to 1859,\
        \ the then officially beardless Board of Health were engaged in negotiations\
        \ having for their object the improvement of the drainage and the prevention\
        \ of floods, to which at that time Leamington was peculiarly liable. In the\
        \ last-named year, Mr. A. S. Field, legal adviser to the Board, and Messrs.\
        \ A. Alexander and Joseph Stanley, after encountering many difficulties, arranged\
        \ terms with the land owners having interests in the land adjacent to the\
        \ river, and at a cost of \xA3\"20,000 the Leam from the Victoria Bridge to\
        \ its confluence with the Avon was widened, straightened, and cleansed, an\
        \ enlarged and efficient drainage system being at the same time introduced.\
        \ As indispensable parts of this work, the Board paid to Lord Warwick \xA3\
        \"2,676 for the right to remove the old mill and weir near the Manor House,\
        \ Edmonscote, and to Mr. Matthew Wise \xA32,075 for the land now forming the\
        \ beautiful New River Walk and the site of the Pumping Station. In the sixties,\
        \ the Board, in common with many other local authorities, were confronted\
        \ with the great sewage problem. There were two methods then before the country\
        \ of dealing with sewage \u2014 precipitation and irrigation. They chose the\
        \ former, but the result was not satisfactory, and in consequence of the effluent\
        \ water from the works fouling the Avon, the late Mr. Thomas Heath applied\
        \ to Chancery for an injunction, Mr. Hitchman's sage advice, \"the sewage\
        \ to the land and the rainfall to the river,\" was unheeded, and in 1868 the\
        \ Court of Chancery sequestrated the town property in consequence of the contumacy\
        \ of the Board in regard to prohibitory orders issued ; inhibited Mr. Summerfield,\
        \ of Lloyds Bank, the treasurer, from paying any of the Board's cheques, and\
        \ left the Board stranded high and dry, deprived of every shred of authority.\
        \ At this juncture, Mr. H. C. Passman succeeded in the clerkship Mr. R. A.\
        \ Wallington, who had resigned, and his first principal duty was to obtain\
        \ a relaxation of the Sequestration Order. In this he was successful, and\
        \ the new policy of irrigation having superseded the former scheme of deodorisation,\
        \ satisfactory arrangements were concluded with Lord Warwick * There are several\
        \ names indissolubly associated with the Library by long or special service\
        \ In the early years of its history, the Rev. J. Hamilton Davies and Mr. J.\
        \ Hugh Hawley were successful in raising the general standard of its merit\
        \ by gradually introducing works greatly in advance of the original selections\
        \ The Reference Library, with its thousands of literary treasures, a priceless\
        \ boon to Leamington, is principally thc fruit of many years' unremitting\
        \ toil by Alderman Dr. Thursfield. Alderman S. Flavel, as the hon. treasurer\
        \ to the first School of Art, carried on in connection with the Free Library,\
        \ materially assisted in preparing the way for the Technical Education movement\
        \ of thc present time, and the establishment of a separate department for\
        \ musical works, a most valuable addition to the attractions of the Institution,\
        \ was brought about entirely by the exertions of Councillor Overt 11.", 1]

        \ that he was playing the fool like any stupid young man. ' That's a favourite\

        to the adoption of the Abel system of testing, and particulars are added of
        the modifications which have been made in the original form of the instrument
        employed. I have to thank Professor Dr. C. Engler, of Karlsruhe, for a personal
        communi cation descriptive of the method of fractional distillation which
        he is accustomed to adopt, and Professor Dewar, F.R.S., for various suggestions.
        My brother, Mr. Robert Redwood, has done me the service of reading the proofs
        of this section and the previous one. Some difficulty has been experienced
        in dealing adequately with the Uses of Petroleum and its Products (Section
        X.) within the space available, and this will be readily understood when it
        is borne in mind that in this portion of the work it was necessary to describe
        not only the ordinary uses of mineral burning oils, mineral lubricating oils,
        paraffin, vaseline, &c, but also the important applications of some of the
        products in the manu facture of gas, as liquid fuel, and as a source of power
        (in petroleum motors). As a section of such a work, the information given
        will, I believe, be found sufficiently full, and the references appended indicate
        the sources of further details. The last Section (XI.) is devoted to Statutory
        and other Regulations relating to the Testing, Storage, Transport, and Use
        of Petroleum and its Products. The material for this section has been principally
        collected by Mr. Charles Salter, who has ably discharged a somewhat laborious
        task. Information has been furnished for this portion of the work by Mr. H.
        J. Chancy, of the Standards Department of the Board of Trade ; Mr. James H.
        Gough, Secretary to the Conservators of the River Thames ; Mr. Alfred Spencer,

        \ in Toronto. Numberless were the appointments made to meet him ; he was always\
        \ on the spot at the appoint ed hour, but never did he meet the parties by\
        \ whose appointment he had come. Excuses the most frivolous were assigned\
        \ as the cause of the disappointment, and another meeting would be arranged,\
        \ only again to be disregarded. Though weary and disgusted by such conduct,\
        \ he restrained his indignation, and strove to extend his charitable feelings\
        \ to the last point of leniency. It is probable too, that, with his views\
        \ of honor and dignity, he found it difficult to attribute the treatment he\
        \ received to deliberate wantonness. But humiliating as was the conclu sion,\
        \ he was compelled to acknowledge to himself that he was being deliberately\
        \ imposed upon, and that they had no idea of listening to a recital of his\
        \ wrongs, much less of redressing them. We can readily imagine, therefore,\
        \ with what bitterness of feeling he turned his back on Toronto and returned\
        \ home. While on his way thither, he met an old friend at an hotel, to whom\
        \ he detailed the story of his experience, and then taking a large bundle\
        \ of papers which related to the matter which had called him to the Capital,\
        \ he threw them into the fire, and vowed that he would no longer live under\
        \ a Government so despotic. Time, however, the great pacificator, healed in\
        \ a great measure his wounded spirit, and he spent his last days in the place\
        \ where he had seen so much trouble, and lived, too, to see his son a respected\
        \ and influential subject of the Canadian Government. Of his other children,\
        \ who were all very intelligent, and possessed marked individuality of character,\
        \ Ann Maria (Mrs. L. H. Redfield) was a woman of remark able ability, and\
        \ distinguished for her knowledge of natural science. Her text-book, \"Zoological\

        \ like many other young men of that section, he espoused the cause of his\

        \ to Quebec the ill-starred Richard Montgomery. After the close of that disastrous\
        \ affair, Johnson became acquainted with and married a Miss Abbott, the daughter\
        \ of a captain in the British service. He lived for a time in New Hampshire,\
        \ and then moved to Canada and settled in Hawkesbury, but not many years subsequently\
        \ he broke through the ice on the Ottawa while chasing a deer, and was drowned.\

        room, Watty was in his element. He was one of those men in whom the love for
        books seems to be inborn and natural. To such, the very fingering of books
        is a pleasure. They fondle them as they were living things, until they know
        every one by hand, and could go in the dark and pick out what volume they
        please. Watty ought to have been a librarian ; and here piled up on the floor
        was the largest library he had ever been privileged to explore. One side of
        the room had been already fitted up with shelving, and now it would be a labour
        of love with Watty, if only Mr. Urquhart would allow him, to fill the shelves
        with the books arranged', 1]

        \ On the third of October 1618 Francesco Calderini went to complain to his\
        \ father-in-law Claudio Usimbardi about the ill conduct of his wife. Usim\
        \ bardi getting angry stabbed his son-in-law, and having killed him, ran away\

        \ went to take the corpse to the family vault in Santa Croce. Wkde on their\
        \ way, it began to rain so hard that one of the friars carrying the coffin\

        \ into the drain then existing under the fountain and until the day after\
        \ it was not possible to take it out. Meanwhile the storm growing worse and\
        \ worse, the Dominican friars were obliged to spend the night in the monastery\
        \ of the Fran ciscans in Santa Croce. This fact, connected with the fete of\
        \ Saint Francis which occurred on that same day, gave origin to the custom\
        \ of the Dominicans of Santa Maria Novella to go on the fourth of October\
        \ to dine at Santa^ Croce, while the Franciscans dined at Santa Maria Novella\
        \ on Saint Dominic 's fete day. This custom lasted until the monasteries were\

        \ where Luca Pitti lived before building the great palace, at present the\
        \ residence of the Royal family (\xA7 655). From this house, Garibaldi addressed\

        \ closed red books with gold nails on a silver ground - was first owned by\
        \ one Matteo Libri, whose profession was to copy MSS and codes. Among the\

        \ (-[- 1665), one of the most learned members of the Academies of the Crusca\
        \ and of the Apatisti. The house at the corner between Via del Sole and Via\

        epithet of Martel, the Hammer, which has been added to the name of Charles,
        is expressive of his weighty and irresistible strokes : the valour of Eudes
        was excited by resentment and emulation ; and their companions, in the eye
        of history, are the true Peers and Paladins of French chivalry. After a bloody
        field, in which Abderame was slain, the Saracens, in the close of the evening,
        retired to their camp. In the disorder and despair of the night, the various
        tribes of Yemen and Damascus, of Africa and Spain, were provoked to turn their
        arms against each other : the remains of their host was suddenly dissolved,
        and each emir con sulted his safety by an hasty and separate retreat. At the
        dawn of day, the stillness of an hostile camp was suspected by the victorious
        Christians : on the report of their spies, they ventured to explore the riches
        of the vacant tents ; but, if we except some celebrated relics, a small portion
        of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful owners. The joyful tidings
        were soon dif fused over the Catholic world, and the monks of Italy could
        affirm and believe that three hundred and fifty, or three hundred and seventy-five,
        thousandof the Mahometans had been crushed by the hammer of Charles ; 37 while
        no more than fifteen hundred Chris tians were slain in the field of Tours.
        But this incredible tale is sufficiently disproved by the caution of the French
        general, who apprehended the snares and accidents of a pursuit, and dismissed
        his German allies to their native forests. The inactivity of a conqueror betrays
        the loss of strength and blood, and the most cruel execution is inflicted,
        not in the ranks of battle, but on the backs of a flying enemy. Yet the victory
        of the Franks was They retreat complete and final ; Aquitain was recovered
        by the arms of Frank* Eudes ; the Arabs never resumed the conquest of Gaul,3S
        and they were soon driven beyond the Pyrenees by Charles Martel 37 These numbers
        are stated by Paul Warnefrid, the deacon of Aquileia (de Gestis Langobard.
        1. vi. p. 921, edit. Grot. [c. 46]), and Anastasius, the librarian of the
        Roman church (in Vit. Gregorii II.), who tells a miraculous story of three
        consecrated spunges, which rendered invulnerable the French soldiers among
        whom they had been shared. It should seem that in his letters to the pope
        Eudes usurped the honour of the victory, for which he is chastised by the
        French annalists, who, with equal falsehood, accuse him of inviting the Saracens.
        38 [This is not quite accurate. Maurontius, the duke of Marseilles, preferred
        the alliance of the misbelievers to that of the Frank warrior, and handed
        over Aries, Avignon, and other towns to the lords of Narbonne, who also obtained
        possession of Lyons and Valence. They were smitten back to Narbonne by Charles
        the Hammer in A.D. 737, and yet again in 739. Cp. Weil, op. cit. p. 647. Okba

        (1860) is still con venient. Excellent French translation by L. Leger, Chronique
        dite de Nestor, 1884, with an index 19 which is half a commentary.] Latin
        and other Western Sources Amatus of Salerno, monk of Monte Cassino and bishop
        of an unknown see, wrote about a.d. 1080 a history of the Norman conquest
        of southern Italy, taking as a model the Historia Langobardorum of Paul the
        Deacon. We do not possess the work in its original shape, but only in a faulty
        French translation, made per haps c. 1300 a.d., which has survived in a single
        Ms. It was edited for the first time, and not well, by Champollion-Figeac
        in 1835 (L''Ystoire de li Normant et la Chronique de Robert Viscart, par Aime,
        moine de Mont-C''assin), but has been recently edited by O. Delarc, 1892.
        The work is divided into 8 Books, and em braces the history of the Normans
        from their first appearance in Italy to a.d. 1078. "It is," says Giesebrecht,
        "no dry monosyllabic annalistic account, but a full narrative of the conquest
        with most attractive details, told with charming naivete. Yet Amatus does
        not overlook the significance of the events which he relates, in their ecumenical
        context. His view grasps the contemporary Norman conquest of England, the
        valiant feats of the French knights against the Saracens of Spain, and the
        influence of Norman mercenaries in the Byzantine empire. In beginning his
        work (which he dedicates to the Abbot Desiderius, Robert Guis card''s intimate
        friend) he is conscious that a red thread rims through all these undertakings
        of the knight-errants and that God has some special purpose in His dealings
        with this victorious race." [For criticism of the work, the most im portant
        study is that of F. Hirsch in Forschungen zur deutsehen Geschichte, 8, p.
        205 sqq. (1868).] Amatus was unknown to Gibbon, but he was a source of the
        most important works which Gibbon used. He was one of the sources of the poem
        of William of Apulia (begun c. a.d. 1099, finished by a.d. 1111), who also
        utilised the Annals of Bari. Now that we have Amatus (as well as the Annals
        of Bari) the value of William lies in the circumstance that he used also a
        lost biography of Robert Guiscard. [New ed. by Wilmans, in Pertz, Mon. ix.
        p. 239 sqq.] Amatus was also a source of Geoffrey Malaterra, who wrote the
        history of the Normans in Sicily (up to 1099) at the instance of Count Roger
        (see above, Gibbon''s notes in chap. lvi.). [For the relation of this to the
        Anonymi Vaticani Historia Sicula, see A. Heskel, Die Hist. Sic. des Anon.
        Vat. und des Gaufredus Malaterra, 1891.] Leo, monk and librarian of Monte
        Cassino, afterwards Cardinal-bishop of Ostia (died 1115), wrote a chronicle
        of his monastery, which he carried down to a.d. 1075. It is a laudable work,
        for which ample material (discreetly used by Leo) lay in the library of the
        monastery. [Ed. by Wattenbach in Pertz, Mon. vii. p. 574 sqq. Cp. Balzani,
        Le cronache Italiane nel medio evo, p. 150 sqq. (1884).] The work was continued
        (c. 1140) by the Deacon Peter, who belonged to the family of the Counts of
        Tusculum, as far as the year 1137- [Ed. Watten bach, ib. p. 727 sqq.] Other
        sources (Annales Barenses, Chron. breve Nortmannicum, &c.) are mentioned in
        the notes of chap. lvi. It should be observed that there is no good authority
        for the name "Lupus protospatharius," under which name one of the Bari chronicles
        is always cited. Contemporary Beneventane annals are preserved in (1) Annales
        Beneventani, in Pertz, Mon. iii. p. 173 sqq. and (2) the incomplete Chronicon
        of the Beneventane Falco (in Del Re''s Cronisti, vol. i. p. 161 sqq.); both
        of which up to 1112 have a common origin. Cp. Giesebrecht, Gesch. der deutsehen

        \ God is one in whom there is a Divine Trinity, and that he is the Lord God\
        \ and Saviour Jesus Christ. 2. That a saving faith is to believe on him. 3.\
        \ That evil actions ought not to be done, because they are of the devil and\
        \ from the devil. 4. That good actions ought to be done because they are of\
        \ God and from God. 5. That a man should do them as of himself; nevertheless\
        \ under this belief that they are for the Lord operating wilh him and by him.\
        \ They hold, too, that certain portions of the Bible are written in a peculiar\
        \ manner; that they contain an internal spiritual sense, which is opened to\
        \ those only who are in the love of Truth; that while the letter of the Divine\
        \ Word deals with past or future events the spiritual sense deals with an\
        \ eternal now. Thus the 1st chapter of Genesis illustrates the progressive\
        \ stages of regeneration. Their place of meeting is in a small house, No.\

        \ a very handsome building in Wretham Road. The minister is the Rev. R. R.\
        \ Rodgers. In connection with the Church is an extensive library, free to\
        \ visitors. In the Smethwick Free Library there are about 60 volumes of works\

        \ the truth of Spiritualism. The first public effort was made on August 14th,\

        \ 160 persons was opened. Successful meetings are held there every Sunday,\
        \ very often the Hall being uncomfortably crowded. Earnest enquirers are always\

        \ of the fall of stones from the sky were then treated as absurd, and the\
        \ exhibition of such stones in a public museum would have been a matter for\
        \ ridicule ; a few stones, which had escaped destruction, were scattered about\
        \ Europe, and were in the possession of private individuals curious enough\
        \ to preserve bodies concerning the fall of which upon our globe such reports\
        \ had been given. Hence it happened that in 1807 probably not more than four\
        \ or five meteoric stones were in the British Museum ; one of them was a stone\
        \ of the L'Aigle fall, presented in 1804 by Biot, the distinguished physicist.\

        which is before us. Except in one or two instances, I have judged it advisable,
        for the sake of clearness, to modernize the spelling of documents quoted in
        the text. In the notes they are usually given in their original form. I have
        to acknowledge my indebtedness in many particulars to Mr. H. W. Brewer, who
        not only con tributes valuable sketches to illustrate the narrative, but has
        furnished many important notes and sugges tions, based upon his exhaustive
        knowledge of ancient London. I have to thank the Marquis of Salisbury for
        permission to examine MSS. .in the Hatfield collection, and his lordship''s
        librarian, Mr. Gunton, for information supplied from the same source. Through
        the courtesy of the Deputy-Keeper of the Public Records, every facility has
        been afforded me for con sulting the precious documents contained in the "
        Gun powder Plot Book." The Dean of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, has kindly
        given me access to an important MS. in the College Library ; and I have been
        allowed by the Rector of Stonyhurst to retain in my hands Father Greenway''s
        MS. history of the Plot during the whole period of my work. The proprietors

        of the University, contain a magnificent library, magnificently lodged. The
        central passage has a vista of over two hundred yards in length, through a
        series of rooms devoted to the various branches of litera ture. The lower
        half of the walls is occupied by books, while the upper portion is entirely
        covered by the armorial blazons of the most distinguished students of the
        University, which in past centuries was one of the most renowned in Europe.
        Every nation has its representatives among these blazonments that enrich the
        walls, and the librarian pointed out several bearing the superscription ''
        Anglorum.'' Here, where once he was librarian, we saw the bust of that unrivalled
        possessor of the gift of tongues, Mezzofanti, who spoke forty-two languages.
        He was the son of a carpenter in Bologna, and rose ultimately to the dignity
        of a Cardinal. He died in 1849, at the age of seventy-three. Lord Byron once
        met him, and declared that he would have been invaluable at the Tower of Babel
        as universal interpreter. '' I tried him,'' he says, ''in all the tongues

        \ communion with the usurper, still presumed to hold their pious, but illegal,\

        \ the sense. Mr. Hodgkin observes that, next to Rhetoric, \"Natural History\
        \ had the highest place in his affections. He never misses an opportunity\
        \ of pointing a moral lesson by an allusion to the animal creation, especially\
        \ to the habits of birds.\" A short extract found in a Ms. of the Institutiones\

        \ Holderi, was edited with a commentary by H. Usener in 1877- It threw new\
        \ light on some points connected with the statesman's biography. The Variae\
        \ have been edited in a splendid edition by Mommsen (in Mon. Germ. Hist.,\
        \ 1894). A large volume of selected translations has been published by Mr.\
        \ Hodgkin. The Chronicle (or Consularia) of Cassiodorus was drawn up in a.d.\
        \ 519, on the occasion of the consulship of Theodoric' s son-in-law, Eutharic\
        \ Cillica. The sources which he used were : (1) The Chronicle of Jerome ;\
        \ (2) the Chronicle of Prosper, in the edition published in a.d. 445 (cp.\
        \ above, vol. iii., Appendix 1), for the years subsequent to the end of Jerome's\
        \ Chron. ; (3) an epitome of Livy ; (4) the history of Aufidius Bassus ; (5)\
        \ Eutropius ; (6) the Paschale of Victorius ; (7) Consularia Italica (see\
        \ above, vol. iii., App. 1). \"\"Written for the use of the city populace,\"\
        \ as Mommsen remarks, it contains many entries relating to games and the buildings\
        \ in Rome, and it is marked by some interesting blunders in grammatical form.\
        \ Finding in his source, for instance, Varane et Tcrtullo conss. {a.d. 410),\
        \ Cassiodorus translating this into the nominative case gives Varan et Tertullus.\
        \ See Mommsen, Chron. Min. ii., p. 112. In the later part of the work he has\
        \ made several slight additions and changes of his own in the notices which\
        \ he copies from his authorities, out of regard for Gothic feelings. Thus\
        \ Prosper recorded that Ambrose of Milan wrote \" in defence of the Catholic\
        \ faith \". But the Goths were Arians ; and so Cassiodorus modifies the phrase\
        \ to \"concerning the Christian faith\". Again Prosper simply states that\
        \ \"Rome was taken by the Goths under Alaric '' ; Cassiodorus adds that \"\
        they used their victory with clemency\". The best edition is Mommsen's in\
        \ Chron. Min. ii., p. 120 sejq. Flavius Cresconius Corippus, a native of Africa,\
        \ seems to have held the office of a tribune or a notary, in that branch of\
        \ the civil service of which the quaestor of the Sacred Palace was the chief\
        \ .;;y He was an old man at the death of Jus tinian. :i1 He wrote two poems\
        \ relating to contemporary history, both of the greatest interest and importance.\
        \ (1) The Johannid celebrates the Moorish wars of Johannes, who was- appointed\
        \ Magister Militum in a.d. 54G (see below, Appendix 18). It was unknown to\
        \ Gibbon and was published for the first time by Mazzucchelli (librarian of\
        \ the Ambrosian library) from the Codex Trivultianus, the only Ms. now known\
        \ to exist. (Other Mss. known in the Middle Ages and as late as the sixteenth\
        \ century have disappeared. ) The poem contains eight Books ; the end of the\
        \ eighth Book is missing, and there are other lacunae. :l2 Corippus intro\
        \ duces a sketch of the events in Africa which preceded the arrival of John\
        \ (3, 54-4, 246); describing the career of Antala, the wars of Solomon and\
        \ Areobindus. The poem must have been composed soon after the decisive victory\
        \ of John in a.d. 548. The respect shown for Athanasius, the pr\xE6torian\
        \ prefect, suggests that he was still in office when Corippus wrote. (2) Towards\

    - ["OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 113 While Sigismond embraced the corpse of the unfortunate\
        \ youth, he received a severe admonition from one of his attendants: \"It\
        \ is not his situation, O king ! it is thine which deserves pity and lamentation\
        \ \". The reproaches of a guilty conscience were alleviated, however, by his\
        \ liberal donations to the monastery of Agaunum, or St. Maurice, in Vallais\
        \ ; which he himself had founded in honour of the imaginary martyrs of the\
        \ Theb\xE6an legion.49 A full chorus of perpetual psalmody was instituted\
        \ by the pious king ; he assiduously practised the austere devotion of the\
        \ monks ; and it was his humble prayer that heaven would inflict in this world\
        \ the punishment of his sins. His prayer was heard ; the avengers were at\
        \ hand ; and the provinces of Burgundy were overwhelmed by an army of victorious\
        \ Franks. After the event of an unsuccessful battle, Sigismond, who wished\
        \ to protract his life that he might prolong his penance, concealed himself\
        \ in the desert in a religious habit, till he was discovered and betrayed\
        \ by his subjects, who solicited the favour of their new masters. The captive\
        \ monarch, with his wife and two children, were transported to Orleans, and\
        \ buried alive in a deep well, by the stern command of the sons of Clovis\
        \ ; whose cruelty might derive some excuse from the maxims and examples of\
        \ their barbarous age. Their ambition, which urged them to achieve the conquest\
        \ of Burgundy, was inflamed, or disguised, by filial piety ; and Clotilda,\
        \ whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of injuries, pressed them\
        \ to revenge her father's death on the family of his assassin. The rebellious\
        \ Burgundians, for they attempted to break their chains, were still permitted\
        \ to enjoy their national laws under the obligation of tribute and military\
        \ service ; and the Merovingian princes peaceably reigned over a kingdom whose\
        \ glory and greatness had been first over thrown by the arms of Clovis.60\

        to the same century. In the same depository are the Reports of the Royal Historical
        Manuscripts Commission, and the Calendar of Virginia State Papers, the earlier
        volumes of which, edited with great care and learning by Dr. William P. Palmer,
        throw the most important light on the Colo nial Age. Mr. Alexander Brown''s
        noble collection of private and public documents in his Genesis of the United
        States, a collection which will always be a monu ment to his patience, industry,
        and scholarship ; the Works of Captain John Smith as edited by Professor Arber
        ; and the Abstracts of Proceedings of the Virginia Company of London,1 published
        by the Virginia Histor ical Society, have furnished me invaluable information
        in the investigation of the condition of the people in the first decades of
        the century. Largely owing to the scholarly care of Mr. Charles Poindexter,
        late State Librarian, the collection of tracts bearing upon the history of
        Virginia throughout that whole period, now in the State Library at Richmond,
        is one of the most complete to be found in this country, and upon this collection
        I have xlrawn to very great advantage. A complete list of all the authorities
        used in the preparation of this work, with the special edi tions consulted,
        will be found appended. An exhaustive chronological history of Virginia in
        the Colonial Age has never been written, and this is also true 1 These Abstracts
        were prepared by the late Conway Robinson, Esq., from Vols. I and II of the
        Randolph MSS., now in possession of the Virginia Historical Society.', 1]
    - ['31 REASONS FOR THE COLONIZATION OF VIRGINIA prompted him to exaggerate the
        prevalence among the Indians of the report that the South Sea was situated
        not far from Jamestown; that is to say, he desired not only to pass over in
        silence all that was calculated to injure the prospects of the Colony in the
        English mind, but also to bring out in the broadest light every fact that
        would increase public interest in the Virginian enterprise. The interviews
        with Opechancanough and Powhatan, recorded in the Neives from Virginia, recall
        very forcibly the in formation which Ralph Lane obtained from the Indians
        Captain John Smith and his Critics, by Mr. Charles Poindexter, late librarian
        of the State Library of Virginia, in which strong evidence is advanced to
        show that the Newes from Virginia is in a garbled form in its present shape.
        The conclusions reached by Professor Edward Arber, the English editor of Smith''s
        works, should carry great weight as being those of a man entirely free from
        the sectional feeling which has colored the attacks upon, as well as the defence
        of, Captain Smith on this side of the Atlantic. His point of view was impartial
        and disinterested. " Pos terity will see in Smith," he wrote in the introduction
        to his edition, " a noble example of what a Christian Gentleman and Officer
        may be, may do, and may endure." The introduction, ,as far as made up by contribu
        tions from Professor Arber'' s pen, is a most striking tribute to the charac
        ter and services of Captain Smith in his career in Virginia. It has been the
        curious fate of this remarkable man to be pursued, after death, by an animosity
        as unrelenting as that from which he suffered in life. His faults were upon
        the surface, but these faults, which are to-day reflected in his writings,
        were such as to excite the keenest antagonism in the minds of many persons
        who were thrown with him. His enemies during his life were not more bitter
        than his enemies have been since his death. The spirit animating the most
        persistent detractors of Smith has been at once puerile and ignoble. That
        this great man was egotistic and self assertive, it is impossible to deny,
        but that he was brave, steadfast, saga cious, and far-seeing, no one will
        question who approaches the study of his career with the critical faculty
        free from all prejudice. His example and his teachings were in every instance
        marked by the highest practical wisdom. His services in the first settlement
        of Virginia were of incalcu lable value in their influence, and the general
        voice of the Colony and the State has not been incorrect in proclaiming him
        the real founder of the community.', 1]

        \ what may be called its internal economy. The Charter of Incorporation was\
        \ granted by James I., and dates from 1608. It was in 1774, however, that\
        \ the era of town improvement set in, a special Act having been provided for\

        \ in due time by other Acts, all in one way or another making \" further provision\
        \ for the improvement and good government of the borough.\" During the present\
        \ reign no less than seven such Acts have been passed. The municipal buildings\
        \ occupy a prominent site in St. Mary Street. The Town Hall was first erected\
        \ in 1849, from designs prepared by Mr. Horace Jones, of London. Eventually,\
        \ it became necessary to provide additional accommodation at a cost 9s \xA3\
        \\ 3, 000. The Free Library is an institution of which the town is justly\
        \ proud. The earliest public collection of books in Cardiff, Mr. John Ballinger,\
        \ Chief Librarian, tells us, was the library of the Glamorganshire and Cardiff\
        \ Literary and Scientific Institute, located in Crockherbtown, established\
        \ about the year 1838, and came to an end in 1867. In 1862 the town adopted\
        \ the Public Libraries' Act, and the present Library and Museum buildings\
        \ were erected in 1881-2, at a cost of .\xA310,000, exclusive of the site\
        \ and decorations. An extension of the buildings at a further cost of ,\xA3\
        16,000, is now rapidly approaching completion. In the Free Library buildings\

        \ of the Custom House date from 1845, and those of the Board of Trade from\

        \ and only a few days before his death, a life-long friend called to see him,\
        \ and found him engaged with his lawyer in making some alterations in his\
        \ will. He told this friend that he had thought of giving a sum of money to\
        \ the city of Waterbury for the founding and support of a free public library.\
        \ \"How much,\" inquired the friend, \" do you propose to give ? $100,000\
        \ ? \" \" Yes,\" he answered, and after a short pause added, \"Make it $200,000.\"\
        \ This was the sum named in a codicil attached at that time to his will, and\
        \ this, less a succession tax of $12,000, was the amount paid to the city\
        \ of Waterbury after his death. \u2022 This building is still standing and\

        \ was a farmer, and as a lad he made trial of work as jeweller, farmer and\

        \ to Yale, entering as a sophomore, and graduated in 1849 in the same class\
        \ with President Dwight. In the last term of his sophomore year Mr. Poole\
        \ was appointed assistant librarian of the society of Brothers in Unity, which\
        \ had a library of 10,000 volumes. He held his position only a few weeks before\

        \ what the bound sets of periodicals contained. He immediately set about supplying\
        \ this need by preparing an index to these volumes, and in a year the work\
        \ was so far advanced that the society voted to print it. While the printing\
        \ was in progress, George P. Putnam of New York assumed the whole pecuniary\
        \ responsibility of its publication, and the work appeared in 1848 with Mr.\

        \ with the cooperation of the American Library association and the Library\

        of any single library in the country. In 1887 he was elected librarian of
        the Newberry library in Chicago, founded by the late Walter L. Newberry, who
        endowed it with $3,000,000. The selecting of works for this library was the
        crowning achievement of his life, as it was intended to be principally a library
        of reference and to contain ultimately 4,000,000 volumes. Death prevented
        him from seeing the result of his toil, as he passed away at Evanston, 111.,
        March 1, 1894. His wife, who survived him, was the daughter of Dr. Edward
        W. Gleason of Bos ton. Four children, of the seven born to them, are still
        living. In 1882 Mr. Poole received the degree of LL. D. from the North western
        university. He did much to direct the development of libraries in the Northwest,
        and was a leader in the movement for practical utility and convenience in
        library buildings as opposed to mere architectural effect. In the field of
        early New England his tory his pen was constantly on the alert to expose the
        pet fallacies of the villifiers of the founders. He was an earnest promoter
        of the University Extension movement, and his reputation as a libra rian extended
        to England and the Continent. WILLIAM I. FLETCHER, M. A. William Isaac Fletcher,
        son of Stillman and Elizabeth (Sever ance) Fletcher, was born in Burlington,
        Vt., April 28, 1844. Four years later his parents removed to Winchester, Mass.,
        and Mr. Fletcher''s early education was conducted in the common schools of
        that town and others in the state. In 1867 he removed to Hartford and remained
        there for two years, after which he came to Water bury. Mr. Fletcher resided
        here for three years, during which time he was librarian of the Bronson library.
        After leaving Waterbury he passed two years in Lawrence, Mass., and then returned
        to Hart ford, where he remained until 1883. He then removed to Amherst, Mass.,
        where he has since been engaged as librarian of the Amherst college library.
        He has published an " A. L. A. Index to General Literature " and " Public
        Libraries in America," and edited a "Coop erative Index to Periodicals " from
        1883 to 1893. He also collabo rated with Dr. W. F. Poole on his " Index to
        Periodical Literature " and its supplements, which appeared in 1887 and 1892.

        1850 to 1858 spent his winters teaching in Ohio and Connecticut, and his summers
        upon his farm in Roekport. He taught in Wolcott in 1850, ''51, ''52 and ''53,
        in Berea in 1856 and ''57, and during the winter of 1858 and ''59 in Waterville.
        He spent part of 1858 in Kansas, and in the spring of 1859 came to this city
        and opened a private school on the second floor of the building afterward
        occupied by the Bronson library (see pp. 41, 534). After eight years, during
        which time the school prospered, he was obliged to discontinue it on account
        of ill health. In 187 1, in con connection with the life insurance business,
        he started a real estate and fire insurance agency. Since 1872 he has been
        librarian of the Bronson library, was town treasurer for one year, and was
        a mem ber for many years of the board of education and the board of school
        visitors. Mr. Bassett''s taste for natural history led him early in life to
        make a practical study of botany, so that he is familiar with most of the
        flowering plants of western New England, northern Ohio and eastern Kansas.

        observations in this comparatively unworked field. Mr. Bassett''s literary

        of M. L. Sperry (page 291), was born in Waterbury, and spent her girlhood

        time, and passed a year at the Young Ladies'' institute in this city (now
        St. Mar garet''s school). From 1874 to 1876 she resided in Minneapolis, Minn.,
        in the home of a sister, and in 1877 and 1878 was in the family of her brother,
        Lieutenant C. S. Sperry, at Annapolis, Md. She returned to Waterbury in 1879,
        and in October, 1883, was ap pointed assistant librarian at the Bronson library.
        She remained in this position, which she filled with marked ability, until
        the autumn of 1892, when she entered the widely known Library school connected
        with the state library at Albany, N. Y. She was in the Bronson library again
        from July to December, 1893, but returned to Albany, and became a cataloguer
        in the state library in January, 1894. In June following, she graduated from
        the Library school, with exceptionally high honors. Shortly after ward she
        received an appointment as assistant librarian in the Carnegie library at
        Braddock, Penn., and in March, 1895, was pro moted to the position of librarian.

        John H. Moran; secretary, William C. Keenan. On June 19, 1870, the society
        was reorganized and its name changed to that which it now bears. Its primary
        object, from its organization until now, has been mutual improvement in elocution,
        history and debate. It has a library of over 400 volumes and a membership
        of ninety in good standing. The society has gained an enviable reputation
        in other than intellectual fields. It has on more than one occasion assisted
        the needy and contributed generously to religious and patriotic objects. In
        1879, when famine swept over Ireland, it contributed $75 for the relief of
        the sufferers. In 1881 it donated $100 on the occasion of laying the corner
        stone of St. Patrick''s church. It was in the rooms of this society that the
        representatives of the different Catholic societies of the city met during
        the Land League agitation of 1884, and perfected arrangements for the lecture
        which was given in the City hall by John Boyle O''Reilly, and which netted
        $1000 for the Irish cause. In their rooms also the remains of the Irish patriot,
        Stephen J. Meany (page 987), lay in state until prepared for transportation
        to Ireland for burial. The body was taken over in charge of Martin Scully,
        a member of the society, who was chosen for this honorable and responsible
        duty by the Catholics of Waterbury and the Press club of New York city. On
        April 9, 1893, the rooms of the society were destroyed by the fire that occurred
        in the Lilley block. When the building was ready for occupancy the society
        returned and fitted up more elegant rooms than they had before occupied. When
        the late Bishop McMahon was selecting lay delegates to represent the diocese
        of Hartford at the World''s Fair Columbian Catholic congress, which convened
        m the Art Institute, Chicago, on September 4, 1893, the society was honored
        by the appointment of its president, Martin Scully, to represent the Catholics
        of Water bury. During its twenty-five years of existence the society has brought
        to the city many lecturers of national reputation. Its rooms have been the
        scene of many intellectual gatherings. Its influence among the Catholic young
        men of the city has been most salutary. The following were the officers of
        the society in 1895: President, James M. Lynch; vice-president, Henry J. Kennaugh;

  - - ['PREFACE IN gathering materials for these Annals my first idea was only to
        trace the history of Cohnsburgh, and I then thought that a pamphlet of forty
        or fifty pages would be sufficient; but as the subject was investigated the
        materials greatly increased and the story became more interesting. And besides,
        one can hardly write of Scotchmen two centuries ago without saying something
        of their religion, since that occupied so much of their thoughts and had so
        much to do in forming their char acter, and this led me to give some account
        of the church life of the parish. I have tried to tell the story with as few
        dry details as possible, so that it may be found interesting to the general
        reader; and I have spared no pains to obtain accurate information, having
        searched all the available original documents as well as much printed matter.
        The authorities are given in all cases where this seemed needful. I am specially
        indebted to the Right Honourable the Earl of Crawford for the ready access
        he so kindly gave me to the historical treasures at Haigh Hall, and only in
        a lesser degree to his obliging librarian, Mr J. P.', 1]

        He might never have known had it not been for an accident, a thing quite fortuitous
        and apparently insignificant, that in reality changed the dreadful hopelessness
        and consistent failure of his life in dreary London to sunshine and the hope
        that leads to fresh endeavour. It was one evening, when he was thinking of
        going home, and had gathered together the books he had been reading, that
        he noticed a gold-rimmed pair of spectacles lying upon the floor beside him.
        Half a minute before he had seen his next neigh bour rise from his seat and
        depart, and he at once recollected that the old man who had occupied that
        particular chair so often of late weeks was in the habit of wearing such a
        pair of spectacles. He picked them up, intending to hand them over to the
        librarian, together with his books ; but as he walked up to the centre table
        and returned the volumes he caught sight of the owner of the spectacles pushing
        through the doors of the Reading- Room. Ralph hurried after him, and was so
        for tunate as to find him in the lobby, claiming his umbrella.', 1]

        \ of committee. On the 30th of September the poet presented four books to\
        \ the library \u2014 Smollett's Humphrey Clinker, Mackenzie's Julia de Roubigne,\
        \ Knox's History of the Reformation, and De Lolme on Tlie Constitution of\
        \ England. Mr M'Eobert, sometime librarian, used to tell a curious story which\
        \ he learned directly from Mr Thomson, subsequently Provost of Dumfries, with\
        \ whom Burns had left the volumes. Early in the morning after the presenta\
        \ tion was made, the poet came to Mr Thomson's bedside before he was up and\
        \ asked anxiously to be permitted to see the copy of De Lolme, as he feared\
        \ he had written something upon it ' which might bring him into trouble.'\
        \ On the book being brought, he looked at the inscription which he had written\
        \ on the back of the frontispiece \u2014 a portrait of the author \u2014 on\
        \ the preceding night ; and having procured some paste, he covered the inscription\
        \ by pasting the adjoining fly-leaf to the frontispiece. The inscription is\
        \ : Mr Burns presents this book to the Library, and begs they will take it\
        \ as a Creed of British Liberty \u2014 untill they find a better. R. B. The\
        \ leaves are now separate, and the inscription, in the Poet's best and boldest\
        \ hand, is still as legible as on the day when he wrote it. The book is now\
        \ the property of the Dumfries and Maxwelltown Mechanics' Library. Burns's\
        \ alarm lest the writing of this innocent-looking sentence should bring him\
        \ into trouble is quite intelligible when it is re membered that at the trial\

        \ of the evidence tendered against him was the testimony of his servant, Ann\
        \ Fisher, to the effect that he had purchased and distributed certain copies\
        \ of Paine's Rights of Man. The stress laid upon that testimony by the Crown\
        \ counsel had excited much remark. It might well appear to Burns, a Government\
        \ officer, that his conduct at such a crisis ought to be in the highest degree\
        \ circumspect. It was probably about the same time that, according to a well-authenticated\
        \ tradition, he called upon his sometime neighbour, George Haugh, the blacksmith,\
        \ and handing him copies of Paine's Common Sense and Rights of Man, desired\
        \ him to keep these books for him,", 1]

        is well known by reputation among the librarians of the country as one of
        the most progressive and effi cient libraries of any city of equal size in
        the United States. Recently there were 13,495 people enrolled as active mem
        bers, who drew for home use 267,054 volumes. This places Los Angeles eighth
        among the great cities of the country in the number of volumes circulated
        for home use, it being ahead of Cleveland and Cincinnati. The benevolent associations
        of a city give a good idea of the character of its citizens. Judged by this
        standard, Los Angeles ranks high. The Catholic Orphan Asylum, one of the most
        imposing buildings in the city, occupies an elevated site on Boyle Heights.
        It is one of the oldest institutions in Los Angeles, but has only been in
        its pres ent location about two years, and is doing a large amount of good
        work. Among such establishments is the Protes tant Orphan Asylum, which is
        now in its fifteenth year; the large brick building was erected in 1887. The
        aver age number of inmates has been about one hundred and fifty, a majority
        of whom are boys. The State pays sev enty-five dollars a year each for half-orphans
        and one hun dred dollars for full orphans, the balance being raised by voluntary
        contributions. The Young Men''s Christian Association occupies a floor and
        basement in the building at the corner of Sec ond Street and Broadway. It
        is doing active and success ful work, and is steadily growing in membership.
        Con certs and lectures are given to members. There are also free evening schools
        under good teachers. The gym nasium is one of the best in the State; it and

        in 1849, quoting Heath''s description of the architecture, remarks that the

        and antiquary to Henry VIII. For six years he travelled over England, collecting
        information as to castles, towns, religious houses, &c, and for another six
        years he attempted to set his notes in order. He died in 1552 after two years
        of melancholia, the result of too much research. His Itinerary and Collectanea

        and books, and a work-room. Adjacent is the Librarian''s Room, placed so as
        to command the Braithwaite Hall, Lending Library, and Entrance Hall. The Lending
        Library, 52 feet by 35 feet, contains eight, large, isolated double book-cases,
        as well as a considerable extent of wall cases, capable of accommodating about
        20,000 volumes ; the fittings are of oak. THE CORN EXCHANGE. The Corn Exchange
        is at the extreme West End of the site, approached by a flight of steps, with
        open arcaded porch and a vestibule. The Exchange room is 38 feet by 24 feet,
        with the angles canted off, making it an elongated octagon. It is top lighted
        and the tinting of the walls is grey in two shades, considered most suitable
        to the purpose of exhibiting samples of grain. Beneath the Exchange is a room
        of similar size which, as it has a separate entrance from Katharine Street,
        can be used either in connection with the Public Library or independently.
        There are also other rooms on the lower ground and first floors (adjoining
        Mint Walk), and in the roofs, which are purposely left unfinished. Thev are
        not at present required, but the exigencies of the site and the accommo dation
        which was required on the ground floor level necessitated their incorporation
        in the buildings. Taking into consideration the probability that additional
        duties will from time to time be placed on County Councils, it may reasonably
        be expected that use will be found for these unfinished rooms before many
        years have elapsed. One important portion of the building yet remains to be
        mentioned, viz. : that devoted to the rooms for the boilers, fuel, etc., the
        Engineers'' Workshop, and the Electric Light Switch-board Room, which are
        in a central position below the level of the lower ground floor, accessible
        from Mint Walk as well as from the interior of the buildings. The Boilers
        are for generating steam at a low pressure for warming the buildings by radiators,
        and to most of these the external fresh air can be admitted and passed, comfortably
        warmed, into the building in the cold weather. The radiators, in combination
        with the extract flues, which are connected with the upcast shaft from the
        furnaces, will not only warm, but ventilate the building. Proof of the efficiency
        of the system has been given during the past two winters, during which fires
        were kept up. It is probably to a great extent due to this warming and drying
        of the buildings that the excellent joinery has stood without showing any
        twists, cracks, or open joints. This account of the Buildings may fitly be

        \ for the preservation of memorials swept away within the past half-century,\
        \ but for the behoof of readers of the present generation. The first marked\

        \ been possible. Prior to that intrusion, the College had possessed several\
        \ outlets to the river, at one time well stocked with fish. There were the\
        \ Dairy-steps (initial I), the steps to the old Pump-court (initial J), others\
        \ to the Boat-house, and a long flight which must still be visible clinging\
        \ to the outer wall, and only terminating at the upper level of what is now\
        \ known as the Governor's Garden. This I am informed by the present courteous\
        \ Governor, Mr. AValter T. Browne, was formerly called the Scurvy Gatden.\
        \ He says : \" The reason it obtained this name is because in the early days\
        \ of the school, the boys afflicted with zymotic diseases were confined here\
        \ apart like the lepers of old. They also slept apart in the three small cells\
        \ adjoining, now used for other purposes.\" All these steps rose from a narrow\
        \ platform of rock slightly raised above the river at low water, and more\

        \ to dormitory. I then discovered that \"change,\" under the name of \"Progress\"\
        \ had begun its work internally. To provide more room tor the library, the\
        \ old museum had been displaced, and the bulk (or the \" rubbish,\" according\
        \ to Mr. John Plant, curator) transferred to the Peel Park Museum, where its\

    - ['1074 HISTORY OF CONCORD. beth Hoyt is the first Concord-born woman to establish
        herself here as a physician. An old resident, whose life covered eighty-seven
        years of the nine teenth century, said that in his school-days no girl was
        expected to study farther in arithmetic than the four elementary rules. The
        female mind yvas thought unworthy to share in full even the meager privileges
        of the " deestrick " schools. This man lived to see his niece (the writer)
        graduate from Vassar in 1881, the first Concord girl to take the baccalaureate
        degree. Almost as many girls as boys are now annually fitted for college at
        our high school. It was years after the whole teaching force of Concord, save
        the principal of the high school, was feminine before a woman, Mrs. Mary Parker
        Woodworth (Vassar, 1870), was elected a member of the board of education (1890).
        Six years later she had Mrs. Susan J. (Wentworth) Woodward as coadjutor, and
        noyv three women, Mrs. Susan C. Bancroft, Mrs. Ella H. J. Hill, and Mrs. Alice
        M. Nims, serve on the board. Women were granted school suffrage in 1878, and
        after the first few years, when it took some courage to face the novelty of
        the situation, they have attended the annual meeting in numbers equal to the
        men. Miss Grace Blanchard (Smith, 1882), the first woman to hold municipal
        office, became the accom plished and efficient city librarian in 1895. The
        average woman of the last generation found her chief recrea tion in sewing
        societies ; now she belongs to clubs. The Woman''s Edition of the Monitor,
        issued on Decoration day, 1896, undertook to enumerate all the clubs and philanthropic
        organizations in Con cord managed by women (exclusive of church societies).
        The num ber found was thirty-nine, and many new ones have been formed since
        then. A notable literary club was that started in the winter of 1876-77 in
        connection with the lectures of Mrs. Abba Goold Woolson, then a resident of
        our city. Among the active members were Mrs. Charles C. Pearson, Mrs. John
        M. Hill, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph B. Walker, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel C. Eastman, Mrs.
        William H. Bart lett, Mrs. John Abbott, Mrs. J. N. Patterson, Mrs. Martha
        Bouton Cilley, Mrs. Albert B. Woodworth, Mrs. George E. Jenks, Mrs. Sarah
        M. K. Adams, Mrs. Franklin Low, Mrs. Sarah Neal Harris, Mrs. Helen Mar Bean,
        Mrs. William M. Chase, Misses Clara M. Fowler, Elizabeth S. Stevens, Minnie
        W. Fiske, Susan B. Walker, Frances K. Adams, and Frances M. Abbott. The club
        met about at houses, but it was largely under the direction of Judge Fowler,
        whose library and hospitable home were ever at its service. As lecturer, author,
        and leader in social progress, Mrs. Woolson was the most yvidely known woman

        in 1857, a more advanced course of study prescribed, and a higher standard
        of preparation required for admission. Then, for the first time, did it become
        a real high school. In compliance with a request in a petition signed by Dr.
        Timothy Haines and others, a course of instruction in the natural sciences
        was estabhshed, and a beginning made in the purchase of necessary apparatus.
        Henry Edmund Sawyer (Dartmouth, 1851), of Henniker, yvho had been principal
        of Francestown academy and of the high school at Great Falls, yvas installed
        as the first principal of the reorganized school, yvith Misses Dunn and Palmer
        continuing as assistants. The school numbered from eighty to one hundred pupils,
        and under Mr. Sayvyer became very popular. Its friends began to think that
        it deseiwed better accommodations, and an effort yvas made the same year to
        obtain a more modern budding. This attempt led to a spirited controversy not
        fully settled until the spring of 1858. "The original proposal," says Joseph
        B. Walker, " yvas urged with great ability, but the discussion soon developed
        a fear that the interests of the high school were being advanced somewhat
        to the neglect of those of lower grades, and a proposi tion to build two new
        brick grammar schoolhouses, one at each end of the city, yvas at the last
        carried by acclamation." In accordance yvith this action, instead of the building

        \ of the earliest teachers who kept a popular singing school in the toyvn\

        \ to give, was frequently good and greatly enjoyed ; but in rooms in which\

        \ 143) The humorous description of the interest taken in theological subtleties\
        \ by the mechanics and slaves of Constantinople is quoted by Gibbon on the\
        \ authority of Jortin, but Gibbon acknowledges that he does not know where\
        \ it comes from, and implies that Jortin does not state his source. A striking\
        \ instance of the slumbers of Homer. Jortin indeed omits to give the res erence,\

        \ Nyssa, with whom he is dealing in the context. It would seem from Gibbon's\

        \ of the Frigidus. This is likewise attested by Prudentius (against Symm.,\

        \ the objections urged by Tillemont against it seem quite decisive, and it\
        \ is rejected by Clinton and most authorities. It is a case of a confusion\
        \ between the suppression of Maximus and the suppression of Eugenius ; the\
        \ visit to Rome after the second war is merely a duplicate of the visit after\
        \ the first war. Giildenpenning thinks that Theodosius sent a message to the\
        \ senate signifying his will that pagan worship should cease (Der Kaiser Theodosios,\
        \ p. 229-30). 11. THE LIBRARIES OF ALEXANDRIA\u2014 (P. 199, 201) \"The valuable\
        \ library of Alexandria was pillaged or destroyed.\" That is, the lesser library\
        \ in the Serapeum, which was situated in the Rhacotis quarter of the city.\
        \ Gibbon has failed to distinguish it from the great Library of the Brucheum,\
        \ of which Zenodotus, Callimachus and other famous scholars were librarians.\
        \ This Library is said to have been burnt down when Caesar was in Alexandria\
        \ (but see Mahaffy, Egypt under the Ptolemies, p. 454). For the distinction\
        \ of the two libraries see Epiphanius, de mensuris et ponderibus, 168 (Migne,\
        \ Patr. Gr. vol. 43, p. 256) : in Si vo-repov km iripa iyivero iv Tt_ _iepa7rt_>\
        \ [sic] j_i_poTe'pa ttjs n-puir^s, ijris km 8vyaT)tp avop-doSi) a.nj;. For\
        \ the first or mother library, see ib. 166 (Migne, p. 249). For other references\
        \ see Susemihl, Geschichte der alexandrinischen Litteratur, i. p. 336. But\
        \ is it an attested fact that the lesser or daughter library was destroyed\
        \ in a.d. 391? The sanctuary of Serapis was demolished, but does that imply\
        \ the demolition of all the buildings connected with the Serapeum ? ' The\
        \ only evidence on which Gibbon's statement rests is the sentence which he\
        \ quotes from Orosius (p. 201, n. 53). But Orosius does not mention the Serapeum\
        \ or speak of a large library. He merely says that he had seen bookcases in\
        \ temples (which he does not name) ; and that, since then, he had been informed\
        \ that the temples had been pillaged and the bookcases emptied. It seems to\
        \ me highly improbable that Orosius is thinking either of the Alexandrian\
        \ library or of the Serapeum. There is no reason to suppose that the library\
        \ was in the temple. I conclude then that there is no evidence that the library\
        \ of the Serapeum did not survive till the Saracen conquest, notwithstanding\
        \ the verdict of Susemihl [ib. 344): \"Omar sand 642 schwerlich noch Biicher\
        \ in Alexandreia zu verbrennen \". IThe statement of Eunapius in the Vita\

        \ at a later time were J. R. and H. S. Robinson, J. Thissell, Bay State Shirt\

        \ which proved more lucrative. It vvas made in part an exhibition of home\

        several interruptions on account of ill health, until his death. He was for
        a time assistant of the Ameri can Unitarian Association, and afterwards secretary
        of the Sunday School Society. This work he carried on in connec tion with
        his regular pastoral duties. He was the compiler of the "Hymn and Tune Book"
        so commonly used in Unitarian churches. He died in Cambridge in May, 1886.
        Mrs. Livermore is still living in Cambridge. After Rev. L. J. Livermore went
        away, the pulpit was occupied for several months by Rev. William Cushing.
        He was a brother of Mrs. Franklin Forbes, and was the son of Hon. Edmund Cushing
        of Lunenburg. William Cushing was born May 15, 181 1. He graduated from Harvard
        Col lege in 1832. He taught school in Fitchburg. He gradu ated from the Harvard
        Divinity School in 1839. He was ordained at Calais, Me. He also preached in
        Saco, Me., and at Bedford, Mass. In 1843, ne formed the first Unitarian Society
        in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the same year, he married Margaret Louisa Wiley.
        He lived for many years on a farm in the southern portion of the town on the
        banks of Mine Swamp and Spring Brooks, near the point where they enter the
        river. He served on the school committee from 1863 to 1868. In the latter
        years of his life, he was assistant librarian at Harvard University. He published
        several volumes bearing on library work, of which his " Ini tials and Pseudonyms"
        is the best known. He died in Cam bridge, August 27, 1895. April 4, 1858,
        Rev. Jared M. Heard was engaged to preach. He belonged to the Heard family
        which is so prominent in Wayland. He graduated from Brown Uni versity in 1852.
        On account of ill health, he was obliged to give up his studies for a time,
        and he made a journey to India. He did not fully recover his health, however,

        production of the plant in a remarkable degree. There were no loose ends in
        his work, no waste. The total amount of available forces used always balanced
        accurately with the total results secured. But his story belongs to later
        history. Yet even in his boy hood he displayed those qualities which were
        to make him the paymaster in 1861, the superintendent in 1866, the worthy
        successor of Franklin Forbes in 1877, and a recognized leader among the manufacturers
        of the country before he retired from the agency in 1896. Passing by his early
        connection with the Rhetorical Society, the Unitarian Society and the schools,
        we find that there is one department of the life of our community in which
        his work vvas such that it must re ceive mention. No one gave as much time
        or rendered such efficient service to the Bigelow Library Association as he.
        For years he acted as librarian and hundreds of pages of the records of the
        secretary and treasurer are in his hand-writing. Since the library has come
        under the control of the town, he has continued his fostering care, and to
        those who know his work in this direction he seems almost as closely identified
        with the library as with the Lancaster Mills. James A. Weeks, the son of Jonathan
        Weeks and father of George W., was born in Alstead, N. H., in 181 1, February
        7th. He belonged to the well known Weeks family which lived in Marlboro. He
        worked on the farm of his uncle, Solomon Weeks of Marlboro, from early boyhood.
        From the age of fourteen to twenty he drew wood nearly every winter from Marlboro
        to Boston. He married Caroline Hall of Brewster, Mass., June 19, 1835. At
        twenty, he went to Waltham and began work in the picker room of a cotton mill.

        in those days. A collection of minerals was begun in 1862, and in a few years
        there were a thousand varieties. Collections bearing on local history were
        also made by the librarian. After the resignation of Mr. Weeks in 1867, H.
        H. Waters and G. W. Morse served as librarians for a short time each. January
        2, 1869, J. H. Hunt vvas elected, and he continued to serve until 1873. The
        growth of the library vvas not as great during the twelve years from 1861
        to 1873, as it had been in the pre ceding ten years, for in 1873 there were
        only four thousand four hundred and eight volumes on the shelves, a gain of
        less than a hundred per ye,ar. At a meeting held August 4, 1S73, a committee
        which had been appointed "to consider the donating of the books and other
        property of the library to the Town of Clinton," reported: "That, whereas
        the establishment of the Bigelow Library Association was originally intended
        for the good of the people at large, and whereas, the formation of the Free
        Public Library will more effectually secure the design of the Association.
        The committee recommend to the stock hold ers of the Association to grant
        to the Town of Clinton all the books, pamphlets and periodicals, and all articles
        of natural history belonging to the Association." This dona tion was made
        and accepted on certain conditions, and the Bigelow Free Public Library was
        established. The Bigelow Library Association proved not only an educational
        blessing, but a business success, for its shares paid a final dividend of
        forty-seven dollars. It vvas not until 1877, that, after all settlements had
        been completed, the Bige low Library Association which had for so many years
        been the center of culture for the community, ceased to exist. The first number

        the pulpit vvas occupied successively by Revs. Peabody, Daven port and Adams.
        The starting of the evangelical church in Lancaster Center in 1839 and the
        evangelical church in Clin tonville in 1844, removed the need of a church
        at such a dis tance from either village, and so the services there were given
        up.* The First Evangelical Congregational Church in Lancas ter, which was
        organized in February, 1839, had in 1844 twenty-six members from Clintonville,
        and the number of those attending service from here must have been much larger.
        Among these were the Bigelows and many other of the most prominent citizens.
        The first meetings of this congregation were at the house of Rev. Asa Packard,
        a re tired minister then living in Lancaster. Rev. Charles Pack ard was ordained
        January 1, 1840. The dedication of the meeting-house occurred December 1,
        1849. In the early forties, John P. Houghton carried an omnibus load of people
        from Clintonville to Lancaster Center every Sunday morning to attend the Congregational
        and Unitarian services there. As early as 1840, a Sabbath School was gathered
        for weekly study of the Bible by the Evangelical Congregation alists of Clintonville.
        The meetings were held in the brick school-house on Main Street, the use of
        which was obtained after much opposition. The first contribution taken up
        was for a library. It amounted to thirty dollars. H. N. Bigelow was the first
        superintendent; Henry Lewis, assistant super intendent; James S. Lawrence,
        secretary and treasurer, and Amos Holbrook, librarian. Carter Wilder, John
        Lowe, The odore Jewett and Joseph B. Parker were also prominently connected
        with its organization. The latter was a superin tendent from 1842. Congregationalists,
        Baptists and Meth odists attended the school. The "Union Question Book" was
        used. There was also a preaching service held here at *For full account of

        room on the second floor of the Kendall Building. C. G.Stevens, who had an
        office in the building, acted as the first librarian. This reading room vvas
        not frequented by ladies or children, and it really- became a sort of club
        room for the members of the Institute, who gathered there to read and talk.
        Any resident of Lancaster, not a member of the Institute, could have the privileges
        of the reading room by paying three dollars per year. Later, the library vvas
        moved to the second floor of A. P. Burdett''s Block. The interest in the lectures
        and debates evidently declined after the first year, and the energy the society
        possessed was given mainly to the read ing room and library. On account of
        the desire of the members of the Institute to control its affairs directly,
        rather than through a board of trustees, at a meeting held May 10, 1849, the
        constitution was so changed as to accomplish this end. Thus, new life was
        infused into the organization. There was a course of twelve lectures during
        the winter of 1847-48, with an average attendance of somewhat over one hundred.
        Among the names of the lecturers for the following year, we find those of
        Ralph Waldo Plmerson, Horace Greeley, Edwin P. Whip ple and Henry D. Thoreau.
        Similar courses of lectures were held during the two succeeding years, and
        the number attending was sometimes as large as four hundred. G. N. Bigelow
        was president of the society from 1849 to 1852, and then J. T. Dame vvas chosen.
        In 1850, there were three hundred and eighty books in the library; in 1852,
        there were six hundred and sixty-seven. The location was changed from the
        Kendall Block to the A. P. Burdett building. It was found desirable in 1852,
        to change the Institute into a legal corporation. To do this to advantage
        a complete re organization seemed necessary. June 19th, a meeting was held
        for the organization of a society in the form of a cor poration "for mutual
        improvement and the promotion of education." This corporation took the name

        \ to appal the languid readers of our days, while the titles of some of his\
        \ books, Rasura Tonsoris, Chimaera Pythagorica, Medicus Medicatus, and the\
        \ like, remind us of the catalogue of the choice books in the Library of St.\
        \ Victor, at Paris, as given in Rabelais. No human being can be supposed to\
        \ have even glanced at those ponderous volumes, but it is remarkable that\
        \ they and the author should have escaped the notice of so diligent an investigator\
        \ of the byways of literary history as Isaac D'lsraeli. Ross is fairly entitled\
        \ to some notice in the local history of the Isle of Wight, and I propose\
        \ laying before my readers a short sketch of the life and works of my predecessor\
        \ in the Vicarage of Carisbrooke, the materials of which have been derived\
        \ from Wood's Athen\xE6 Oxonienses, ed. Bliss, the biographical works of Chalmers\
        \ and Granger, along with some information gathered from papers in Queen's\
        \ College, Oxford, and in the parish chest of the Carisbrooke Registers. Alexander\
        \ Ross, or Rosse, was born at Aberdeen in 1590. the year in which James VI\
        \ of Scotland \u2014 our James I \u2014 was married to Anne of Denmark. The\
        \ name of Ross is borne by several families of good birth, and there were\
        \ Earls of Ross. There is nothing to show that the future Isle of Wight vicar\
        \ had any pretensions to what the Scotch call ' sibness ' with gentle blood\
        \ and breeding. Like many an Aberdeenshire lad since his day, this keen-witted\
        \ young Scotchman with a craving for learning proceeded from the Grammar School\
        \ to the large and stately fabric of the King's College of Aberdeen, which\
        \ even now with its cloister-like repose and mouldering court-yards carries\
        \ us back into the Scotland of the Stuarts. In that ancient seat of what are\
        \ expressively called by Scotchmen the ' humanities' Ross, besides learning\
        \ much Latin and less Greek, was disciplined in that dry and dogmatic metaphysical\
        \ theology, which tended to imbue the minds of the hard-headed and saturnine\
        \ Scotch scholars of that period with principles as firm and incapable of\
        \ being uprooted as their own mountains. The Stuart King, James. had a strong\
        \ flavour of erudition about him. During his reign men of letters became more\
        \ than they had ever been before a profession with James as their royal patron.\

  - - ['ROVING MUSICIANS. i. DURING a period of what the trade papers call " severe
        commercial depression " four Manchester men, among hundreds of others, found
        themselves without work. This might not have affected their minds much but
        for the consequent detail of being left without wages also, a small matter
        to which they attached undue importance unless Euclid was mistaken in asserting
        that a whole cannot be less than one of its parts. They were handicraftsmen
        by trade and orchestral instrumentalists by profession, having consequently
        two sets of resources for earning a livelihood, yet both callings were unpro
        ductive for the time. There was Gooch, for instance, who played a curly tubular
        affair that swelled in a brazen crescendo from a thin gaspipe at one end to
        a wide bell at the other, something like a brass ammonite stretched in a pre-historic
        yawn. When he blew steadily into this condensing engine through the small-bore
        tube and worked a clenched fist about spasmodically inside the hollow bell
        Gooch could produce most surprising sounds and effects, ranging all the way
        from tones smoother than butter to quite weird and strident noises, enough
        to make war in anybody''s heart. He was an ex tremely tall man and unnecessarily
        increased his apparent length by wearing a silk bat. There was the Professor
        too, who perhaps should have been mentioned first, as he played the clarionet
        and so always appro priated the tuny parts in concerted music. Tawny skin
        and closely curling black hair showed a dash of Creole blood in him, a certain
        fire and spirit in his performances coming from the same source, but his gentle
        kindly disposition was all his own. There was Mitchell also, master of the
        sauve viola, who drew his bow with a skill worthy of Robin Hood and made himself,
        or was expected to make himself useful variously as collector, librarian,
        secretary, and what not. Impartially considered he ought to have been the
        most important man of the four, if he had cared to push himself forward, or
        that obtrusive fellow Gooch had given anybody else a chance to shine. It would
        be hopeless to attempt a description of Mitchell''s appearance. He was intensely
        neutral all over, purely conventional, neither fat nor lean, ugly nor handsome.
        He had no feature that a describer could lay hold of, unless it was a very
        ordinary nose; there was no telling where to begin with him, and, supposing

        \ Before they reached it the deep tuneful notes of his viola came to their\
        \ ears through the open door. There was the lost librarian, swinging gently\
        \ in a rocking chair beside a cheerful fire, playing with masterly hand sweet\
        \ melodies he loved. His eyes were upturned in silent joy, his face was serene.\
        \ Who so happy as the musician enthralled by his art ? As Gooch was speechless\
        \ with rage, Jarvis stepped forward and applied a little cold sarcasm. \"\
        You turned up at the practise to-night ?\" \"Practise?\" said Mitchell, still\
        \ gently sawing at the strings. \"Yes, I've been practising all night. These\
        \ are some little things I thought would be useful while we are off on the\
        \ trip. Sit down, all of you, and listen.\" \" Lord help me to keep my fingers\
        \ off him !\" Gooch muttered sotto voce, his eyes turning bloodshot, his fists\
        \ convulsively clenching themselves until the nails did not pierce the skin.\
        \ \"Look here now, Mitchell,\" said the Professor, \"this isn't good enough.\
        \ Here we arrange for a rehearsal and sit waiting for you three blessed hours,\
        \ and here you sit like a blessed angel, as if it didn't matter a demisemiquaver\

        \ ? So we did \u2014 I recollect now. Well, why didn't you go on without me\
        \ ?\" \"You sent us the cupboard key, didn't you ?\" Jarvis asked, in still\
        \ more frozen scorn. \" Have you wanted it ? Well, of course I didn't know.\"\
        \ \" We can rehearse without scores, can't we ? \" \" Oh, well, I didn't give\
        \ it a thought,\" said Mitchell. \" Why didn't you send across for the key\
        \ instead of gaping at one another all that time ? I've been at home all the\
        \ evening, so you couldn't have missed finding me.\" There was an interval\
        \ of silence lasting one minute, during which three countenances ran up and\
        \ down a chromatic scale of varying expression. Mitchell saw no reason for\
        \ distorting his own features, and consequently allowed them to remain in\
        \ repose. \" Give us the key now, you unwarrantable rallentando ! \" said\
        \ Gooch, venting his wrath in a voice of thunder. \"You can't have it to-night.\
        \ It's upstairs in the bedroom where my children are asleep, and you'll wake\
        \ them up, Gooch, shouting like that. Aren't you well ? What's the matter\
        \ ? \" \"Oh, nothing's the matter,\" Gooch spluttered, biting his lips till\
        \ no blood came. \"I never felt better in my life.\" \" Perhaps we'd better\
        \ have the trip first and practise after ? \" Jarvis said. \"Look here, now,\

        \ in a conciliatory manner. \" What", 1]

        pro. and another ? Can we have the blessed key or can we not ?" "I''d give
        five pounds for leave to throttle him," Gooch gasped, large drops of sweat
        falling from his face to the ground. " Money down if the Lord Chief Justice
        lives anywhere near. Of all the aggravating fiddlers ever I had to work with
        this is the worst?" " You all look excited," Mitchell innocently remarked,
        digging his chin well into the viola and delicately touching off an orna mented
        cadence. "Something or other must have upset you. Suppose we all meet at the
        bandroom to-morrow night and have a good grind ? " "And suppose you forget
        us again?" Jarvis sneered, turning up his nose. "Forget?" Mitchell repeated,
        with a slight incredulous laugh. " I''ve a pretty fair memory, thank goodness
        ! You may depend on me." "You forgot about to-night, though," said the Professor.
        "No," said Mitchell, looking up in surprise, while he still swung comfortably
        in his chair. "You are mistaken there. I didn''t just happen to think of it,
        that was all. The matter was in my mind right enough." There was no useful
        purpose to be served by arguing with a reasoner like that. The three left
        him placidly sawing bits of tune and walked off, Gooch''s splenetic bubblings
        dying away in the distance like a geyser going off the boil. II. Surely Mitchell
        would not have the face to disappoint them again, the three friends thought,
        and they repaired to the band room, feeling tolerably confident that the rehearsal
        would at least be successfully carried through. An hour''s waiting took the
        edge off their sanguine expectations, led to a comparison of watches and interchange
        of growls, even the Professor''s amiable temper be coming ruffled ; yet withal
        Mitchell gave no sign. Gooch was determined to get at the scores and so far
        make himself inde pendent of the missing librarian, and in pursuance of this
        idea he cut out the cupboard lock. Two or three slight accidents attended
        this operation. For one thing he stepped upon one end of a form to reach the
        cupboard and called for somebody to hold a candle while he worked. Jarvis,
        who happened to be sitting at the other end, rose to oblige his friend, whereupon
        up went the form and down went Gooch rolling across the floor, his silk hat
        none the better for being rubbed upon planks and sawdust. He gathered up his
        excessive length, glared ferociously down at Jarvis and snarled :', 1]
    - ['118 THE WORKS OF JOHN TRAFFORD CLEGG. "Why didn''t you say so last night ?"
        Jarvis shouted. " I didn''t happen to think of it just then," Mitchell answered,
        disappearing as he spoke. Gooch was moved to tears by the librarian''s inconsiderate
        behaviour. He sat down upon the form in a limp condition, lamenting the evil
        fate which had brought him into partnership with such a man. "Is it right
        that I should be treated like this?" he asked tearfully, and both his friends
        agreed that it was not, remarking at the same time that they didn''t very
        well see how it could be helped." " I shall be driven to shed his blood,"
        Gooch murmured, wiping his eyes on his sleeve, which was long enough to afford
        ample facilities for the purpose. '''' Mark my words, Professor. If that intolerable
        appogiatura goes with us on this trip I won''t be answerable for the consequences,
        and that''s all about it." The amiable Professor endeavoured to soothe him,
        so far as soothing was possible, but Jarvis accidentally made matters worse
        by observing that the band would expect somebody to pay for repairing the
        damaged cupboard. When it dawned upon Gooch that he was the body likely to
        be called upon his brine went off in steam, while his interior began to seethe
        and bubble like the varied contents of a stock-pan. Was he to have all the
        trouble of cutting the lock out and then be taxed with costs of damage ? Who
        was to pay him for his broken knife and cut finger ? Was not Mitchell clearly
        to blame for all the disturbance, and should not he be made liable for all
        expenses ? "Perhaps he''ll pay if you ask him," the Professor said. "Any how
        we may as well go home, for it''s no blessed use having a rehearsal till we
        can all join in. There''s nothing for it now but to have a blow-out in the
        train." The friends separated, leaving all final arrangements for the trip
        in Gooch''s hands, and that worthy man went home revolving in his hat a scheme
        for leaving troublesome Mitchell behind. The librarian as yet was ignorant
        as to the place they were bound for and the time for starting upon the journey.
        He should remain ignorant, Gooch determined, clenching his decision with muttered
        words of strong emphasis. The party should set off without him, trusting to
        pick up a capable viola grinder by the sea shore. If that plan failed they
        could play trios, filling out the programme with tenor songs from Jarvis.
        " I''ll forget to send the beggar word, that''s all," Gooch muttered, his
        wrath subsiding a little at the thought. " It''ll only be serving him with
        his own sauce." Two days remained before the trip. During that time Gooch
        took elaborate precautious for keeping out of Mitchell''s way, eventually
        setting off for the station very well pleased with him self in the belief
        that his troubles were over.', 2]

        \ a likely thing when he hadn't even known what town they were coming to until\

        \ nothing was said. Gooch cast a furtive look or two at Mitchell, who appeared\
        \ utterly un conscious that anything had happened. The impassive librarian\
        \ was a most unlikely subject to quarrel with. If attacked he would have presented\
        \ an innocent front and calmly asked for particulars of the night's occurrences,\
        \ propounding a series of simple questions that would as likely as not have\
        \ put Gooch altogether in the wrong. Such a man was best left alone. Mrs.\
        \ Brown asked if none of the gentlemen had been disturbed by a noise in the\
        \ night similar to the roof falling in, which she almost thought the gentleman\
        \ who went so late to bed had been trying his Guy Faux principles. \" No,\
        \ I wasn't,\" Mitchell replied in his disinterested way ; \" but we must have\
        \ a little discussion about that gunpowder when we can find time.\" Jarvis\
        \ said he had heard nothing and spoke truth, for even Gooch's fall had failed\
        \ to break his sound sleep, so the subject dropped and the friends prepared\
        \ themselves for a hard day's work. \" From morn to noon, from noon to dewy\
        \ eve, A summer's day.\" They toiled diligently, not altogether without reward,\
        \ as Mitchell succeeded in gathering close upon ten shillings before night.\
        \ If this was no great matter it was indisputably an encouraging im provement\
        \ upon previous experience, and gave some hope of further advance on the morrow.\
        \ On the way home they stopped to make one more attempt at charming the public.\
        \ Several interested listeners gathered round \u2014 \" audience fit though\
        \ few \" \u2014 and the musicians were gravely puffing their way through a\
        \ majestic adagio, when the stream of harmony was suddenly disturbed by a\
        \ loud juvenile voice, \" Hurry up, George, ! Here's Chang and General Tom\
        \ Thumb duetting on the telephone !\" This evident allusion to the disparity\
        \ in length between Gooch and Jarvis completely upset the decorum that had\
        \ so far attended the performance. Jarvis himself was forced to laugh, removing\
        \ his mouthpiece to do it and missing four bars. Having regained his wind\
        \ he further distinguished himself by making a wrong entry, which led to the\
        \ production of several awe-striking chords, and brought the quartet to an\
        \ abrupt end. It was high time to be getting home after that, they all thought\

        them, yet his presence was a little dis quieting. Three days later he disquieted
        them in earnest by civilly saying it was his duty to move them on, as the
        Council had passed a by-law confining entertainments of every kind to the
        beach. There, if provided with a licence to be had for ten shillings at the
        Town Hall, they had free scope and could blow themselves purple in the face
        with impunity. They thanked the man and retired drooping. " We haven''t ten
        shillings to waste in that speculation," Gooch remarked, " and if we had I
        shouldn''t be inclined to do it. The game''s up." " Busted," said the Professor
        in brief assent. That evening they took stock, struck a balance sheet, and
        discovered that when Mrs. Brown''s bill was paid they would have less than
        enough cash in hand to pay railway fares to Manchester. There seemed nothing
        for it but getting up early next morning and walking twenty miles or so of
        the distance, wearing their shoes to save their pockets. By way of a joke
        at supper Jarvis tried to borrow a sovereign from Heidelberg, who said his
        remittance had not yet found its way across the Channel, or he should have
        been charmed to assist countrymen of the great Shakspere. The German had frequently
        referred to the " little concert " during the past few days, and as often
        been gravely assured by Jarvis that deep thought was being given to that important
        question. Pressed to fix a date when all this cogitation might come to a head,
        Gooch thought they could settle it inside three months if there was no change
        in the weather. Heidelberg, perceiving he was being roasted, accepted his
        defeat with unalterable good humour, shook up his straw heap, and mentioned
        the concert no more. Nobody had seen Jones since the first evening. He had
        fortunately survived the dangerous shock administered to his digestion, and
        now took his meals in his own room. Mrs. Brown charged him extra for the privilege
        ; not, as she was careful to explain, because she cared for the money, but
        on account of the principle. Through these anxious days little had been seen
        of Mitchell. A fourth bed had been set up for him, and he had come and gone
        disturbing nobody, absent all day,'' late home at night, rising late every
        morning. When the wanderers rose to begin their journey he was snoring persistently
        in blissful oblivion. Gooch would not so much as look at him, but neither

        \ the press of Elzevir in Amsterdam. The printer, Daniel Elzevir, looked over\
        \ the manuscript, and was so alarmed by its con- tents that he notified the\
        \ English government, saying that \"there were many things in it which ought\
        \ to be suppressed.\" The govern- ment thereupon obliged the Skinners to give\

        a Natural His tory Society. After remarks from Dr. William Prescott, who had
        suggested the movement, and from Rev. Mr. Bouton, Franklin Pierce, Nathaniel
        G. Upham, Paul Wentworth, Henry H. Carroll, and others, it was voted, on motion
        of Stephen C. Badger, to be expedient to form such a society. A fortnight

        same year a corrrespondent of Hill''s New Hampshire Patriot wrote : " The
        Natural History Society, organized only the last spring, has enrolled more
        than two hundred resident members and about one hundred and twenty corresponding
        members, and promises to be an important auxiliary in diffusing and perpetuating
        a knowl edge of the natural productions of our state and country, as well
        as a most efficient means of self-culture. It has a hall, fifty by thirty
        feet, and a spacious room adjoining, in Ayer''s block on Main Street, at the
        southeast corner of the State House Yard. In these are contained five or six
        hundred specimens in geology and mineralogy ; one or two hundred in conchology
        ; a variety of insects ; interesting artificial curiosities ; and the nucleus
        of a library. Meetings are held Satur day afternoons with a view to mutual
        self-improvement." The interest in the society, thus early manifested, continued
        for some tune ; its cabinet was enriched ; addresses were delivered, and papers
        read at its meetings. It became also the depository of numer ous specimens
        of New Hampshire geology and mineralogy, collected by Dr. Charles T. Jackson,
        in his scientific survey of the state. But at last, after eighteen years of
        more or less active existence, it lost, in a fire, which, on the 22d of April,
        1864, destroyed the two upper stories of Ayer''s block (then called Sanborn''s),
        its hall with the val uable contents thereof, and never afterward renewed
        its praiseworthy efforts. Dr. William Prescott, a diligent scientist, and
        the society''s first president, had also his private cabinet of geology, mineralogy,

        \ be held, the proceeds to be appropri ated to the enlargement of the public\
        \ library. The suggestion was heeded. The library levee came off on Tuesday\
        \ evening, February 24, 1857, and this is the Statesman's enthusiastic description\
        \ of it: \"The Court-House and City-Hall building was all ablaze. Alow and\
        \ aloft, it was effulgent with burning gas. Notwithstanding the badness of\
        \ the traveling, the attendance was very large. The main tables were handsomely\
        \ laid, and abundantly supplied with the usual viands prepared for such occasions;\
        \ and from side-tables were dis pensed that class of luxuries for which consideration\
        \ is paid. The ladies of all religious societies were engaged in the undertaking,\
        \ and entered with zest into proceedings preparatory to opening the doors\

        \ gathering, \u2014 in one body, in beautiful and spacious apartments, \u2014\

        \ proceeds are to be prepared for circulation with all practical despatch.\"",

    - ["448 HISTORY OF CONCORD. One day in March, 1857, not long after this brilliant\
        \ and helpful levee, and before its proceeds could be realized in books, the\
        \ city library was opened to the public use, and its fourteen hundred vol\
        \ umes began to migrate from their shelves into the hands of eager readers.\
        \ Yearly cards were issued to patrons, or subscribers, upon the payment of\
        \ twenty-five cents. The purpose of this unburden some requirement was that\
        \ the annual amount of these small sub scription fees might, as it did, afford\
        \ relief \u2014 always acceptable, some times almost indispensable \u2014\
        \ to the finances of the institution. The third board of trustees was elected\
        \ a few clays after the opening of the library. At its organization, Amos\
        \ Hadley became president ; holding the position for fifteen of his seventeen\
        \ years of service as trustee. Before the end of the fiscal year, 1 857-'58,\
        \ more than three hundred volumes, purchased with the proceeds of the ladies'\
        \ levee, had increased the number of books intended for circula tion to nearly\
        \ seventeen hundred fifty. In their annual report, the trustees said : \"\
        \ During the past year the public library has been opened to the use of our\
        \ citizens. We are happy to say that its advantages have been very largely\
        \ enjoyed. The full attendance at the library-room during the hours of delivery,\
        \ and the avidity of the demand for books have attested that a public library\
        \ is an institution imperatively demanded by the intellectual wants of our\
        \ people.\" The first year's patronage, so gratifying to the trustees, was\
        \ to con tinue with a steady increase, year by year. The small yearly charge\
        \ to patrons was largely relied upon to pay the moderate salary of the first\
        \ two successive librarians, Andrew Capen and Fredericks. Craw ford, together\
        \ with sundry incidental expenses, such as re-covering and re-binding books.\
        \ But for supplying the constantly increasing demand for reading matter, consequent\
        \ upon increasing patronage, the library depended mainly upon appropriations\
        \ made by the city council. The aid offered at the outset to the library enterprise\
        \ by non-resident natives of Concord was not realized, probably because of\
        \ some change in the circumstances of those who offered it. The consequent\
        \ deficiency was, however, partially remedied from the proceeds of two levees\
        \ projected and carried out by the public spirited ladies of the city : the\
        \ first being held, as already described, just before the opening of the library\
        \ ; the second coining off in the summer of 1860, and netting for its purpose\
        \ one hundred sixty-two dodars. The city council's first appropriation in\
        \ favor of the library, after its establishment, came in 1858, and was only\
        \ fifty dollars. The next year an allowance of two hundred dollars was made,\

        \ and invited thereto not pecuniary aid but individual and corporate influence\
        \ in promoting the success of an enterprise so important and valuable. The\
        \ schools thus referred to were conducted under the auspices of the two leading\
        \ charitable organizations of the city. The sewing school of the Concord Female\
        \ Benevolent Association connected with the Unitarian church had been in successful\
        \ operation for seventeen years, when, in 1853, the Rumford Charity School\
        \ was instituted by the Concord Female Charitable Society \u2014 a movement\
        \ especially prompted by the reception of a legacy from the Countess of Rum\

        \ charge of Mrs. Capen, wife of the first city librarian, and had steadily\
        \ grown in favor, till its attendance increased from eight pupils to seventy.\
        \ This form of humane effort was, therefore, no doubtful experiment when the\

        \ from May to October of each year, destitute young girls, to be trained in\
        \ needle work, and in making up, from materials usually supplied by the societies,\

        \ moral, unsectarian instruction ; and to foster in them self-respect, promptness\
        \ in duty, neatness, love of order, and good manners. Those school seasons\
        \ bore promises of precious fruitage in the life of many a pupil. Of the fulfilment\
        \ of those promises, the closing sessions of the school terms gave constant\
        \ assurance ; while they were of themselves frequently occasions of much attractive\

        \ in 1872, from lack of a librarian, keys were furnished those who desired\
        \ access to the library. Upon the erection of the Board of Trade building\
        \ in 1873 the Association removed thither, and an employee took care of the\
        \ rooms at five dollars a week, but funds were collected slowly, and usually\
        \ the year ended with a debt. Afterwards, before 1900, the Association twice\
        \ changed its home, returning to Exchange block, and thence removing to desirable\
        \ and well-arranged quarters in a new building, bearing its name, and situated\
        \ at the corner of State and Warren streets. In November, 1873, the state\
        \ canvass began, and was continued seventeen years. Two other associations\
        \ were organized within the limits of Concord : one, at Fishervdle, in 1875\
        \ ; the other at West Concord, in 1877. These, in course of time, were discontinued.\
        \ In 1879, \u2014 or a little later, \u2014 when the condition of the Association\
        \ was decidedly unpromising, a Mr. Watkins, coming from New York, received\
        \ a pledge from zealous members to pay a general secretary for three months.\
        \ The experiment proved satisfactory ; and thence forward the general secretaryship\
        \ became a vital feature of organiza tion. From that date, too, more prosperous\
        \ years ensued. The Woman's Auxiliary, which was indeed to be an effective\
        \ helper, was established in 1887 ; and, in January, 1888, the Concord Young\
        \ Men's Christian Association was regularly incorporated. On the 31st of March,\
        \ 1895, the Boston & Maine Railroad Department was organized, with a chairman\
        \ and other officers, and with its own special work ; the final jurisdiction\
        \ being in the directorate of the elder organization. Its comfortable quarters\
        \ were located on Railroad Square, opposite the station. This department also\
        \ had its Woman's Auxiliary; and though celebrating in 1900 only its fourth\
        \ anniver sary \u2014 with its chairman, John F. Webster, presiding \u2014\
        \ yet it could report its fair share of successful effort contributed towards\

        to thank for the abolition of the old Provincial Board of Education, and for
        bringing to an end the efforts that had been so long and so determinedly made,
        to fasten on this Province, sectarian Protestant schools.* The great difficulty
        of procuring exact information with regard to school affairs is a cause of
        regret. Too frequently the secretary of the board performs his duties carelessly,
        the minutes being either unrecorded or recorded only on loose sheets of paper.
        Even when books are kept, they are liable to be lost or mislaid, as changes
        take place in the board of trustees ; and it is quite certain that this condition
        of things is not nearly so bad in Scarboro as in many other townships, where
        those in office have been, and are, less qualified to perform the necessary
        clerical labor. The suggestion is here made that inspectors should be instructed
        by the Minister of Education to examine the minute-book of each school board
        at least once a year, preferably, perhaps, as soon as possible after the annual
        public meeting, and to make such suggestions as may be deemed necessary for
        the purpose of main taining correct records. This course w7ould ensure transference
        of all documents from old to new officials, and minute-books out of date,
        or filled up, should be deposited in the county registry office, or in some
        other place of security. * Numerous references to the Appleton case will be
        found in the first two volumes of the " Documentary History of Education in

        one, and although the newer plan of selling or passing on to other schools,

        some of the volumes which constituted the first library. They are standard

        the year 1820 the Methodist circuits in Upper Canada were seven, viz., Detroit,
        Thames, West minster, Ancaster, Yonge Street, Duffin''s Creek, Niagara. It
        was from Yonge Street that Scarboro was served, and when it is understood
        that in 1805, this Circuit " included the townships on both sides of '' the
        street'' from the Bay of Toronto to Lake Simcoe ; as Scarboro, York, Etobicoke,
        Vaughan, Markham, King, Whit church and East and West Gwillimbury," some idea
        of its area may be formed. It is possible that it also included the hamlets
        of Toronto township, namely, Trafalgar and Nelson, of " The New Purchase."

        " first families " became the parents of a new generation, they craved for
        mental food of a quality superior to that supplied by the text-books and by
        the weekly newspaper. Dr. George Birkbeck, in Great Britain, had shown the
        practicability of establishing libraries for the use of mechanics, and the
        movement was in its prime during the first half of this century. It is not
        unlikely that the yeomen of Scarboro were thus influenced, to some extent
        ; but whatever the moving cause may have been, it is to their infinite credit
        that, on the 7th of April, 1834, a meeting was held in St. Andrew''s Church
        to organize a public library, which continued to be known as the Scarboro
        Subscription Library for a period of forty-four years, until, in 1878, it
        was incorporated as a Mechanics'' Institute under the Ontario Act. The first
        meeting, which would appear to have been as harmonious as it was well attended,
        resulted in the election of R. D. Hamilton, M.D., as President ; Robert Hamilton,

        aware of the advantages so long possessed by their up-stream neighbors, the
        residents of the eastern side of the township resolved to estab lish a Mechanics''
        Institute Library, entitled to a " legislative grant per annum." A meeting
        of pro minent persons was accordingly held at Highland Creek in December,
        1889, when it was decided to ask for incorporation, and an active committee
        was ap pointed to canvass the neighborhood for subscribers at $1 per annum.
        Fifty-five names were procured, and on January 28th, 1890, the Institute was
        incorporated. The first annual meeting was held in Elliot''s Hall, on Tuesday,
        the 13th of February following, when there were elected : Wm. Tredway, President
        ; Robert Cowan, Vice-President ; Henry Westney, Secretary- Treasurer ; A.

        funds were not large, consisting of $110, of which $25 was a grant from the
        Township Council, and $30 a donation from the Highland Creek Literary Society.
        On March 1, 1890, the Highland Creek Library was opened, and before the close
        of the year its membership numbered fifty-nine. Beginning with 167 well-selected

        Church of England. The middle class was the main support and prop of the Protestant
        Reformed Church of England. Honest Hugh Latimer, Bishop of Worcester, was
        a yeoman''s son. The citizens in their desire to uphold domestic morality
        and civil order were for an open Bible, as the defender of both these great
        principles of national prosperity, and on the side of the reformer, who desired
        to put down the super stitions which undermined domestic morality and national
        prosperity. Thomas James was one of these middle-class, resolute, and enlightened
        champions of the Reformed English Church. He had the English love of reality,
        and he was desirous, as will be seen, to find a reason for the faith that
        was in him. He was, writes Anthony a Wood, a native of Newport, I. W., born
        in or about 1571. The custom among tradesmen and yeomen in England was then,
        as for many years afterwards, to send the more bookish of their sons to the
        public or grammar schools, and from thence to Oxford and Cambridge. From the
        education, and still more from the manly, moral, and religious training, which
        they received in those seminaries of sound learning, some of these traders''
        sons rose to the highest offices in Church and State. The son of Mr. Fleming,
        the mercer in the corner-house turning into the Corn Market, became Lord Chief
        Justice of England. So high an office did not fall to the lot of Fleming''s
        kinsman, Thomas James, but one no less honourable, and quite unstained by
        that sycophancy which made Fleming a ready tool of the Government of the day
        in their illegal exactions. Seeing his child''s love of studying, the worthy
        father sent young James to the school, which, from its being in Hampshire,
        was the place of education for those Isle of Wight boys whose parents desired
        them to become, as the word then was, '' good scholars.'' The little Newport
        boy was placed on the foundation of William of Wykeham at Winchester College.
        There young James saw written up in the schoolroom the motto, '' Aut disce,
        aut discede, Manet sors tertia, caedi.'' Of the three alternatives, learning,
        expulsion, or a severe flogging, the Newport lad wisely selected the first.
        He stuck to his books, but as '' all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy

        whose well known name appears in the calendar of our present Prayer Book among
        the so-called black-letter saints on the 15th day of July. Saint Swithun,
        so Wheatley in his book on The Common Prayer says, was .first a monk and afterwards
        a prior of the convent of Winchester. Upon the death of Helmsham, bishop of
        that see, by the favour of King Ethel wulf, the son of King Egbert, he was
        promoted to succeed him in that bishopric, a.d. 832, and continued in it eleven
        years, to his death. '' The chief guide of Ethelwulf,'' says Professor Henry
        Morley (English Writers, vol. ii. pp. 265 266), ''in arts of peace was Swithun,
        a monk df Winchester, who was ordained priest in the year 830, and whose repute
        for learning had caused Egbert to commit to him the instruc tion of his son.
        It was by Swithun''s advice that in 853 Ethelwulf sent his youngest son Alfred,
        then only five years old, to Rome with a large retinue including perhaps Swithun
        himself. Two years afterwards, having by Swithun''s advice given a tenth of
        his kingdom to the Church, Ethelwulf went to Rome himself with his son Alfred,
        taking magnificent gifts, and ordaining from his private property a perpetual
        annuity to Rome which was the foundation of the claim of " Peter''s pence."
        '' In a later portion of the same volume (pp. 301-304) Professor Morley has
        given a most interesting account of a lately published Anglo-Saxon fragment
        of a string of legends ''setting forth why Ethelwold, having translated the
        bones of Swithun, dedicated to him the new minster, which remained dedicated
        to that saint uniil Henry VIII ordered the name of the Holy Trinity to be
        substituted. Used as waste parchment at the beginning of the sixteenth century
        in binding a register for the Chapter Library at Gloucester, six leaves of
        a tenth-century manuscript were set aside more than six years ago by a minor
        canon and a librarian, to be shown to Mr. Sharon Turner, when he came, as
        he did once a year, that way. They were pronounced by him to be portions of
        an Anglo-Saxon homily or homilies. The leaves were put aside and lost for
        a time, but redis covered in loose leaves in a thin portfolio when, in 1860,
        the British Association met at Gloucester. They were then examined and described

        allowed him. He betook himself to the laborious search required for the study
        of ancient MSS., and could tell in what age any one was written by a bare
        inspection of the character. Such knowledge is rare, and is most valuable
        for any one who has charge of a public library. To decipher a manu script,
        not to speak of a palimpsest, is the work of laborious days and nights. The
        library, which had been bequeathed by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, Governor
        of the Isle of Wight, and Captain of Carisbrooke Castle, to the Uni versity
        of Oxford, had been dispersed in the general havoc made under Edward VI. Mr.
        (afterwards Sir Thomas) Bodley, a diplomatist employed by Queen Elizabeth,
        finding on his return from foreign parts that his advancement at Court was
        obstructed by the jealousies and intrigues of the great men, retired from
        Court and from all public business in 1597, and set about his noble work of
        restoring, or rather founding anew, the public library at Oxford, which was
        completed in 1599. Bodley saw that in making James his first Bodleian librarian
        he was choosing the right man for the right place. The vigilant curiosity
        of Tom Hearne, the antiquary, col lected the singular correspondence of the
        founder of the Bodleian Library with Dr. James, and published it under the
        title of Reliquiae Bodleianae, or some genuine remains of Sir Thomas Bodley,
        1703, 8vo. Of this book the elder D''lsraeli, in his Curiosities of Literature,
        vol. ii. pp. 299-301, gives some account. In his ardour for the general interests
        of his library Bodley resolutely insisted that his librarian should persevere
        in lone fellowship, for '' marriage,'' opined the sounder of the Bodleian
        Library, '' is too full of domestic impeachments to afford him so much time
        from his private affairs.'' The doctor decided against celibacy for a librarian,
        and was gravely admonished on the absurdity of such con duct in one who had
        the care of a public library, '' for it was the opening of a gap to disorder
        hereafter/ When James I was preparing a visit to the library, Bodley, who
        had been knighted by the king, furnished hints to his librarian for his speech

        In 1625, the year in which Charles I ascended the throne and married Henrietta
        Maria, the Parliament, which met in June, was removed to Oxford on account
        of the plague then raging in London. In all the jubilation of a royal coronation
        and wedding, along with the excitement of a Parliament sitting in the University
        town, the authorities were not much disposed towards the prosecution of theological
        or historical research. Dr. James therefore determined to do what he could
        in this matter by himself. He had in 1620 resigned his office in the Bodleian,
        in order that he might have more time for his studies, the chief object of
        which was the defence of the Protestant faith against its Roman Catholic antagonists.
        He died however in 1629, at the age of fifty-one, being able to carry his
        project into effect, '' Leaving behind him,'' says his biographer, '' this
        character, that he was the most in dustrious and indefatigable writer against
        Popery that had been educated at Oxford since the Reformation.'' Dr. James
        was no mere bookworm, but a worshipper at the altar of sacred truth, throwing
        himself heart and soul into that controversy between Protestantism and Romanism
        which, after all the weary battles between these two con tending principles
        that date from the sixteenth century, has not yet come to a close. Religious
        controversy on the points which divide Christians from one another is not
        a wholesome discipline for the intellect, nor for that calm judicial temper
        at which God-fearing and thoughtful men should aim. Dr. James entered upon
        it by relying on that research into Christian antiquity which, along with
        the reverent study of Holy Scripture, and of those laws of development which
        regulate the manifestations of the spirit of Christianity as they are presented
        to us at each age, gives us the hope that, under the advancing light of Gospel
        truth, principles seemingly hostile will be reconciled, not by superficial
        agree ments or hollow compromises, but through a fuller discovery of that
        which is involved in each of them. In that better mansion to which this painstaking
        student has been removed we may have faith that a task has been assigned by

        substance in the borough of Newport. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth the
        condition of Newport, as of the whole of the Isle of Wight, was so deplorable
        that in the year 1559 a commission was appointed under Sir Francis Knollys
        to investigate the cause of this distress, and to suggest a remedy. The answers
        prepared by the authorities of Newport to the thirteen questions submitted
        by the commissioners, one of the four returns which are still preserved in
        the State Paper Office, furnish a complete roll of the burgesses of Newport
        at that date. Among these is found the name of Richard James, '' who holdeth
        frely ii messuags the yerely rente xlvjs. John Jamys holdeth freely iiij messuags
        rente iijl. iijs. ixd.'' To our modern notions these rents appear small, but
        on comparing them with those held by other burgesses in this presentation
        Richard and John James are among the wealthiest of the* citizens of Newport.
        The word spelt messuag is of course '' messuage,'' a word of common use in
        legal instruments of conveyance, an old word from '' mes,'' i. e. '' mansus,''
        a manse or mansion. Not only were they citizens of substance, they were held
        in such esteem by their fellow-burgesses that a Richard Jeames, who, it may
        be inferred, belonged to the Isle of Wight family of James, is found as representative
        for Newport, I. W., alias Medina Borough, in the last Parliament of Queen
        Elizabeth in 1601. Though the return is defaced, this same Richard James was
