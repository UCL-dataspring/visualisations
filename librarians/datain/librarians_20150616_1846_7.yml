        \ the horizon, because when we are ex acly on the equator both poles appear\
        \ on thc horizon. There is, however, no star ex actly in either of the celestial\
        \ poles ; therefore, to find the altitude of that invisible point called the\
        \ pole ofthe heavens, we must choose some star near it that docs not set;\
        \ and having, by several observations, found its greatest and least altitudes,\
        \ divide their difference by two, and half that difference added to the least,\
        \ and substracted from the greatest alti tude of the star, gives the exact\
        \ altitude of the pole, or latitude of the place Thus sup posing the greatest\
        \ altitude of the star observed is 60\xB0, and its least 50\xB0, we know that\
        \ the latitude of the place where the observation was made is exactly 55'.\
        \ As there are 90 degrees of latitude from the equator to either of the poles,\
        \ so four times this number, or 360 , must necessarily comprehend the whole\
        \ circumference of the earth. If therefore one degree be accurately measured,\
        \ the magnitude of the whole ter raqueous globe may be nearly ascertained.\
        \ This method will approach just as near to accuracy as the figure of the\
        \ world we inhabit docs to a perfect sphere. On this prin ciple it is that\
        \ several attempts have been made, in different a_;cs, to ascertain the mag\
        \ nitude of the earth. Eratosthenes, the librarian of Ptolemy Evergetcs, is\
        \ among the most celebrated of the antienl astronomers who laboured for the\
        \ solution of this noble problem. Having observed that, on the day of the\
        \ summer solstice, the sun passed through the vertical point ofthe city Syenne,\
        \ he caused a well to be dug there, in such a situation, that at twelve o'clock,\
        \ on the fore- mentioned clay, it should be wholly enlight ened by the solar\
        \ rays. He also placed in the city of Alexandria a concave hemisphere, with\
        \ a post in its centre. Remarking, on the appointed day, at the instant of\
        \ noon, the distance of the sun from thc vertical point by the shadow of this\
        \ post, he found, that at the time when thc sun was vertical to the city of\
        \ Syenne, it wanted one-fiftieth part of a whole circle to be so at Alexandria.\
        \ From this observation he naturally concluded that the city of Alexandria\
        \ must be one-fiftieth part of the whole cheumference ofthe earth distant\
        \ from Syenne. The distance between these two cities was easily measured,\
        \ and when ascertained, he multiplied it by 50, and thus discovered that thc\
        \ whole earth was 250,000 furlongs in circumference, as 5,000 furlongs was\
        \ the distance from one of these stations of observation to the other. Posidonius\
        \ next after him set upon this business, who, from his enquiry, found that\
        \ 70,000 furlongs were to be cut off from the computation of Eratoshenes,\
        \ and affirmed that the compass of the earth is 180,000 furlongs. This measure\
        \ was received and used by Ptolemy and other geographers after him for^a long\
        \ time, nor is it, as will appear from what follows, very wide of the truth.\
        \ In the ninth century, Al Mamun, kalis of Arabia, employed certain eminent\
        \ mathematicians to measure a degree in the fields of Mesopotamia. Thc result\
        \ of their research was, that a little more than 20,000 miles were attributed\
        \ to the circumference of the earth. Long after all these, Snellius, an Hollander,\
        \ from a more exact scrutiny, demonstrated 24,000 miles were to be ascribed\
        \ to this earth. Thus we are come at length, to the Inst measures of the English\
        \ and French, which were deter mined by the most accurate-methods that ever\
        \ were, or perhaps ever will be put in prac tice. Our countryman, Norwood,\

        where I then lived, my Political Discourses, the only work of mine that was
        successful on the first publication. It was well received abroad and at home.
        In the same year was published at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles

        is of all my writings, historical, philoso phical, or literary, incomparably
        the best. It came unnoticed and unobserved into the world. In 1752 the Faculty
        of Advocates chose me . their Librarian, an office from which I received little
        or no emolument, but which gave me the . command of a large library. I then
        formed the plan of writing the History of England ; but be- . ing frightened
        with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of 1700 years,

        the misrepresentations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I .

        near London: But Selden, apprehensive of the loss, engaged his friend Whitlocke,
        then lord keeper for the commonwealth, to apply for the office of librarian.
        This expedient saved that va luable collection. It is, however, remarkable,

        vio lent measures of the party. This was John Milton, whose poems are admirable,
        though liable to some objections ; his prose Avritings disagreeable, though
        not altogether defective in genius. Nor are all his poems equal : His Paradise
        Lost, his Comus, and a few others, shine out amidst some flat and insipid

        can enter into human conception; others Avould have required the most laboured
        ele gance of composition to support them. It is cer tain, that this author,

        who undoubtedly made the clock in question. The librarian shewed me, as a
        favor, an ancient manuscript Bible, dated in the year 10 16; also a Romish
        prayer-book, of 1060, which are esteemed great curiosities. The museum is
        a striking instance of the persevering industry of an individual, Avhile the
        grant of the Old State-House for its exhibition does honor to the city. The
        proprietor is Mr. Charles W. Peale, by profession a painter, which he relinquished,
        and became a virtuoso. He says " that in the year 1785, he began his collections
        with some bones of the mammoth, and the paddle-fish, hereafter described ;
        and that in the year 1802, the legislature of Pennsylvania, influenced by
        the idea of its increasing utility, granted the upper part of the State- House
        for the use of the Museum." Considering the short time since this collection
        Avas commenced, it is surprising to find such a number of natural curiosities
        in this Museum. The paddle-fish, which Mr. Peale observes was one ofthe first
        articles, and from Avhich he probably conceived the idea of making the collection.
        is four feet and four inches in length. The snout resembles in shape the paddle
        used by Indians in crossing rivers, and is eighteen inches long. This fish
        is an object of curiosity from its being caught in the Allegany River, and
        State of Ohio, many hundred miles from the sea. The fossils Avere chiefly
        collected in England, and make a handsome appearance, from the judicious manner
        in Avhich they are disposed. Several were found near Christchurch, in Hampshire,
        se\''enty feet from the surface of the earth ; and near them is placed a shark''s

        this liberal en dowment. On informing him of my intention of publishing my
        obser vations, he AA''as very assiduous in communicating Avhatever respected
        the origin and progress ofthe institution. The foundation of this library
        was laid in the year 1731, a period Avhen Philadelphia afforded little assistance
        to the enquiries of the stu dious. A number of gentlemen having raised the
        sum of one hundred pounds by subscription, a small library Avas founded upon
        principles the best calculated to disseminate knowledge; the books were not,
        as in many public libraries of Europe, confined to the apartments, but the
        sub scribers were alloAved. to carry them home for a reasonable space of time.
        The plan soon became popular ; additions '' to the number of mem bers took
        place, and the stock of books Avas annually encreased by pur chases at the
        company''s expence, and liberal donations from persons both at home and abroad.
        The then proprietors of Pennsylvania ap pear to have taken a patriotic pleasure
        in the encouragement ofthe plan. Besides several valuable donations, they
        granted a charter of incorpora tion in the year 1724. A spirit of literary
        improvement made its vrajr among all classes of people, and the philanthropy
        of that great and amiable character, Doc tor Franklin, Avho suggested the
        plan, was gratified by tracing the books as well into the hands ofthe opulent,
        Avith Avhom literature is sometimes no more than one of the ornaments of civil
        life, as of those to whom it renders a more substantial benefit. Letters,
        while they employ the lei sure of the artist, reconcile him to his labor;
        by removing grosser re laxations, they promote his health, Avhile they enlarge
        his mind : and prolong his life, while they teach him to enjoy it. The great
        utility and success of this measure occasioned the formation of other libraries

        full fifty years, enjoyed more pleasure from the questions of a Duns Scotus
        than the effusions of Tally, received the books coldly, cast them carelessly
        into a corner, and then ordered his chamberlain to give the author a sum by
        way of remuneration, which scarcely reimbursed him for the money he had expended
        in purchasing the parchment whereon his work was written. " Fool that I was,"
        exclaimed the Greek in his own tongue, " to think that such an ass had a relish

        Pope knew nothing of the Greek language. (I) I shall now wind up my annotations

        town or city where they reside. A visiting committee, consisting of three
        go vernors, determines concerning the continuance of the patients in the hospital,
        and has the general care of the institution. The officers are a president,
        vice-president, treasurer, and secretary ; six physicians, four surgeons,
        a superintendent, who is also the steward ; a house physician, who is also
        the librarian; a house surgeon, an apothecary, and a clerk. An asylum for
        lunatics is annexed to this institution. A ward also is appropriated for the
        reception of lying-in women. Since the year 1799, sick and disabled seamen,
        at the port of New-York, are received into the Hospital, and enjoy all its
        advantages. From the year 1804, the collector of the port has refused to pay
        for more than seventy-five seamen at a time. From motives of humanity, and
        a general regard to this useful class of men, the governors have, nevertheless,
        during five years, beginning with 1806, admitted eight hundred and forty-three
        seamen beyond the number paid for by the collector, or, in other words, by
        the national government, and have thus incurred an expense of 9,500 dollars,
        a fact honour able to the governors of the hospital, but far otherwise to
        those of the nation. The whole number of patients admitted into this institution,
        from 1792 to 1810 inclusive, was 13,863. Of these, 9,227 have been cured,
        886 relieved, 646 discharged at the request of friends, 458 dismissed as disorderly,
        187 sent to the alms house, 517 eloped, and 1,676 have died. When it is remem
        bered, that but few apply until their diseases are far advanced, and that
        many are brought in a hopeless condition, this account will, it is believed,
        be thought very favourable to the character of the institution. From the year
        1797 to 1810 inclusive, the number of patients was 13,035. Of these, 77 were
        natives of Asia; 134 of Africa ; 6,036 of Europe ; and 6,788 of America. Of
        the Europeans, 1,129 were Englishmen ; 427 Scotchmen ; 3,164 Irishmen. Often
        the native place was unknown. The number of lunatics admitted into the asylum
        in five years wap 362, of whom 150 were cured. The library belonging to this
        institution is valuable. The', 1]

        himself in writing Latin verse ; but I sincerely wish, that the knowledge
        of the ancient languages was now holden in similar estimation. The terms of
        admission, and the mode of education, in this seminary, differ, immaterially,
        from those in Yale college, which have been already mentioned. Here the leaning
        is towards the languages, in Yale college towards the arts and sciences. In
        the year 1642, the general court constituted a board of overseers for Harvard

        colony, and of the teaching elders of Cambridge, Watertown, Charlestown, Bos
        ton, Roxbury, and Dorchester, together with the president. In 1650, the first
        charter was granted by the general court, which constituted a corporation,
        consisting of the president, five fellows, and the treasurer ; by the style
        of the President and Fellows of Harvard College. Beside other important powers,
        this body has the superintendence of all the collegiate property. Of these
        two bodies the academical legislature was formed . By the present constitution

        governor, lieu tenant-governor, council, aud senate of the state, and the
        congregational ministers of the above-mentioned towns, were declared the future
        overseers. By this constitution, also, the style of " The University in Cambridge"
        was first legally given. The corporation fills all vacancies in its own body,
        and elects all executive officers. But these elections, together with their
        laws, and their votes concerning salaries and de grees, must be presented
        to the board of overseers for their concurrence. The executive officers are

        were politely conducted over it. The building now called the palace, was formerly
        the Hotel de Ville, in which were accommodated the various tribunals and public
        officers of the city. The late king, Louis Bonaparte, having resolved to make
        Amsterdam the seat of government, that he might more effectually lend his
        protection to commerce, chose this edifice for the royal residence, and in
        April, 1808, it was prepared and furnished for his re ception. When the government
        was abandoned by Louis, and Holland became united to France, Na poleon deigned
        to receive this edifice among the number of his imperial palaces, and in 1811
        it was occupied by him and Maria Louisa during their visit to the Dutch departments

        Since that time, the library has no doubt received considerable additions.
        Indeed Professor Molbech, who, from having been employed as an under librarian
        for nearly twenty years, must be supposed to speak authoritatively upon the
        subject, has stated the number of books to be consider ably upwards of 300,000
        volumes in the year 1816. f Besides being entitled to two copies (one of them
        on large paper) of every work printed in the Danish dominions, the library
        receives an annual allowance of about L. 1000 Sterling from government for
        the acquisi tion of works published abroad, out of which sum, however, the

        men of extensive erudition and highly cultivated taste, had, it seems, eagerly
        seized the opportunity of displaying the most valuable stores of the Danish

        of his country ! It was my wish to have conducted Belzoni to Count Moltke''s
        noble gallery of paintings, and to some other public and private collections
        ; but that was impossible. After a stroll in the Botanic Garden, I therefore
        took him to the Round Tower, an object of great curiosity in itself, but too
        well known to need description. It com mands a fine view of Copenhagen and
        its environs. But the view is now much deteriorated, by traces of the bombardment,
        still visible within and without the city. Contiguous to the Round Tower is
        the University Library, in which a Museum of Northern Antiquities has been

        importance, as un questionably much depends on the qualifications and exer
        tions of the individual who may hold it; and if we consider his extensive

        the management of the royal library have been en trusted. He is indeed generally
        esteemed as one of the most learned men in Denmark ; and his peculiar fitness
        for the situation which he has now for so many years held, is best exemplified,
        as well in the prosperous manner in which the library has increased, as in
        its management, a liberal spirit of accommodation being always evinced, and

        written, and for this reason, as well as for that of enabling the librarian
        to take them out and put them in again with greater facility, the books are
        placed with the edges outwards. Amongst the curiosities of this library is
        preserved with much care a large folio volume, in which the four Gospels,
        and certain productions of the holy fathers, are written in letters of gold.
        It was commenced by direction of the Emperor Con rad, and finished in the
        time of his son, Henry II. , and is, therefore, at least seven hundred and
        eighty, years old ; yet the letters appear as fresh as if they were recently
        executed. The pages are beautifully illuminated. Another curious volume is
        also shown, which contains the Apocalypse ex quisitely written. At the beginning
        of each chapter there is an illuminated representation of its contents. Over
        this library there is another apartment equally exten sive, which is chiefly
        appropriated to manuscripts in Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, Latin, and other languages.
        Amongst these are several very ancient Bibles in different languages, particularly
        a Greek copy a little injured, which belonged to the Emperor Cantacuene, and
        is said to agree very closely with that of the seven interpreters. Not the
        least curious of these trea sures is an Alcoran. The total number of the manuscripts
        is at present estimated at four thousand; and of printed books, in both libraries,
        at twenty-four thousand. Their number was at one time considerably greater,
        but several of the former were consumed in a destructive fire which oc curred

        some knowledge of the sciences, and was an able logician and mathematician
        ; but that he was of an arrogant dis position, a weak reasoner, and poor theologian
        ; however this opinion should be considered as the effect of preju dice and
        of party spirit, as Malmesbury, Hoveden, and others, represent him to have
        been possessed of great pe netration, and universal knowledge in learning
        ; and that Anastasius the librarian, his contemporary, in his letter, 23d

        sanctity, and that he ascribes to the special influence of the spirit of God,

        such a work could have been written by a barbarian (this epithet is unfit)
        of Scotia, situated at the extremity of the earth, without the special aid

        country of John Erigena, because his con temporaries called him Scotus ; which,
        however, was the general name of the Irish in that century ; Erigena signifies
        indeed a native of Erin, which is the real name of Ireland ; as Angligena
        signifies an Englishman, and Francigena a Frenchman. When we consider the
        advantages which the Scoto-Mi lesians enjoyed with respect to religion and
        the sciences, in the first ages of Christianity, could we suppose them not
        to have possessed, likewise, cultivated minds and polished manners? The sciences
        which enlighten and ornament the understanding, flourished amongst them more
        than in any other nation. That Christian morality which regulates the motions
        of the heart, formed men among them who were celebrated for the sanctity of
        their morals. Notwithstanding these advantages, an astonish ing mixture of

        said to have burned a heap of their books ; and in Ireland, St. Patrick was
        no less severe, committing, according to the Leccan records, no less than
        180 tracts to the flames. The assertion so often repeated in the Ossianic
        controversy, that no Gaelic MSS. were in existence, was generally believed
        until the investigations of the Highland Society proved its falsity. If the
        reader consult the last Chapter of this work, he will be satisfied that the
        Scots had the use of letters in the most early ages ; but as it seems here
        necessary, to shew what reliance may be placed on the statements which are
        subsequently introduced, and to vindicate the authenticity of several of the
        authorities which it has been necessary to quote, some account of the early
        state of literature in the British Isles shall be given. The Bards occasionally
        wrote in the first ages of Chris tianity, but we are told they did not make
        it a practice to commit their poems to literary record before the fifth cen
        tury, and the distractions which so long afflicted the coun try occasioned
        the loss, either by destruction or removal, of most of their productions ;
        and hence Gildas, who wrote in the middle of the sixth century, for want of
        those " records left by his own countrymen, which were either destroyed by
        the enemy at home, or carried by exiles into other parts," was obliged to
        apply for the most part to foreign writers. Nennius, who flourished in 858,
        tells us he com piled his history " from the Roman annals, the chronicles
        of the holy fathers, and the writings of the Scots and Eng lish ; also from
        the traditions of the elders, which, by many learned men and librarians, had
        been reduced to writing, hut either from frequent deaths, or the devastations
        of war, were then left in a decayed and confused condition." The remains of

        Mr. Brewer, the Register of the Land Office, Mr. Pearce, the late Clerk of
        the House of Delegates, and Mr. Murray, the late Clerk ofthe Council. To his
        friend, Mr. Jonas Green, of Annapolis, he is indebted, as the reader will
        perceive, for some of the most valuable information which this work embodies;
        informa- tion furnished with that peculiar kindness of manner, which strives
        to break the weight of obligation, by seeming rather to be the receiver than
        the giver of favors. To Mr. James Carroll, and Mr. Fielding Lucas, Jun., of
        Baltimore, he is indebted for several rare works, which he had occasion to
        consult in the course of his researches : and Mr. Carroll also kindly submitted,
        for his perusal, some very interest- ing memoranda, of hisown collection,
        in reference to the Provincial Government. Mr. Horatio Ridout of Anne Arundel,
        as soon as he was apprised of the writer''s inten- tions, transmitted to him
        a record of all the correspondence of Governor Sharpe, during his long administration
        of this Province. This record was made by the father of Mr. Ri- dout, the
        acting Secretary of Governor Sharpe, and is full of interesting details, relative
        to the internal polity of this Province, and the operations of the colonies

        of some of its most interesting portions, in the succeeding volume. None but

        such attentions are ; and none but the ungrate ful can fail to remember, and

        by the late James Logan, a gen tleman of considerable literature, who in the
        course of a long life had collected a number of the most rare and curious
        books in almost all the ancient languag es. He built a house for their reception,
        and by deed executed in his life time, vested the house and lot, together
        with the books and some yearly rents for supporting a librarian, and occasionally
        increasing the catalogue, in trustees for the use of the public for ever ;
        under certain rules and regulations con tained in these instruments. Sometime
        afterwards he cancelled this deed, and prepared another, which he did not
        live to execute ; this unfinished instru ment varied the regulations in some
        respects, and the funds for the purpose of the institution, but the uses were

        to the interests of literature, to be possessed of one large, than of several

        till the Amicable, the Association, and the Union Compa nies were blended
        with " the Library Company of Philadelphia," the title conferred by the charter.
        Since this event, which took place in the year 1769, the members and the property
        of the company have continued to increase ; the former being now between five
        and six hundred in number. The num ber of volumes, at present, amounts to
        twenty thou sand and seventy-six; the selection of which, has in general been
        calculated to promote the more im portant interests of society. The stock
        of books is continually increased by occasional donations, an nual importations,
        and purchases of every Ameri can production of merit. The library received,
        a few years since, a consi derable accession of very valuable and costly books,
        to the number of two thousand five hundred vo lumes, by the bequest of the
        late Rev. Mr. Preston, rector of Chevening, in Kent, England. Some valuable

        conformable to that which had been prepared by him, vesting in the same trustees
        the whole estate intended by the founder, and the books were removed to a
        building prepared for them, arranged in order, and a catalogue printed. By
        the constitution, William Logan (the founder''s eldest son) was the first
        librarian, and the office was made hereditary in his family, with power to
        execute it by a deputy. The funds appointed for a librarian, &c. were originally
        small, but issued from a very improving estate ; they were so reserved as
        to in crease at stated periods, so as to afford a very hand some income. Till
        one of those periods arrived they were not sufficient for the regular support
        of a libra rian, wherefore he attended a considerable time to the duty in

        library, col lected partly by himself, and partly by his uncle, the late Dr.
        William Logan, of Bristol, in England, amounting to about one thousand volumes.
        After his death, which happened in 1776, the library was shut for several
        years, owing to the death or absence oi the trustees. In 1791, James Logan,
        the last surviving trustee named in the grant, having had several pre vious
        consultations with Dr. Franklin, and with a number of his fellow citizens,
        on the subject, pre sented a memorial to the legislature, wherein he stated
        the situation of the institution, and prayed for their aid to put it in a
        way of answering the end in tended by his father, the founder. Whereupon,
        an act was passed, annexing the Loganian library to that of the Library Company
        of Philadelphia, and constitu ting the directors and their successors, for
        the time being, together with James Logan, or his eldest male heir and two

        The house built by James Logan, has been sold, and a large and commodious
        room built adjoining the Philadelphia Library, for the purpose of keeping

        who gives his attendance on the afternoon of every seventh day (Saturday)
        for the delivery and receipt of books, free of expense, to any respectable
        applicant who shall subscribe to the rules. A convenient room in the meeting
        house on Mul berry and Fourth streets, is appropriated as a repo sitory for
        the books. This collection was originally commenced by the pious Thomas Chalkley,

        \ to be partly built of stones taken from the ancient Pagan temple. The flags\
        \ of the aisle are said to be marked with Runic characters, but we did not\
        \ happen to light on any. At each side of the communion-table are a white\

        \ and his successors, lords of Fife, should place the crown on the king s\
        \ head at his coronation ; secondly, that they should lead the vanguard of\
        \ the army whenever the royal banner was displayed ; and, lastly, this privilege\
        \ of clan Macduff whereby any person, being related to Macduff within the\
        \ ninth degree, and having committed homi cide:in ckaude melle (without premeditation),\
        \ should, upon flying to Macduff's Cross and paying a certain fine, obtain\
        \ remission of their guilt. Such, at least, is the account given of the law\
        \ by all our historians. Nevertheless, there seems ground to suspect that\
        \ the privilege did not amount to an actual and total remission of the crime,\
        \ but only to a right of being exempted from all other courts of jurisdiction,\
        \ except that ofthe lord of Fife. The reader is presented with an old document,\
        \ in which the law of clan Macduff is pleaded on behalf of one ofthe ancesters\
        \ of Moray of Abercairney ; and it is remarkable that he does not claim any\
        \ immunity, but solely a right of being repledged, because his cause had already\
        \ been tried byRobert earl of Fife, the sole competent judge. But the privilege\
        \ of being answerable only to the chief of their own clan was, to the descendants\
        \ of Macduff, almost equivalent to an absolute in demnity. MacdufFs Cross\
        \ was situated near Lindores, on the march dividing Fife from Strathern. The\
        \ form of this venerable monument unfortunately offended the zeal of the reformer,\
        \ Knox, and it was totally demolished by his followers. The pedestal, a solid\
        \ block of stone, alone escaped the besom of destruction. It bore an inscription,\
        \ which, according to the apocryphal account of sir Robert Sibbald, was a\
        \ mixture of Latin, Saxon, Danish, and old French. Skene has preserved two\
        \ lines : \" Propter Makgridim et hoc oblatum, Accipe Smeleridem super lampade\
        \ limpid\xE6 labrum \" Skene, de verb. sig. voce Clan Macduff. The full inscription,\
        \ real or pretended, may be found in sir Robert Sibbald's \" History of Fife,\"\
        \ and in James Cunninghame's \" Essay upon MacdufFs Cross,\" together with\
        \ what is called a translation, or rather paraphrase, of the piebald jargon\
        \ which composes it. In Gough's edition of Camden's Britannia, a different\
        \ and more intelligible version is given, on the authority of a Mr. Douglas\
        \ of Newburgh. The cross was dedicated to a St. Macgider. Around the pedestal\
        \ are tumuli, said to be the graves of those who, having claimed the privi_\
        \ lege of the law, failed in proving their consanguinity to the Thane of Fife.\
        \ Such persons were instantly executed. The people of Newburgh believe that\
        \ the spectres of these criminals still haunt the ruined cross, and claim\
        \ that mercy for their souls which they had failed to obtain for their mortal\
        \ existence. The late lord Hailes gives it as his opinion, that the indulgence\
        \ was only to last till the tenth generation from Macduff. Fordun and Wintoun\
        \ state, that the sine, to be paid by the person taking sanctuary, was twenty-four\
        \ merks for a gentleman, and twelve merks for a yeoman. Skene affirms it to\
        \ be nine cows, and a colpindach (/. e. a quey, or cow, of one or two years\
        \ old). \u2014 Fordun, lib. v. cap. q ; Wintoun s Cronykel, b. vi. cap. 18\

        also indebted to the State Librarian of Michigan and the Secretary of Stale,
        for facilitating my labors in their own re spective departments. Independently
        of the interest which has been for some time thickening around the Lake region
        of the country, from the progress of emigration into that quarter and its
        ex traordinary advance, there are also other facts which aug ment this interest.
        In the first place it has been excluded from the possession of the United
        States until the year 1796, and, by consequence, its history is foreign previous
        to that date. Held by the French crown until 1760, it was made a rallying
        point for its military and mercantile operations until this period, connected
        as they were with savages and the in fluence of French institutions and the
        Catholic Church. It is, moreover, a new and comparatively unknown field. While
        in the more densely settled States of the east the pro minent events of their
        growth have been carefully treasured up and recorded, those of the north-west
        have been in a great measure neglected. This is doubtless owing to the fact,
        that the region which now comprises the American States in this quarter had
        no distinct and independent government un til the year 1787. It was a howling
        wilderness, the border of a vast jurisdiction belonging to monarchies abroad
        ; inhabited by migratory traders, wandering hordes of savages, or tempo rary
        armies encamped for the purposes of defence or conquest. But the time has
        now arrived when the facts should be em bodied, and the causes and consequences
        which have borne upon that country clearly set forth. There is a striking
        difference in the colonial character of the Atlantic States and those of the
        north-west. The colo nial structure ofthe States of New England and New-York
        was of the English and Dutch cast ; while that of Michigan, previous to its
        conquest by England, was French. The iron independence, the upright, sober,
        and self-denying character of the founders of New England, chastening their
        appetites and passions to a severe form of religious doctrine, was un like
        that of the class of Frenchmen, who were inspired with', 1]

        \ by their foUowers. The pictures they had brought were then suspended in\
        \ the churches, and regarded as the most precious reUcs. Many of them, preserved\
        \ now in Russia, are considered as having the power of working miracles. It\
        \ would then necessarily follow, that with new preachers, new pictures must\
        \ be required. The Russians, charac terised at this day by a talent of imitation,\
        \ though with out a spark of inventive genius, followed, not only the style\
        \ of the original painting, but the manner of laying it on, and the materials\
        \ on which it was placed. Thus we find, at the end of the eighteenth century,\
        \ a Russian peasant placing before his Bogh a picture, purchased in the markets\
        \ of Moscow and Petersburg, exactly simi lar to those brought from Greece\
        \ during the tenth ; the same stiff representation of figures which the Greeks\
        \ themselves seem to have originally copied from works in mosaic, the same\
        \ mode of mixing and laying on the colours on a plain gold surface, the same\
        \ custom of painting upon wood, and the same expensive covering of a sdver\
        \ coat of mail ; when, from the multitude and cheapness of such pictures,\
        \ the precaution at first used to preserve them is no longer necessary. In\
        \ other instances of their religion, the copy of sacred relics seems to the\
        \ Russians as much an object of worship as the original. This will appear\
        \ by the description of Moscow, in the neighbourhood of which city is a build\
        \ ing erected at prodigious expense, in imitation of the Church of the Holy\
        \ Sepulchre at Jerusalem ; having exactly the same form, and containing a\

        \ and two stories high. The walls and pilasters of another apartment were\
        \ ornamented with lapis lazuli, as well as the tables it contained. The Ca\
        \ binet of Mirrors is a small room lined with large pier glasses, looking\
        \ upon a terrace, near which is a covered gallery above 260 feet long. There\
        \ are various statues about the house and gardens, in marble and in bronze,\
        \ all without merit. The chapel is entirely of gilded wood, and very richly\
        \ ornamented. A small flower garden leads to the bath, which is ornamented\
        \ with jasper, agates, and statuesand columns of marble. The grotto is also\
        \ adorned in the same way with a number of beautiful products of the mineral\
        \ kingdom, wrought into columns, busts, bas-rehefs, vases, &c. ; among others,\
        \ a vase composed of the precious stones of Siberia. From this grotto is seen\
        \ a lake, on which appears the rostral column to Orlof, which the empress\
        \ erected in honour of the naval victory he ob tained over the Turks at Tchesme.\
        \ The Cathedral of Novogorod, dedicated to St Sophia, in imitation of the\
        \ name given to the magnificent edifice erected by Justinian at Constantinople,\
        \ was budt in the eleventh century.* Many of the pictures seem to have been\
        \ there from the time in which the church was finished, aud doubtless were\
        \ some of them painted long before its consecration, if they were not brought\
        \ into the country with the introduction of Christianity. At any rate, we\
        \ may consider them as having originated from the source whence Italy derived\
        \ a knowledge of the art, though prior to its appearance iu that country.\
        \ Little can be said of the merit of any of them. They are more remarkable\
        \ for singularity than beauty. In the dome of a sort of ante-chapel, as you\
        \ enter, are seen the representations of monsters with many heads ; aud such\
        \ a strange assemblage of imaginary beings, that it might be supposed a pagan\
        \ rather than a Christian temple. The different representations of the Virgin,\
        \ throughout Russia, will show to what a pitch of ab surdity superstition\
        \ has been carried. I believe most of them arc found in all their principal\
        \ churches, and their worship forms a conspicuous feature in the man ners\
        \ of the Russians ;+ but though they are all objects of adoration, they have\
        \ each of them particular places, in which as tutelary deities they obtain\
        \ more peculiar reverence ; and sometimes small chapels and churches, dedicated\
        \ particularly to some one of them individually. These are, principally, the\
        \ Virgin of Vladimir ; the Vir gin with the Bleeding Cheek ; and \u2014 spcclalum\
        \ admissi, After we left Tsarskoselo, the snow diminished very fast, and our\
        \ fears of reaching Moscow on sledges in creased. But during the night, and\
        \ part of the morn ing of the 4th of April, it fell in such abundance, that\
        \ all trace of the roads disappeared, and we lost our way once or twice before\
        \ we arrived at Novogorod. The place was half buried hi snow, but we managed\
        \ to get to the cathedral, curious to see the collection of pictures, idols\
        \ of the Greek church, which that ancient buildiug contains ; and which, with\
        \ many others, dispersed in the cities and towns of Russia, were introduced\
        \ long before the art of painting was practised in Italy. The know ledge of\
        \ this circumstance led me to hope that I should make some very curious acquisitions\
        \ in the country : and upon my first arrival from the Swedish frontier, I\
        \ had given a few pounds to a Russian officer for his god, which consisted\
        \ of an oval plate of copper, on which the figure of a warrior was beautifully\
        \ painted on a gold ground. This warrior proved afterwards to be St Alex ander\
        \ Ncvski ; and as I advanced through the country to Petersburg, there was\
        \ hardly a hut, or a post-house, that did uot contain one or more paintings\
        \ upon small panels of wood ; the figures of which were represented, after\
        \ the manner of the earliest specimeus of the art, upon a gold ground, and\
        \ sometimes protected in front by a silver coat of mail, which left only the\
        \ faces and hands of the images visible. A small attention to the history\
        \ and character of the Russians will explain the cause. * [It is probable\
        \ that this cathedral is the oldest in Russia, as it was founded originally\
        \ by Vladimir the Great in 988. It was first built of stone or brick in 1051\
        \ or 1057 by Vladimir Yarosla vitch, Great Duke of Novogorod ; and, according\
        \ to the opinion of the best authorities, part of the original structure yet\
        \ remains, though it suffered considerably by fire in the year 1340. The form\
        \ of the church is in rude and humble imitation of Saint Sophia's at Constantinople,\
        \ being nearly square, though thrown into the form of a Greek cross by the\
        \ four piers which support the roof.] When the religion of the Greek church\
        \ was first in troduced into Russia, its propagators, prohibited by the second\
        \ commandment from the worship of carved images, brought with them the pictures\
        \ of the Saints, of the Virgin, and the Messiah. The earliest churches in\
        \ the Holy Land had paintings of this kind, which the first Christians worshipped\
        \ ; as may be proved by the re mains of them at this time in that country.*\
        \ To pro tect these holy symbols of the new faith from the rude but zealous\
        \ fingers and lips of its votaries, in a country where the arts of multiplying\
        \ them by imitation were then unknown, they were covered by plates of the\
        \ most precious metals, which left the features alone visible. As soon as\

        \ Mr Bremner, our most recent authority on this point, states, that in spite\
        \ of all restrictions, \" Russian litera ture is advancing with great rapidity.\"\
        \ In the Russian empire are published eighty papers and minor periodi cals,\
        \ and about twelve scientific and literary journals. This is something, certainly\
        \ ; but compare it with what is issued in any single one- of the states of\
        \ the North American Union. The fact is, there cannot be said to exist in\
        \ Russia a press at all, in the common acceptation of the term, for the newspapers\
        \ and political periodicals must necessarily be government organs. The jealous\
        \ vigilance of the censorship is particularly directed to English newspapers,\
        \ all but the Morning Post being strictly prohibited from entering the capital.\
        \ In 1837, the printing establishments in the empire amounted to 171, of which\
        \ 94 were maintained by government. There were also 74 lithographic establishments,\
        \ 9 of which were supported by the state. EDUCATION. A vast system of education\
        \ has been organised by the Russian government, which embraces the whole population\
        \ of the empire, down to the humblest serf. It is placed under the direct\
        \ and immediate control of the state, and is superintended by a ministry of\
        \ public instruction, the head of which is one of the principal officers of\
        \ the crown, like our secretary for the home department, the colonies, and\
        \ so on. The different branches of the administration also take special cognis\
        \ ance of the schools analogous to them. Thus the mili tary schools are presided\
        \ over by the war office, and the ecclesiastical schools by the holy synod.\
        \ The whole system is divided into four distinct parts : \u2014 1. The mini\
        \ stry of public instruction ; 2. Military schools ; 3. Ec clesiastical schools\
        \ ; and 4. Special and various schools. It is to the schools in the first\
        \ category that we shall pay particular attention, because they extend to\
        \ the masses of the people, and, properly speaking, constitute that part of\
        \ the system of national education by which the great body of the Russian\
        \ population is to be en lightened. The ministry of public instruction comprehends\
        \ edu- cation in public schools, which are discriminated into : 1. Parish\
        \ schools, intended for the lower orders of all kinds, but allowed to teach\
        \ only the catechism, reading, writing, and the first four rules of arithmetic.\
        \ 2. Dis trict schools, having three classes intended for the children of\
        \ shopkeepers, and restricted in their course of instruction to the catechism,\
        \ caligraphy, drawing, the first rudiments of grammar, arithmetic, geometry,\
        \ geography, and history. 3. Gymnasia distributed by government, and authorised\
        \ to embrace more elevated studies, but only accessible to the children of\
        \ the nobi lity. 4. Universities of three faculties, those of philo sophy,\
        \ jurisprudence, and medicine (Dorpat has also that of theology), and of which\
        \ the courses last five years. The following is a table of the state of the\
        \ schools in 1835, throughout the ten circuits of the Rus sian empire, exclusive\
        \ of Poland, which has a separate administration. .Another university has\
        \ lately been established at Vladimir in Volhynia, so that, with the university\
        \ of Warsaw, there will be nine institutions of this description throughout\
        \ the empire : \u2014 , Number of According to an official report of the minister\
        \ of public instruction, in 1837 the number of pupils had risen to 95,560.\
        \ The following table not only shows the present state of the universities,\
        \ but of the libra ries and scientific collections, and its introduction will\
        \ save much verbal description :\u2014 - The reader who examines the above\
        \ table, will no doubt be struck by the rather startling phenomenon, that\
        \ Kief, for instance, has a professor or master for every two pupils. But\
        \ we apprehend that librarians, conservators of museums, and other officials,\
        \ are in cluded under this head. The minister of public instruction further\
        \ superin tends education in private institutions, domestic educa tion, establishments\
        \ destined for forming professors and masters, and the academy of sciences,\
        \ the Russian aca demy, the other learned societies, the censorship, public\
        \ libraries, museums, and collections oj^hry description. Private and domestic\
        \ education ara(^0kled and ha rassed by restrictions, and even discouraged,\
        \ lest for bidden truths should be instilled into the youthful mind. For instance,\
        \ every teacher must have a diploma ; no books are allowed to be used except\
        \ such as are sanc tioned by government ; and no father even can choose a\
        \ tutor for his child except from amongst the ranks of the elected. There\
        \ is at St Petersburg an upper teachers' institution, a sort of normal school,\
        \ its object being the preparation of tutors for the gymnasia and lyceums\
        \ of the empire. It stands next in order to the universities, and has about\
        \ 150 pupils.1 The military schools are very widely distributed throughout\
        \ the empire, as might naturally be inferred ; and they absorb far too much\
        \ of the funds allotted to national education. The ecclesiastical schools\
        \ are also numerous, and divided into those of the Greek church, and those\
        \ of other forms of worship, both receiving aid from government. Let Britain\
        \ learn the fact, and blush. The special and various schools are too numerous\
        \ to be specified in detail. They are chiefly under different ministries corresponding\
        \ to their character, and com prise instruction in mining, technology, mercantile\
        \ marine, science of forests, agriculture, land surveying, commerce, medicine,\

        small, the number of works in any one department being probably insufficient

        at Necapatan, Mas sulipatam, and Petapoli, which lie on the Eastern or Coroman
        del coast. Whenever one of these winds has passed over the land, the people
        rise up and look round for their companions ; if any of them are seen to lie
        motionless, they are instantly laid hold of by a leg or an arm ; if this leaves
        the body the party is known to be dead, but if this does not happen, then
        it is certain that life is not extinct, although to all appearances the person
        looks like a corpse. On this they immediately cover the individual with clothes,
        and administer some warm diluting liquor to cause perspiration, which soon
        restores him. The sterile country of Arabia, besides this noxious wind, has
        some times a most pernicious air floating in its atmosphere, which affects
        the lungs and blood, and oftentimes burns, blisters and strips off the skin
        in a most surprising manner. This vapour is so injurious to the eyes, that,
        to avoid its effects, the Arabs are obliged to travel with a soft black crape
        over their face ; and as even this is not always a sufficient defence against
        its penetrating powers, they take care to provide themselves with an ointment
        of their own making, and which they know will be efficacious in time of need;
        with this they anoint their eyes whenever they begin to be inflamed. It is
        considered that the Samiel is the pestilence of the ancients so often spoken
        of by the old writers of antiquity. A celebrated modern traveller, M. Thevenot,
        librarian to the king of France, states, that, when he journeyed from the
        Isthmus of Suez to Cairo, some time about the end of the seventeenth century,
        he was greatly annoyed by one of these hot winds, which lasted for a whole
        day, and that the caravan travelling to Mecca was so infested by one the year
        before, that they lost 2000 men in a single night. A very singular instance
        of the direful malignity of these winds happened in the year 1712, when two
        French gentle men determined to travel in the month of July from Gam broon,
        a port on the east of the Persian Gulf, to Ispahan, though warned of the consequences
        that were likely to result at that season of the year. The method which travellers
        pursue, is to set out about three o''clock in the morning, and to continue
        their journey till nine. This plan was followed by the party, who, being weary
        and fatigued with their morning''s march, and having arrived at a caravansary,
        a kind of lodging or resting place found at every stage of fifteen miles in
        many parts of the east, they gave orders to their servants to make their beds
        ready (for even such necessary furniture travellers are obliged to carry along
        with them, on camels or horses), directing that they should be called at dinner
        time. After having had a sheet dipped in water placed over each bed to cool
        them, they fell asleep, and during their slumbers one of these hot pestilential
        blasts occurred, and entering through the windows of the room, which were
        unfortunately left open, it scorched the two French gentlemen to death. When
        the servants at the appointed time went to call their masters, to their horror
        and amazement they found them both deprived of life, and in so dreadful and
        shocking a state were the bodies, that when they attempted to draw off the
        sheets, they brought with them both skin and flesh, leaving a spectacle too
        awfully disgusting to describe. It is fortunate that these winds blow only
        in a narrow com pass, and are also soon perceived, so that their baneful effects
        may be avoided by prostrating the body flat on the earth until the blast has
        passed over; whenever, therefore, a man on horseback meets with one of these
        unwelcome breezes, he in stantly dismounts, and turning his horse''s tail
        to the wind, throws himself down beside the noble animal, and thus pre serves
        the beast''s life and his own. On the western coast of the land of Ham, near
        Senegal and those parts, are certain cold winds, called Harmatans, which are
        as extraordinary as the burning hot blasts so prevalent along the eastern
        shores of that once fertile, but now desolate, quarter of the globe. These
        breezes are thought to be pro duced through the trade winds being interrupted
        in their course, as they pass over the deserts of Africa. They in General
        occur between the months of December and March. Though they are seldom accompanied
        with fogs, yet, during their continuance, the air is raw, moist, and cold,
        which often checks perspiration to a very serious and dangerous extent, rendering
        the skin dry, and frequently causing fevers and agues. Even the birds and
        beasts droop under the baneful influence of this ungenial temperature of the
        air, and the very woods seem to shrink from the pestilential vapour. Africa,
        in its southern parts at the Cape of Good Hope, is also often troubled with
        hurricanes, and so are many of the West India Islands. These violent storms
        can in general be foretold, as they are mostly preceded by an extraordinary
        cloud, called by mariners the bull''s-eye, because, when first seen, it looks
        like a small black spot at an immense distance, on the very verge of the horizon.
        During the gradual in crease of this cloud, a perfect but awful stillness
        reigns over the sea and land, until it arrives at that point when its fury
        is to burst, the whole heavens then become involved in pitchy darkness. During
        its progress, a hollow murmuring sound is heard issuing from the cavities
        of the mountains and rocks, and animals and birds, sensible of its approach,
        are seen fleeing across the plains, seeking shelter. When its violence begins,
        it is truly awful ; the houses in these countries, which are built of timber
        the better to resist its impetuosity, bend to the rugged blast like osier
        twigs, and again recover their erect posture. The sun, which but a moment
        before shone with meridian splendour, is now lost to sight, and a midnight
        gloom prevails, except that the sky is ever and anon illuminated with flashes
        of lightning, so fierce and strong, that a person may easily see to read ;
        at the same time the rain comes down in such violent torrents, that it can
        only be compared to the water pouring down our house spouts after a terrific
        summer thunder storm. These hurricanes are most offensive to the olfactory
        nerves, for they never come without leaving behind them the most disagreeable
        and noisome effluvia. Should a seaman at this period lay by his wet clothes
        for twenty-four hours, they will be found swarming with little white maggots,
        the produce of the tempest. Our mariners, when they first visited these',

        furnished infor- mation for the work, the author would here return his grateful
        acknowledgments, particularly to the venerable T. M. Harris, D. D., librarian
        of the Historical Society, and to Maturin L. Fisher, Esq., formerly librarian,
        and also to Samuel F. Haven, Esq., the present librarian of the American Antiquarian
        Society, for their readiness to afford every facility in their power in accomplishing
        the object of the work. The statements respecting the business done in each
        town were copied from the " Statistical Tables," published by the state in
        1837. With regard to the title, it being somewhat similar to that of the volumes
        published by the Historical Society, it was, at first, not thought advisable
        to adopt the one now selected ; upon further reflection, however, as the work
        could not, with propriety, be called a History of Massachusetts, but is properly
        a col lection of materials ; and as the title is in fact different from the
        volumes above men. tioned, it is believed that no just grounds of complaint
        are given by adopting the present title of the book. In giving the ecclesiastical
        history of the several towns, it may perhaps be thought, by some, that an
        undue prominence is given to the Congregational denomination. In reference
        to this, it is to be remembered they are the most ancient, as well as most
        numerous, denomination in the commonwealth ; that almost all the town histories
        which have appeared have been written by clergymen of that order ; and of
        course it is to be expected that the religious history of their own denomination
        would receive their first attention. In this publication, impartiality has
        been attempted ; and whenever authentic accounts of other denominations have
        been obtained they have been inserted. Owing to prescribed limits, there has
        been an absolute necessity of being brief on many subjects of importance :
        many things have been omitted which it was desirable to have inserted. There
        are materials enough to have extended this publi cation far beyond its present
        limits ; but to have extended it to more than one volume would have rendered
        it too expensive for general circulation. The drawings for the numerous engravings
        interspersed throughout the book were, with few exceptions, taken on the spot
        by the author of this work. Before deciding upon the correctness of these
        representations, he wishes his readers to remember that the appearance of
        any place will vary considerably as it is viewed from different points : thus
        a north view will appear quite different from one taken at the south. A person
        not being used to see a place from the point from which the drawing is made
        it may not at the first sight be readily recognised. Before any view is condemned
        as being incorrect, it will be necessary, in order to form a correct judgment,
        to stand on the place from whence the drawing was made. In giving notices
        of distinguished individuals, a limited number only could be inserted. In
        some instances the information respecting some towns may have been defective.
        The history of some important towns may apparently not have received that
        attention to which they are entitled. This is owing to two principal reasons
        : one is the failure to obtain the desired information after the attempt was
        made ; the other is the fact, that of some important places but little can
        be said which would be of general interest. Amid such a number of names, dates,
        &c, it is probable some mistakes may have occurred. A certain writer defines
        all history to be merely " an approxima tion towards truth." Though this humiliating
        statement cannot be fully allowed, yet, when the imperfection of every thing
        human is considered, it cannot be denied but that it may have some foundation
        in truth. April, 1839. J- W. B.', 3]

        \ on a beautiful rise of ground, in CharlestoAvn, near East Cambridge, and\
        \ about a mile and a half from the City Hall. The buildings are large, and\
        \ are exceedingly well adapted to their philanthropic design. They cost about\
        \ $186,000. \" This house was opened for patients on the 6th of October, 1818,\
        \ and from that time to January 1, 1834, 1015 patients were received. Of this\
        \ number, 264 were mar ried, and 340 unmarried, males; 238 married, and 173\
        \ unmarried, females. Of this number, 70 were from 10 to 20 years of age ;\
        \ 616 from 20 to 40, (of which 368 were males, and 248 females ;) 191 from\
        \ 40 to 50 ; 91 from 50 to 60 ; and 47 from 60 to 80. Of this number, 362\
        \ recovered, 143 were much improved, 140 benefitted, 89 died, 21 eloped, 193\
        \ were not improved, and 67 remained in the asylum. Of this number 112 had\
        \ been intemperate ; 122 had insane ancestors ; and 59 had near collaterals,\
        \ but no ancestors stated as insane. The average current expenses of each\
        \ patient at this asylum is estimated at $4 50 a week. The lowest rate for\
        \ which patients belonging to this state are received, is $3 a week \u2014\
        \ from other states, S4 50 a week. The num ber of patients received from January\
        \ 1, 1834, to June 19, 1835, was 150. The num ber of patients at the latter\
        \ date was 88, which was a greater number than at any former period. Rurus\
        \ Wyman, M. D., was superintendent and physician from the commencement of\
        \ the asylum to May, 1835, to whom the public is much indebted for the great\
        \ intelligence and fidelity by which he has advanced its usefulness. \" Belonging\
        \ to, and surrounding this asylum, are about 15 acres of land appropri ated\
        \ to courts and gardens. These are laid out with gravelled walks; the former\
        \ are furnished with summer-houses, and the latter are ornamented with groves\
        \ of fruit and ornamental trees, shrubbery, and flowers. Surrounding the lower\
        \ garden, and within the enclosure, is a carriage path, where patients are\
        \ taken to ride. In the center is a small fresh-water pond, containing several\
        \ hundred gold and silver fish, and immedi ately contiguous is a summer-house,\
        \ where the patients at times resort for games and amusements. \" The system\
        \ of moral treatment adopted and pursued is founded upon principles of elevated\
        \ benevolence and philanthropy, and an acquaintance with human nature and\
        \ the capabilities and wants of the insane. The previous tastes, habits, and\
        \ pursuits, and the present inclinations and feelings of each individual,\
        \ are habitually consulted. A library for the use of the patients has recently\
        \ been purchased, and those of them who are disposed to read are permitted\
        \ at stated periods to send in their names and the number of the book desired\
        \ ; the list is examined and approved by the physician, and the books are\
        \ distributed by the librarian. In the same way, writing materials are distributed\
        \ and patients are engaged in keeping journals, writing sketches of their\
        \ lives, poetry, addressing letters to their friends, and in drawing, ccc.\
        \ Some engage in games, as bowling, throwing the ring, battledoor, graces,\

        \ at his coronation ; secondly, that they should lead the vanguard of the\
        \ army, whenever the royal banner was displayed : and, lastly, this privilege\
        \ of clan Macduff whereby any person, being related to Macduff within the\
        \ ninth degree, and having committed homi cidein chande melle (without premeditation),\
        \ should, upon flying to Macd tiff's Cross, and paying a certain fine, obtain\
        \ remission of their guilt. Such, at least, is the account given of the law\
        \ by all our historian?. Nevertheless, there seems ground to suspect that\
        \ the privilege did not amount to an actual and total remission of the crime,\
        \ but only to a right of being exempted from all other courts of jurisdiction,\
        \ except that of the lord of Fife. The reader is presented with an old document,\
        \ in which the law of clan Macduff is pleaded on behalf of one of the ancesters\
        \ of Moray of Aberciirncy ; and it is remarkable that he does not claim any\
        \ immunity, but solely a right of being repledged, because his cause had already\
        \ been tried by Robert earl of Fife, the sole competent judge. But the privilege\
        \ of being answerable only to the chief v^ their own clan was, to the descendants\
        \ of Macduff, almost equivalent to an absolute in demnity. MacdufFs Cross\
        \ was situated near Lindores, on the march dividing Fife from Strathern. The\
        \ form of this venerable monument unfortunately offended the zeal of the reformer,\
        \ Knox, and it was totally demolished by his followers. The pedestal, a solid\
        \ block of stone, alone escaped the besom of destruction. It bore an inscription,\
        \ which, according to the apocryphal account of sir Robert Sibbald, was a\
        \ mixture of Latin, Saxon, Danish, and old French. Skene has preserved two\
        \ lines : \"Propter Makgridim et hoc oblatum, Accipe Smeleridem super lampade\
        \ limpid\xE6 labrum \" Skene, de verb. sig. voce Clan Macduff. The full inscription,\
        \ real or pretended, may be found in sir Robert Sibbald's \" History of Fife,\"\
        \ and in James Cunninghame's \"Essay upon MacdufFs Cross,\" together with\
        \ what is called a translation, or rather paraphrase, of the piebald jargon\
        \ which composes it. In Gough's edition of Camden's Britannia, a different\
        \ and more intelligible version is given, on the authority of a Mr. Douglas\
        \ of Newburgh. The cross was dedicated to a St. Macgider. Around the pedestal\
        \ are tumuli, said to be the graves of those who, having claimed the privi_\
        \ lege of the law, failed in proving their consanguinity to the Thane of Fife.\
        \ Such persons were instantly executed. The people of Newburgh believe that\
        \ the spectres of these criminals still haunt the ruined cross, and claim\
        \ that mercy for their souls which they had failed to obtain for their mortal\
        \ existence. The late lord Hailes gives it as his opinion, that the indulgence\
        \ was only to last till the tenth generation from Macduff. Fordun and Wintoun\
        \ state, that the fine, to be paid by the person taking sanctuary, was twenty-four\
        \ merks for a gentleman, and twelve merks for a yeoman. Skene affirms it to\

        Among the fragments of animals of which the race has perished, is the celebrated

        has ever been discovered. Along with these antediluvian relics, there are
        some modern curio sities, such as canoes, large and safe, hollowed from a
        single bone, &c. The library is recovering rapidly. It already contains about
        thirty thousand volumes ; but being formed from general contributions, the
        collection is not very select. The catalogue is on a principle seldom employed
        inEngland. In placeof keeping a folio for entering each work as it arrives,
        the title is written on a loose slip of paper, which is placed, under its
        proper letter, in a line of open boxes, five inches square, along the side
        of a desk con taining a box for each letter of the Russian alpha bet. This,
        though a very mechanical system, is found very convenient for the librarians.

        \ I looked in vain for the important letter of Lord Oxford in September, 1716,\
        \ which was seen by Sir James Mackintosh at Carlton House ; nor could I find\
        \ a very curious document, which is mentioned in the minutes of the Commissioners,\

        \ same state as when they were first delivered over to his charge. These papers\

        maps, has received large additions since the last anniversary. It is still,
        however, very far from what it ought to be ; and I hope that the liberality
        with which members are allowed the use of it will continue to stimulate a
        corresponding liberality on the part of those, who are in a state to augment
        the collection by voluntary contributions. We have received, among many other
        donations to the library, " The Silurian System," founded on geological researches
        in some of the western counties of England, by Mr. Murchison ; some additional
        sheets of the Ordnance Survey of England, aud the Townland Survey of Ire land
        ; various charts from the Hydrographic Office at the Admiralty ; and princely
        donations from the Dep6t de la Guerre, and the Dep6t de la Marine, of France,
        and from the Dep6ts Topographiques of Wur temberg and Austria, for the latter
        of which we are also much indebted to our zealous honorary member, Baron C.
        Hugel; several valuable documents from the Court of Directors of the East
        India Company ; and we have this day received from Capt. Fitz Roy, the " Narrative
        of the Surveying Voyages of Her Majesty''s Ships Adventure and Beagle, be
        tween the years 1826 and 1836, describing the examination of the southern
        shores of South America, and the Beagle''s circumnavigation of the Globe;"
        besides many excellent maps from Mr. John Arrow smith, the Transactions of
        the Imperial and Royal Academies of St. Petersburg and Berlin, Paris and Lisbon,
        and numerous donations which are recorded in the volume of our Journal now
        issuing from the press. But here, Gentlemen, we are subject to a very serious
        inconvenience, the whole extent and nature of which ought not to be withheld
        from you. We have long suffered from the straitened room available for our
        public business, and most particularly for the accommodation of members who
        may wish to consult the library, whether for instruction or recreation. Our
        books and maps are piled in heaps on the chairs and tables above stairs in
        most deplorable confusion ; and although every pains are taken, and effectually
        taken too, by your Secretary and by the Librarian, to preserve some degree
        of order amongst the various articles of your pro perty, which, from their
        high value and usefulness, do ill deserve such treatment, still, every day
        and hour furnish instances of the evil occa sioned by the want of a larger
        apartment for reading, for drawing, for comparing and construction of maps,
        for the exhibition of instruments, for the reception of strangers, and for
        what is by no means the least useful or the least agreeable of our pursuits,
        the mutual exchange of ideas amongst the members of the Society, for the promotion
        of the cause which has so happily and so honourhbly brought us together. I
        took occasion in my address to you last year to advert pointedly to this',

        \ King James's residence in Ireland, a college was opened in Back Lane ; but,\
        \ having been transferred to Trinity College on the Revolution, it was soon\

        \ lands by Charles II. In 1698 a new fellowship was en dowed from a bequest\

        \ funds of Erasmus Smith; in 1762 two more from the bequest of Provost Baldwin;\
        \ and in 1808 three more were endowed out of the increased revenues of the\

        \ the duties of secretary or actuary to the provost and senior fellows ; two\
        \ Bursars ; a Registrar for the electors admitted under the Reform Act ; an\
        \ Auditor ; six University preach ers ; four morning lecturers ; and nine\
        \ examiners. The ordinary details of management are superintended by the provost\
        \ and senior fellows, who in this capacity are called \" The Board,\" and\
        \ hold a meeting every Saturday. The system of instruction is carried on by\
        \ means of professorships, lectures, and periodical examinations. The professors\
        \ are as follow : \u2014 the Regius Professor of Divinity, established on\
        \ the first foun dation of the college ; the Regius Professor of Civil and\
        \ Canon Law ; the Regius Professor of Feudal and English Law ; the Regius\
        \ Pro fessor of Physic ; the Regius Professor of Greek ; a Lecturer in Divinity\
        \ on the foundation of Archbishop King, in 1718 ; a second Lecturer of Divinity,\
        \ founded under a bequest of Mrs. Anne Don nelan for the encouragement of\
        \ religion, learning, and good manners ; a Lecturer in Mathematics, founded\
        \ by Arthur Earl of Donegal in the 17th century. From the funds of Erasmus\
        \ Smith have been endowed the five professorships of natural philosophy, oratory,\
        \ ma thematics, history, and the Oriental languages. The professorship of\

        Jackson Hooker, of Glasgow ; and that on Zoology by William Swainson, Esq.
        The important articles on the English Constitution and Courts of Law were
        contributed by F. Forster, Esq. A.M., Barrister at Law, and Fellow of Wadham
        College, Oxford ; and we believe we run little risk in saying that they present
        one of the best as well as most compendious outlines of the constitution that
        is any where to be met with. The chapter on Corporations is by Charles Neate,
        Esq., Barrister at Law. The account of the Constitution and Courts of Law
        of Scotland was contributed by William Spalding, Esq., A. M., Advocate. The
        articles on the Constitution, Courts of Law, Religious Esta blishments, Education,
        and Poor of Ireland were supplied by the Rev. Edward Groves, of the Record
        Office, Dublin. But it is due to that gentleman to state that he is not responsible
        for the state ments on pages 312. and 313. of the second volume, nor for the
        reasoning in favour of the introduction of a system of poor-laws into Ireland.
        The articles on the Religious Establishments and Education of Scotland are
        by Thomas Murray, Esq. LL.D., of Edinburgh ; and are models of what such articles
        should be. The article on Education in England and Wales, containing a luminous
        account of the systems of education followed at the great public schools,
        and at the Universities cf Oxford and Cambridge, is the contribution of Herman
        Merivale, Esq. A.M., Barrister at Law. William Farr, Esq., Surgeon, is the
        author of the elaborate and original article on Vital Statistics. The account
        of the Compulsory Provision for the Poor of Eng land, and of the changes effected
        by the late act, was furnished by George Coode, Esq., Barrister at Law, Assistant
        Secretary to the Poor Law Commissioners. Dr. Irving, Librarian to the Faculty
        of Advocates, Edinburgh, is the author of the chapter on the Origin and Progress
        of the English Language. For the remainder of the work, and its general supervision,
        the Editor is responsible. We are quite aware that, notwithstanding the pains
        that have been taken to make this publication worthy of the subject, it is
        fairly open to much criticism. Some may think that we have discussed various
        topics that had been better omitted to the exclusion of others of greater
        importance ; and others, without objecting to the subjects,', 1]
    - ["PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. It has long been matter of surprise and regret\
        \ to many, that there should be no modern work developing, within a moderate\
        \ compass, the physical capacities, population, industry, and institutions\
        \ of the British empire. The latest work of the kind that has attracted any\
        \ notice is the State of Great Britain and Ireland, by Chamberlayne, the last\
        \ edition of which was published so far back as the reign of George II. But,\
        \ though this once popular publication contains a good deal of use ful information,\
        \ it is not written on any scientific plan, or with any considerable discrimination\
        \ ; while the change of circumstances, since the peace of Paris in 1763, would\
        \ have rendered it, how good soever it might originally have been, quite obsolete\
        \ for many years past. The want of any separate publication on the state of\
        \ the empire has been but indifferently supplied by the notices of it in other\
        \ works. Speaking generally, geographical science in this country has been,\
        \ until very recently, at the lowest ebb, while, during the long interval\
        \ between Sir \"William Petty and Dr. Beeke, statistical science could hardly\
        \ be said to exist. Hence the accounts of Great Britain and Ireland, given\
        \ in our Encyclop\xE6dias and geographical works, are, for the most part,\
        \ very meager and defective. The article on England in the Edinburgh Encyclop\xE6\
        dia, written by the late William Ste venson, Esq., Librarian to the Treasury,\
        \ is undoubtedly the best of this class of publications. The space allotted\
        \ to it was, however, too confined ; so that some very important subjects,\
        \ such as those relating to population, education, the poor, revenue and expenditure,\
        \ army and navy, &c, are disposed of in the briefest and most unsatisfactory\
        \ manner. The accounts of agriculture and manufactures are the best parts\
        \ of the article, and are superior to any that had appeared when it was printed\
        \ in 1815. Since this \xE6ra a number of detached treatises of various merit\
        \ have been published on different branches of industry ; and our political,\
        \ commercial, and financial systems have been subjected not only to a more\
        \ thorough examination than they had previously undergone, but to many important\
        \ changes. Much valuable information has also been acquired under the acts\
        \ for taking the census in 1821 and 1831,", 1]

        \ is at present librarian. The new Coffee Room, at the corner ofthe Square,\
        \ was com menced in 1820, and finished the same year. The reason of this new\
        \ erection was in consequence ofa difference having arisen between a number\
        \ of the subscribers and the proprietors of the Exchange Buildings. As the\
        \ secession was almost immediate, or at least before the new room was built,\
        \ the members were accommodated with a room in the White Hart Inn, then unlet.\
        \ The expense of this erection amounted to nearly \xA32500 ; aud cer tainly\
        \ there are few rooms more splendid, having a fine cupola, and otherwise finished\
        \ in an elegant manner. This room, like the other, is well supplied with various\
        \ papers, &c, and is equally liberal in allowing privileges to all strangers,\
        \ without introduction, for six weeks. In 1810 the Jail, or Bridewell, was\
        \ built. It is situated be hind the Mid Parish Church, in a fine open space,\
        \ enclosed with a wall ; and is bu..* something in the style of an old castle,\
        \ hav ing two towers in front, with battlements at the top. This is the only\
        \ place occupied as a prison for criminals ; and contains a debtor's apartment,\
        \ besides a place where the criminals labour. Previous to its erection, the\
        \ Jail, or Black Hole, was in front of the Town's House ; but the first \"\
        \ durance vile\" which was used in Greenock was a thatched house at the bottom\
        \ of Broad Closs, where the Jugs were hung in terrorem of offenders; and another\
        \ set of Jugs were hung for the same laudable purpose at the West Quay-head,\
        \ in a house called the Inspector's Land. The Keep, or, as it was called,\
        \ massy-more ofthe Mansion-house, was after wards used as a prison, and continued\
        \ to be so till after the year 1765, when the Town Buildings were erected.\
        \ In 1818, an extensive building was erected on the East Quay for the customs\
        \ and excise, but known as the Customhouse. It is a great ornament to the\
        \ town ; and, from its situation, being on the centre of the quay, where the\
        \ steam-boats arrive, is seen to much advantage by strangers either visiting\
        \ or passing the port. It has a fine esplanade in front, from which there\

        \ to be an elegant building, capable of containing the Greenock Library, instituted\
        \ in 1783, and con taining about 7000 volumes. In a hall, fitted up for the\
        \ purpose, is to be placed a statue of Mr. Watt, executed in Chantry's happiest\
        \ manner. The sum for the statue was raised by sub scription, and amounts\
        \ to \xA31700 ; and Mr. Watt of Soho intends to give the necessary sum for\
        \ the erection of the building, amounting to about \xA33000. When the Library\

        who had been bishop of Ossory, and died a prebendary of Can terbury in 1563,
        in the sixty-eighth year of his age. He was an unfair assailant of popery,
        which he had repudiated. His brief" Chronicle concerning Sir John Old castle
        wasrepublishedin 1729." He is also the author of several plays on sacred sub
        jects, some of which, he says, were piously represented by young men in his
        own days at the market-cross of Kilkenny. But the chief work of the bishop,
        and the only one now referred to, is the " Lives of the emi nent Writers of
        Britain ; " from Japhet, the son of Noah, to the year 1557,- when the author
        was an exile in Germany. Sir Thomas Chaloner was a writer of varied erudition,
        but more celebrated as a soldier and diplomatist. After publishing the first
        part of his greatest work, * On the right ordering of the English Republic,"
        he died, much regretted, in 1565, in his for tieth year. His son was celebrated
        for his knowledge of chemistry, and discovered the first alum mines known

        MEN. A.D. 1547 to 1603. The Elizabethan age was more pre-emi nent in literature
        than science, and its men of letters chiefly excelled in the production of
        works of history and the imagination. Its sweet poetry helped to correct the
        auste rities of puritanism, but there were still no sound teachers of moral
        and political philo sophy. The next reign was more ''advanced, and minds appeared
        who sought to enlarge the circle of knowledge by more compre hensive deductions
        than those derived from classic and scriptural quotations. The lite rary character
        of the time will appear from the following notice of the chief writers who
        flourished in the latter half of the sixteenth century. Sir Thomas Smith was
        an acute meta physician, accomplished statesman, and able soldier. He was
        professor of Greek at Cambridge, and suggested a new mode of accenting that
        language ; he also formed a new alphabet for the English tongup, consisting
        of twenty-nine letters. To him collegiate bodies are indebted for the sta
        tute which directs, that the "third part of the rent on college leases should
        be re served in corn. Sir Thomas died in 1577, at his seat, Mounthall, in
        Essex, aged 67 years. William Fleetwood was an eminent law yer, and appointed
        recorder of London in 1569. He was the author of a. " Treatise on the Office
        of Justice of the Peace,7'' and other law tracts. Wood says, he was " a good
        antiquary, but of a marvellous merry and pleasant conceit." He descended from
        a respectable Lancashire family, ami died at his seat, at Great Missenden,
        in Buck inghamshire, in 1593. Sir Walter Raleigh, who was beheaded in 1618,
        belongs to the next, rather than the present reign, but as his prosperous
        days ended with the death of Elizabeth, he may be suitably noticed in this
        place. He was the son of a Devonshire gentle man, and a distinguished warrior,
        states man, and writer. His expedition to Ame rica, while under sentence for
        high treason, and his urging, and personally witnessing, the execution of
        the earl of Essex, are the most questionable acts in his biography. His literary''
        works were chiefly composed during his imprisonment of twelve years Edward
        Hall, who died in 1547, was a Londoner, bred at Eton and King''s Col lege,
        Cambridge. He was a judge in the sheriff''s court, and member of the house
        of commons. His " Chronicle of the Wars between the Roses " is valuable, and
        curi ous as affording delineations of the man ners, dress, and customs of
        the people dur ing that turbulent era. John Leland was chaplain, librarian,
        and antiquarian to Henry VIII. To him is owing the preservation of numerous
        manu scripts, which the libraries of religious houses contained, and which,
        by accepting the office of visitor at their dissolution, he saved from destruction.
        He became in sane, either from the excessive fatigue of arranging these papers,
        or some other cause, and died in 1552. Apart of his volumi nous collections
        was printed by Hearne, in 9 vols. 8vo, under the title of a The Itinerary
        of John Leland." The rest of his works remain in MS, in the Bodleian library.',

        \ in that office occur) Dr. Mayo, of Richmond, who will have the honour of\
        \ handing you this letter. He has peculiar qualifications for the duties of\
        \ that place, being a linguist, conversant with books, an author, and habitually\
        \ studious of that sort of information which a bibliographer should possess.\
        \ By habits, learning, and long familiarity with books, he is qualified to\

        \ sacrifices as the editor of the Jackson Republican, in Richmond, entitle\
        \ him also to the favourable notice of the govern ment. I have already recommended\
        \ him to the State Department, but so firm is my persuasion of his suitableness\
        \ and merit, that I give this additional testimonial in his favour with cheerfulness.\

        \ according to philosophical analysis, genius has performed her part, and\

        the purpose of purchasing books from the library of Richard Heber, Esq. who

        \ chief mag*istrate of the United States is elected by a body of distinct\
        \ electors, qualified within each state.* Their votes are sent under seal\
        \ to congress who have the right of electing the president, if the candidate\
        \ have not more than half the whole number of votes in his favour. The powers\
        \ ofthe president, during his administration of four years, are very extensive.\
        \ See them stated, as well as the privileges and rights of congress, in the\
        \ constitution. His salary is, 25,000 dollars, or 5125/.; that of the vice\
        \ president, 5000 dollars, or 1025/. The powers vested by the constitution\
        \ in the central government extend to all negotiations with foreign nations\
        \ ; maintaining and organising the naval and military forces ; the sole regulation\
        \ of foreign trade ; and all matters connected with the general revenue and\
        \ finances. The views taken by the federalists, and the democrats, of the\
        \ constitution of the United States, have, frequently, been greatly opposed\
        \ to each other. Of the several jurists who have written on the constitution\
        \ of the United States; the authors of the Federalists, Judge Story and Chief-justice\
        \ Kent are the most emi nent. The late learned Secretary of State, Mr. Upshur,\
        \ appears to us to have comprehended that celebrated act more clearly than\
        \ any other jurist. \" A work,\" says MMr. Upshur,! \" presenting a proper\
        \ analysis and correct views of the constitution of the United States, has\
        \ long been a desideratum with the public. It is true that the last fifteen\
        \ years have not been unfruitful in commentaries upon that instrument: such\
        \ commentaries, however, as have, for the most part, met a deserved fate in\
        \ immediate and total oblivion. A few have appeared, however, of a much higher\
        \ order, and bearing the stamp of talent, learning, and research. Among these,\
        \ the work of Judge Story and the 'Commentaries' of Chief Justice Kent hold\
        \ the first rank. Both these works are, as it is natural they should be, strongly\
        \ tinctured with the political opinions of their respective authors ; and\
        \ as there is a perfect concurrence between them in this respect, their joint\
        \ authority can scarcely fail to exert a strong influence upon public opinion.\
        \ \" The authority of great names is of such imposing weight, that mere reason\
        \ and argu ment can rarely counterpoise it in the public mind ; and its preponderance\
        \ is not easily * See the 2nd article of the constitution, and the 12th article\
        \ of the Amendments. f The late Judge Upshur, a short time before his lamentable\
        \ death, sent me his views on the Constitution ofthe United States. They are\
        \ so remarkable that I consider the leading parts, which I have extracted,\
        \ as absolutely necessary to a just understanding of the Constitution of the\
        \ United States, as a confedcrative government, and as elucidating the separate\
        \ constitutions of the several states, The late Mr Upshur was one of the highest\
        \ legal authorities in the United States. His predecessor in the office of\
        \ secretary of state, Mr. Legarfe, was also a profound lawyer and my personal\
        \ friend. He was carried off' suddenly while on a visit to Boston, in 1842\
        \ ; and Mr. Upshur, who succeeded him, was destroyed, with several others,\
        \ in 1843, by the bursting ofa monstrous cannon on board a steam frigate.\
        \ A more pure-minded statesman, and more virtuous man than Mr. Upshur, I believe\
        \ there did not exist.", 2]

        \ and Henry Howard, Esq. The soil is generally wet and cold, with a substratum\
        \ of clay. In 1767 an Act of Parliament was obtained for enclosing the common,\
        \ containing nearly 4000 acres. About the year 1775 a cairn was opened at\
        \ Loaden-how, in which were found two urns, with burnt bones, and a large\
        \ sized skull. The parish contains the three townships of Skelton, Lamonby,\
        \ and Unthank. Skei.TON is a neat compact village, pleasantly situated ou\
        \ an eminence, 6 miles N.W. of Penrith. The Church, which is dedicated to\
        \ St. Mary and St. Michael, is an ancient structure, consisting of a nave,\
        \ chancel, and a square stone tower, with two bells. Upon one of the two bells\
        \ which for merly belonged to the church, was the inscription Ave Maria gratioz\
        \ plena, and on the other, Sancte Michael ora pro nobis. The church was covered\
        \ with blue slates, and thoroughly repaired in 1794. It formerly contained\
        \ a richly endowed chantry, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, but its\
        \ pos sessions were granted by Edward VI. to \" Ward, Venables, and others.\"\
        \ The living is a rectory, valued in the king's books at \xA343. 2s. Sd. but\
        \ is now worth \xA3294. per annum. The tithes have been commuted for a yearly\
        \ rent charge of \xA3110. In 1607 the advowson was purchased by Corpus Christi\
        \ College, Oxford ; and the present rector is the Revd. John Dayman, M. A.\
        \ The parish School was built in 1750, with \xA350. left by Joseph Milner,\

        \ In 1584, 1 homos Wilson granted an annuity of 20s. to the poor ofthis parish,\

        \ with flowered mouldings, and an enriched triangular canopy ; and above the\
        \ door is a large window of sour lights, having its head filled with good\

        \ paragraph from Balfour's \"Ann from which the preceding quotation is taken\
        \ : \u2014 \"The 29th March this year (1636) died Dame upon the first occasion\

        \ appoint, and to enter the same in his Ma- jesty's pay. Besides his general\
        \ plantation of the country, he rebuilt Newtown House, repaired the old castle\
        \ and the church, and by his will left a legacy sufficient to rebuild tbe\
        \ additional church j contiguous to the body of the old one, which, soon after\
        \ his death, was performed by his son, who ! then came to reside at Newtown.\

        \ of God with large Bibles of the new translation, and Common Frayer Books,\
        \ printed 1603. He built the quay or harbour of Donaghadee, a great and profitable\
        \ work (128 yards in length). He erected a great school in Newtown, endowing\
        \ it with \xA320 a year for a gra- duate in arts to teach Latin, Greek, and\
        \ logic ; j and paid stipends to writing and music masters. He also repaired\

        \ from the Rhins of Galloway or Port-Patrick to Donaghadee, and to appoint\
        \ a yearly magistrate to govern that place. On the 22d November, 1005, he\

        \ February, 1621 ; and, 28th November, 1626, his second lady, Sarah, and his\
        \ eldest son's wife. By letters patent under the Great Seal of England, bearing\

        re ceived. They may also raise any additional amount, not exceeding twice
        the amount of the apportionment, which the electors of any town may vote to
        raise, for school purposes. The amounts thus raised are to be paid over to
        the town superintendents, for distribu tion among the districts. In addition
        to these sums, many ofthe towns annually receive in comes from local funds,
        arising either from the sale of school lots, reserved in laying out new townships,
        in 1789, or from bequests, &c. In most of the large cities, large additional
        amounts are also raised, under special acts, providing for the organization
        and support of com mon schools. The aggregate amount of funds applicable to
        school purposes, may be stated as follows. Apportioned from state funds ....

        territory of the state has been divided into about 11,000 school districts,
        each averaging nearly four square miles. The voters of each district choose
        three trustees, of whom one holds his office for one year, one for two, and
        one for three years, a district clerk, collector and librarian, who hold their
        office one year each. Town Superintendents. The town superintendents of common
        schools are annually elected, by the people of each of the towns, at their
        annual town meetings, and have the general supervision ofthe common schools
        in their respective towns. County Superintendents. The county superintendent
        is the next officer in the gradation of the system, and is appointed, once
        in two years, by the board of supervisors of each county. Either they, or
        the state superintendent, may remove him from office, for neglect of duty,
        or misconduct. Each county is required, by law, to have one county superintendent,
        and where the number of districts exceeds 150, two maybe appointed. These
        officers are charged with the general supervision of the schools of the county,
        or of that section of the county, for which they are appointed. Their compensation
        may not exceed $500 a year; one half of which is paid by the county, and the

        \ young person much disturbed by Kemble's directions about lifting and lowering\
        \ the sword in the scene betwixt the princess Anne and Richard. Mr. Kemble,\
        \ in the winter season of 1784-5, was supersedes in his temporary character\
        \ of manager by King's return to that situation. But in 1788-9, the veteran\
        \ finally retreated from the office, and from that time Kemble remained manager\
        \ of Drurv Lane until 1790, when the irregularity with which the proprietors\
        \ managed their pecuniary matters, and their frequent interference with his\
        \ authority, induced him to resign the situation. He again returned to the\
        \ thankless office in 1800-1, with some intention of obtaining a secure hold\
        \ by pur chasing one fourth part of the whole concern. This plan failed; and,\
        \ in 180'2, Kemble finally retired from Drury Lane, and made a purchase of\
        \ a fourth share of the Covent Garden patent. He was now not only a manager,\
        \ but a large proprietor, a specula tion which, producing some difficulties,\
        \ afterwards interfered with the quiet of his declining years. As stated by\
        \ Mr. Boaden, it may be wondered why, with no expensive habits, with professional\
        \ emoluments to the amount of about \xA33000 a-year, and witli a considerable\
        \ sum of money saved, with out wliich he could not have made the purchase,\
        \ this amiable and good-tempered man should have involved his whole fortune\
        \ in a property which he knew to be so very precarious that he himself always\
        \ talked of it as a lottery, and confined him self for life to the duty of\
        \ management which he had often felt to be accompanied by intolerable grievances.\
        \ But John Kemble was a sworn votary to the drama ; and though he certainly\
        \ did bow the knee to Baal iii becoming an encourager of the inordinate rage\
        \ for spectacle, which at once impo verished the concern and debauched the\
        \ public taste, he laboured hard, on the other hand, to bring forward ancient\
        \ pieces which he thought might be revived with renewed interest. He had undoubt\
        \ edly the laudable wish to raise as high as possible the art to which, as\
        \ much from the excellence of his personal, as of his professional character,\
        \ he was an honour. Kemble may be, therefore, consi dered as having, with\
        \ his eyes open, made a sacri fice of fortune, of peace of mind, and of the\
        \ bodily ease which frequent fits of the gout rendered desir able, in order\
        \ to sustain the honour of his art. The discomfort to which he was exposed\
        \ never fretted his temper ; and not even the gout itself, mistress of men's\
        \ purposes and their actions too in most cases, could conquer his strong resolution\
        \ to do his duty towards the public. He used to take the somewhat hazardous\
        \ medicine I'eau medicinale d'llusson without hesitation, so as to enable\
        \ him to perform the very day after his malady had made its most severe attacks.\
        \ It could not but happen that he was sometimes less equal to his part than\
        \ at others, and such an occasional failure led to a painful dispute, which\
        \ for some time created a breach between him and his friend George Colman\
        \ the Younger. We mention the subject, not with the purpose of raking up the\
        \ recollections which both parties had buried, but because Mr. Boaden is a\
        \ little mistaken in some of the particulars. When Mr. Colman brought forward\
        \ his play of the Iron Chest, founded on the masterpiece of Godwin's genius,\
        \ Caleb Williams, he put into the mouth of one of the characters a description\
        \ of the antiqua rian humours of Mortimer, the Falkland of the play, which\
        \ part was to be performed by Kemble : \" Philip is all deep reading, and\
        \ black letter ; He shows it in his very chin. He speaks Mere dictionary ;\
        \ and he pores on pages That give plain men the head-ache. ' Scarce and curious\
        \ ' Are baits his learning nibbles at. His brain Is crammed with mouldy volumes,\
        \ cramp and useless, Like a librarian's lumber-room.\" Kemble conceived that\
        \ these lines were unne cessarily introduced, as throwing ridicule on his\
        \ antiquarian lore ; and Colman, upon his remon strance, changed the name\
        \ of Sir Philip to Sir Edward Mortimer, as it now stands. But the smartest\
        \ wag that ever broke a pun should beware of exereising his wit upon his physician,\
        \ his lawyer, or the actor who is to perform in his play. Kemble, unwell and\
        \ out of humour, acted negligently a part which requires violent exertion.\
        \ The irritated dramatist published the play with an angry preface, and the\
        \ actor responded. But a quarrel betwixt the author of Oetavian and John Kemble\
        \ was too unnatural ; they became sensible they had both been wrong, and were\
        \ reconciled, and the preface was so effectually cancelled, that the price\
        \ of a copy in which it remains, astounds the uovice when it occurs in the\
        \ sale room. Of Mr. Kemble as a manager, we have only fur ther to say, that\
        \ equally unsparing of his labour, and regardless of the ill-will which he\
        \ excited among those who suffered by his economy, he carried retrenchment\
        \ and good order into every department of the theatre. The good pubbc in the\
        \ meantime, though re turning ever and anon to Shakspeare and common sense,\
        \ were guilty of two or three grand absurdi ties, such as became the worthy\
        \ descendants of those whose fathers crowded the Haymarket Theatre, to see\
        \ a man get into a quart-bottle,1 and these were among the most powerful causes\
        \ that tended to obstruct the effect of Mr. Kemble's exer tions to restore\
        \ the reign of good taste in dramatic matters. Vortigern, a play ascribed\
        \ to Shakspeare, gave rise to one of these hallucinations of popular absur\
        \ dity. An impudent youth of eighteen, desirous of imitating Chatterton, it\
        \ may be supposed, but with out possessing any of his powers, told his father\
        \ a storv of having recovered certain extremely curi ous documents belonging\
        \ to Shakspeare, presented to him, as he said, by a benevolent old gentleman,\
        \ who had them by inheritance, but would not permit himself to be referred\
        \ to or quoted in the affair. The elder Mr. Ireland, believing, or pretending\
        \ to believe, this improbable fiction, put the tale into a poor Scotchman,\

        the Empire. Never was injustice more crying and monstrous than the policy
        pursued by Sir Robert Peel''s Government, in the instructions conveyed to
        its too weak and too willing servant at this period. Fortunately, how ever,
        the crisis of danger has passed. Circumstances having, not long after the
        arrival of Sir Charles Bagot, induced me to change my banishment in Brockville
        for the somewhat more stirring life of the new Canadian metropolis, I re solved,
        on the opening of the ensuing Parliament, to petition the House of Assembly
        for a grant of money in furtherance of the object of completion of my " War
        of 1812," that is to say, of the opera tions of the centre and left divisions,
        for many interesting records connected with which I was indebted, not only
        to the Adjutant General of Militia in Upper Canada, Colonel Bullock, but to
        Dr. Winder, the Librarian of the House of Assembly, and an old brother officer
        of General Brock, who, feeling all the pride of the soldier in the recollection
        of the events of that period, was, independently of his acknowledged urbanity
        and desire to afford information to those who sought it, extremely solicitous
        that some such record as that which I had undertaken, should be given to the
        world before the last of the actors in those scenes should have passed away
        for ever. Aware as I was, however, that a grant of this nature must ori ginate
        in a recommendation to the House from the Head of the Go vernment, I applied,
        by letter, to Sir Charles Bagot, stating the ob jects of the publication,
        the service it was likely to confer on the youth ofthe country, and the little
        doubt I entertained that, if re commended by His Excellency, the proposal
        would be adopted without difficulty by the House. In answer to this application,
        I received a long communication from the Civil Secretary, Mr. Raw son, of
        some three or four foolscap pages, the " sum tottle " of which was to assure
        me that His Excellency, however sensible of the value and importance of such
        a publication, could not possibly comply with my request. Whether His Excellency
        had so decided at the instance of his Radical Executive, I of course had no
        opportunity of ascertaining ; but certain it is, that these tender and conscientious
        gentlemen gave, as a ground of objection to the encouragement of the work,
        that it had a tendency to revive unpleasant recollections with " our neighbors,"
        the Americans, who would necessarily be pained to find that the assertions,
        contained in their various ac counts of that war, and disseminated through
        the whole ofthe Ca nadian schools, that they had invariably "whipped" the
        British, were so unexpectedly to be refuted. Mr. Hincks, the friend of M''Kenzie,

        now held the office of Inspector General, was particularly opposed to the
        publication. Somewhat daunted by this attempt to throw cold water on my efforts,
        I was yet resolved, if possible, to baulk the Executive, by pressing the subject
        in the way of petition, as I had originally- de signed, before the House ;
        and here I may as well observe, that in applying, in the first instance, to
        Sir Charles Bagot, I had not enter tained the most remote idea that I should
        receive any other than a reply in the negative. I was perfectly aware that
        he would con sult his Council on the subject, and these men I knew to be too
        indis posed to approve anything tending to reflect lustre upon the British',

        it was requisite to fetch fertile soil from a distance. Close in front of
        the church, upon the paved area of the court, lies beneath a cupola the tomb
        of San Saba. This, as well as the church and chapel, is richly deco rated
        in the usual style of the Greeks. From the nave of the church, which is mainly
        hewn out of the solid rock, I ascended some steps into an upper side-room,
        where there are arranged, upon trestles, about a hundred Greek and Arabic
        manuscripts, intermixed with some printed books. I took a hasty glance at
        each of them. After this I visited the chapel of St. John of Damascus, who
        wrote many of his learned works in the monastery, and lies buried in the chapel
        which bears his name. But, as a remarkable object for in spection, I was shown
        a dark chamber, wherein many hundred skulls lay piled up. They are said to
        be chiefly the remains of the last sanguinary attack which burst out upon
        the poor monks, during the Crusades, and which thoroughly extirpated them.
        I now had a slight dispute with the monks. Having expressed my astonishment
        that the contents of their library was so small, the librarian replied that
        there was another, in the tower above. Upon wishing to see it, I was told
        the key was not at hand, as the indivi dual, to whose custody it was committed,
        had gone this very morn ing to Jerusalem. I was incredulous, and became still
        more so, upon hearing immediately afterwards a violent dispute amongst the
        monks themselves, about the matter. It terminated in my being conducted to
        the tower ; an undertaking, indeed, of some trouble and labour, during the
        noontide heat of a July day in this climate. But I had not been deceived ;
        this library was, in fact, more con siderable than the first. Here, also,
        I inspected each manuscript, and the two monks who accompanied me speedily
        found that I was more conversant with the subject than themselves. The contents
        of this library were very like that which I found upon Mount Sinai. Among
        the many patristic, ecclesiastical, and B blical manuscripts, of which not
        a few were of the tenth and eleventh centuries, and many neatly executed,
        I found once more the ancient Hippocrates. Besides some Greek manuscripts,
        I observed several Russian, Waliachian, Arabic, and Syriac, as well as ten
        beautiful Abyssinian parchment manuscripts. Intermixed with the latter, I
        discovered a Greek uncial codex, an Evangeliscarium of the eighth or ninth
        century. My companions, however, would not believe that the work was Greek.until
        I read them several lines of it. Such is the extent of knowledge in a celebrated
        Greek monastery ! My investigations did not terminate favourably. I found
        a heap of manuscript fragments swept up into the corner as worthless. I asked
        if 1 might select some of them as reminiscences of my visit, o2', 1]

        \ rather of the Romish chancelry than of a document of the prophet. I was\
        \ most anxious to see another remarkable MS. of Sinai : this is a gospel said\
        \ to have been extant in the palace of the Emperor Theodosius. Cyrillus had\
        \ not seen it, notwithstanding his function of librarian ; but another brother,\
        \ as well as Signor Pietro, gave me a precise description of it. Thence, as\
        \ well as from previous com munications made to me about it at Cairo, the\
        \ MS. I conceive may be of the eleventh century. But all my exertions, both\
        \ conciliatory and imperative, were in vain. The explanations ran that the\
        \ MS. was in the archiepiscopal chapel, whose comptroller, who had but recently\
        \ taken office, was not to be found. Upon my return to Cairo, the bishop there\
        \ assured me that it had been sent a few years before to Constantinople, to\
        \ the archbishop, for the purpose of being copied. But even in Constantinople\
        \ I found no trace of it. This was a genuine instance upon all sides of the\
        \ Gr\xE6ca fides. Pointedly as I taxed the brotherhood with falsehood, they\
        \ quietly submitted to the accusation. The prior is a native of Crete ; St.Paul's\
        \ notorious character of the Cretes (the Cretes are always liars) he seems\
        \ to verify, even in the present day. I now believe that the manuscript for\
        \ which Lord Prudhoe offered some years ago two hun dred and fifty pounds,\
        \ and which was not accepted only because they could not agree about the division\
        \ of the proceeds, has really been sold to the English. As it would be a disgrace\
        \ to the monastery, they fancy, they dare not admit it. But if it be in England,\
        \ I wish Chris tian literature joy of the acquisition of the new treasure\
        \ ; for, that it may be speedily communicated to the real Christian church,\
        \ is a wish towards whose fulfilment erudite men are doubtlessly already labouring.\
        \ I was told of another very interesting document ; it is said to con sist\
        \ of the original deed of foundation of the monastery by Justinian. Its existence\
        \ is possible enough. To my astonishment I discovered amongst the Greek manuscripts\
        \ which I brought home, a document with the superscription \" Golden Bull\
        \ which the celebrated Emperor Justinian gave to theAbbey of the Monastery\
        \ of the Holy Mount Sinai.\" This may be the copy of an original deed, although\
        \ by no means may it be called a title-deed. I shall not defer its publication.\
        \ But this is not the place for an account of my own labours respecting the\
        \ MSS. in the monastery, and I shall merely mention that I found in a modern\
        \ Greek manuscript treatises upon astrology, natural history, medicine, and\
        \ other similar studies, treated of in a peculiar manner. Under an article\
        \ headed \" Upon the Eagle,\" it is stated that the heart when dressed and\

        written in three columns, an anti quity of more than a thousand years. But
        I was chiefly occupied with the alleged exceedingly ancient manuscript which
        is said to contain a statement to the effect, that it was written thirteen
        years after the death of Moses, by Abischua, the son of Phineas, who was grandson
        of Aaron. The rabbin brought us a tin case, within which lay the manuscript
        bke a large synagogue roll of parchment, enveloped in a costly covering of
        crimson silk with embroidered golden letters. It bears undeniable traces of
        antiquity. I examined the parchment, the colour of the ink, the system of
        the lines, the punctuation, the divisions, none of which have initials, and
        the characters, as well as they could be examined without a knowledge of the
        Samaritan. All combine to convey the idea of a manuscript of the sixth century.
        Even under this supposition it necessarily holds a very distinguished rank
        among all the ancient parchment codices of both the East and the West. With
        respect to the alleged statement it may not, if in fact it exist, be considered
        otherwise than as a transcript carelessly copied from former documents, and
        incorporated in it as a note founded on a remote tradition. Perhaps this Abischua
        took some share in writing the original Pentateuch. In that case the statement
        in question would receive some elucidation from the practice in the Greek
        manuscripts of the Gospel, wherein is frequently noted that it was written
        by Matthew, by John, &c, as well as the year in which it was first promulgated.
        These notices have misled uninformed persons. For instance, I found in a celebrated
        library, inscribed in a manuscript of the Gospel, a remark from the pen of
        the librarian himself, to the effect that the manuscript was written by the
        rheto rician Hebraides, in the tenth century after Christ''s ascension, and
        referred to an ancient commentary. But what stood in this com mentary ? Nothing
        more than that the Gospel of St. Matthew was published ten years after Christ''s
        ascension, antl that in the Hebrew tongue.* But I return to the Samaritans
        at Naplus. I do not believe that it would be impossible to obtain their manuscripts,
        and I feel con vinced that thereby a precious treasure would be gained for
        even the largest library in Europe. * On this occasion I must mention what
        will probably be new to my readers ; an exceedingly remarkable original manuscript
        that has recently been resuscitated from the grave of oblivion. This is nothing
        less than the Hebrew original manuscript of the inscription of Pilate over
        the cross of Jesus. It is well known that the holy wooden cross itself has
        long been preserved at Rome. A learned propagandist of the house of Israel
        made the remarkable discovery upon it, and immediately communicated it to
        the world with commentary and sac-simile. He himself showed me his disser
        tation upon it, but to my regret he gave me no copy of it.', 1]

        study. The superior also introduced to me, as my ordinary companion during
        my stay in the monastery, a young man, who wore nothing but a short hair garment,
        striped with brown ?nd grey. I soon perceived that I had to do with a half-witted
        fellow : the first question he asked me was, if I had already travelled in
        the sun and moon. This " Signor Pietro" is a native Greek, of a good family
        : he speaks, besides Italian and French, a little English, German, and Arabic.
        Some few years since his relatives conveyed him to the monastery to be taken
        care of, and he daily awaits their return in vain. Not withstanding his mad
        capriccios, he is doubtlessly one of the most witty and intellectual individuals
        in the monastery. His society was interesting to me, although he was occasionally
        a bore. Next to me dwelt a brother of the name of Gregorius, a friendly venerable
        man, with a stately white beard : to him the waiting upon strangers was confided.
        Forty years previously he had been the commander of a thousand Mamelukes :
        like a Rhodian knight of St. John, he had withdrawn from the din of war to
        this humble office in the tranquil monastery. He looked the soldier the instant
        he saw arms : almost daily he shot with my double-barrelled gun, amid the
        thunder of repeated echoes ; and usually hit a tile which was placed as a
        mark against the cloister wall. He also possessed suffi cient literary zest
        to take interest in my enthusiasm for Greek manuscripts. My windows, which

        me in the full nakedness of its grev granite and in its terrific ruggedness.
        Yet a few solitary crucifixes glanced downward from the heights : nothing
        was too rugged, nothing too daunting to the pious enthusiasm of the hermits.
        Upon stepping forth from the door of my chamber I saw the court beneath me,
        with a fountain in its centre, and surrounded by the luxuriant foliage of
        a green vine. Between four and five in the morning, when the little bell had
        already rung, I invariably saw by the side of the fountain the worthy brother
        Cyrillus. This fountain, with its vine and the good Cyrillus, are still present
        to my eyes. With this man, who is between forty and fifty years of age, I
        be came exceedingly intimate. He had first located himself upon .Mount Athos
        ; but, a short time since, he was brought by force to Sinai for some unexplained
        act of insubordination towards the patriarch. He is here the librarian. I
        have learned to esteem him as an honest, well-informed, serious, benevolent
        man. During the latter days of my residence in the monastery, whenever I met
        him he surprised me with a neat Romaic poem, which he had composed hi honour
        of my self, and transcribed upon embellished paper. He allowed me the', 1]

        \ is occupied by an equestrian statue of Charles I., in bronze, executed in\
        \ 1633, by Le Sceur, for the earl of Arun del. During the civil wars it fell\
        \ into the hands of the parliament, by whom it was ordered to be sold and\
        \ broken up. The purchaser, John River, a brazier, produced some pieces of\
        \ broken brass, in token of his having complied with the conditions of sale\
        \ ; and he sold to the cavaliers the handles of knives and forks as made from\
        \ the statue: River deceived both the parliament and the loyalists \u2014\
        \ sor he had buried the statue unmutilated. At the restoration of Charles\
        \ II. he dug it up, and sold it to the government ; and Grinlin Gibbon executed\
        \ a stone pedestal, seventeen feet high, upon which it was placed and still\
        \ remains. It has been customary on the 29th of May, the anniversary ofthe\
        \ restoration, to dress the statue with oaken boughs. Malmesbury Market-Cross,\
        \ represented in the engraving, siauds nearly in the cen tre ofthe town. Of\
        \ this the late Mr. Cobbett says, in his \"Rural Rides:\" \" There is a market\
        \ cross in this town, the sight of which is worth a journey of hundreds of\
        \ miles to see.\" Without going so far, however, it may be admitted to be\
        \ an interest ing architectural relic. It is an octangular stone building,\
        \ with flying buttresses, and a richly-ornamented turret, which is also octangular,\
        \ with a small niche on each side, filled with figures in basso-relievo, one\
        \ of which represents the crucifixion. Leland says : \" There is a right,\
        \ fair, and costly piece of workmanship in the market place, made all of stone,\
        \ and curiously vaulted for poor market-folks to stand dry when rain cometh.\
        \ There be eight great pillars, and eight open arches, and the work is eight\
        \ square. One great pillar in the middle bearelh up the vault. The men of\
        \ the town made this piece of work ' in hominum memoria,' that is, within\
        \ the memory of man, or in the recollection ofthe existing generation.\" Leland\
        \ wrote his \" Itinerary\" in the reign of Henry VIII. \" The cross was substantially\
        \ repaired,\" says Mr. Britton, \" by the late earl of Suffolk and Lady Northwick,\
        \ about twenty years ago,\" that is, prior to 1825. The town of Malmesbury\
        \ was one of the earliest of the incorporated boroughs of England, and was\
        \ also early distinguished as a place of trade. It has produced sev eral celebrated\
        \ literary characters, among whom may be mentioned William of Malmesbury,\
        \ so called either because he was born in the town (which is uncertain), or\
        \ (which is the most probable supposition) from his connexion with the abbey,\
        \ of which he was for many years the precentor and librarian. This monkish\

        \ held on them. Here is an excellent hotel, a good inn, and four other public\
        \ houses, besides several commodious lodging houses, for the accommodation\
        \ of the numerous visitors who frequent this place during the summer months.\
        \ A suite of hot, cold, and vapour baths was erected here in 1835, at a cost\
        \ of \xA31800., raised in shares of \xA35. each. In the same building are\

        \ volume. Richard, surnamed from his birth-place Richard of Cirencester, flourished\
        \ from the middle to the latter end of the fourteenth century. No traces of\
        \ his Family or connections can be discovered ; though they were at least\
        \ of respectable condition, for he received an education which in his time\
        \ was far beyond the attainment of the lowest ranks of society. In 1350 he\
        \ entered into the Benedictine monastery of St. Peter, Westminster, during\
        \ the abbacy of de Lytlington, as appears from the rolls of the abbey ; and\

        our work. We are, nevertheless, sufficiently aware that it is in many respects
        defective ; but had we deferred its publication till these defects were removed,
        it would never have appeared. Some of them are in herent in the nature of
        the subject ; and though additional experience and observation might afford
        the means of obviating others, new defi ciencies would be sure to disclose
        themselves in the interval. Per fection is as unattainable in works of this
        description as in other things. We have, however, done our best, with the
        assistance of such means and instruments as we could command, faithfully to
        represent the state of the country ; and by exhibiting the principal circumstances
        which have contributed to accelerate and to retard its progress in wealth
        and refinement, to show how its advancement, and the well-being of the population,
        may be best provided for in time to come. Unless they are made subservient
        to this end, descriptive and statistical details are of comparatively little
        value. In those departments of the work in which the author was but little
        familiar, he sought the co-operation of others. Thus the articles on the geology
        of England, Scotland, and Ireland, were contributed to the first edition of
        the work by the late Mr. Bakewell ; and they have been revised and mostly
        rewritten for this edition by Sir Henry de la Beche and Mr. Maclaren. The
        article on the climate of England is by Dr. Copeland, the learned author of
        the Medical Dic tionary ; and that on botany is by Sir William Jackson Hooker.
        The article on zoology was written for the first edition by William Swain
        son, Esq. ; but it required and has received much alteration in this edition.
        The chapters in the former editions on the English constitution and courts
        of law, were contributed by F. Forster, Esq., A.M., Barrister-at- Law. Except,
        however, in mere matters of detail, the chapters on these important subjects
        in this edition have very little in common with those of Mr. Forster, who
        is no longer in any degree responsible for them. William Farr, Esq., of the
        office of the Registrar-General, is the author of the elaborate and very valuable
        article on Vital Statistics. Dr. Irving, Librarian to the Faculty of Advocates,
        Edinburgh, has contributed the chapter on the Origin and Progress of the English
        Language. We have also been greatly indebted to other parties. Our esteemed
        friend Mr. G. C. Lewis, procured for us many important statements ;', 1]
    - ["PREFACE. In the preface to the first edition of this work we made the following\
        \ statements : \u2014 \" It has long been matter of surprise and regret to\
        \ many, that there should be no modern work exhibiting, within a moderate\
        \ compass, the physical capacities, population, industry, and institutions\
        \ of the British empire. The latest work of the kind that has attracted any\
        \ notice is the State of Great Britain and Ireland, by Chamberlayne, the last\
        \ edition of which was published so far back as the reign of George II* But,\
        \ though this once popular publication contains a good deal of useful information,\
        \ it is not written on any scientific plan, nor with any considerable discrimination\
        \ ; while the change of circumstances, since the peace of Paris, in 1763,\
        \ would have rendered it, how good soever it might oiiginally have been, quite\
        \ obsolete for many years past. The want of any separate publication on the\
        \ state of the empire has been but indifferently supplied by the notices of\
        \ it in other works. Speaking generally, geographical science in this country\
        \ has been, until very recently, at the lowest ebb, while during the long\
        \ interval between Sir William Petty and Dr. Beeke, statistical science could\
        \ hardly be said to exist. Hence the accounts of Great Britain and Ireland,\
        \ in our encyclop\xE6dias and geographical works, are, for the most part,\
        \ very meagre and defective. The article on England in the Edinburgh Encyclop\xE6\
        dia, written by the late William Stevenson, Esq., Librarian to the Treasury,\
        \ is undoubtedly the best of this class of publications. The space allotted\
        \ to it was, however, tpo confined ; so that some important subjects, such\
        \ as those relating to population, education, the poor, revenue and expenditure,\
        \ army and navy, &c, are disposed of in the briefest and most unsatisfactory\
        \ manner. The accounts of agriculture and manufactures are the best parts\
        \ of the article, and are superior to any that had appeared when it was printed\
        \ in 1815.", 1]

        near Boston, and was educated at Cam bridge, where he received the degree
        of Ba chelor of Arts in 1804. He subsequently studied divinity, but never
        became a settled clergyman. He was for a time tutor in Bow doin College, and
        in 1811 was appointed tutor and librarian in Harvard FJriiversity, in which
        he succeeded William Ellery Channing as lecturer on biblical criticism, in
        1813, and upon the new organization of the theological department, in 1819,
        was made the first Dex ter Professor of Sacred Literature, which office he
        held until compelled by ill health to resign it in 1830. During all this period
        Mr. Nor ton was a close student, and besides the ordi nary advantages of American
        scholars he had the intimate friendship of many learned men, and the constant
        use of the best library on the continent. His attainments were not merely
        scholastic. The cultivation of his taste and un derstanding was as remarkable
        as the compass of his classical studies. There were few sub jects of metaphysics
        with which he was not familiar, and he could turn from the driest dis quisition
        to discuss with equal discrimination the last new poem or romance. Although
        the subject of this work has been so fruitful of discussion for many centuries,
        Mr. Norton''s treatment of it is eminently ori ginal both in positions and
        in scope and man ner of argument. The edifice of Christian evidence he has
        entirely reconstructed. His object appears to be not so much to combat infidels,
        popularly so called, as a class of nominally Christian critics, most common
        in Germany, who as if intent upon astonishing the world with the independence
        of their faith, proclaim it while endeavouring to batter down all the foundations
        upon which that of others is founded. They admit that Matthew, Mark, and Luke
        were in some sense the authors of the books which are attributed to them,
        but deny that these books are their original, inde pendent, and uncorrupted
        compositions ; and while less doubtful of the genuineness of the gospel of
        John, are not prepared to admit that it is beyond controversy. Mr. Norton
        on the contrary maintains the real Christian doctrine respecting the authorship
        of the gospels, and that they contain true narratives of our Sa viour''s life
        and ministry ; and does this with such copiousness of learning, particularly
        in Greek philosophy and patristic literature ; soundness of judgment as to
        the value of dif ferent kinds of testimony, and closeness and clearness of
        reasoning, that his work may un doubtedly be ranked with Clarke''s, Butler''s,
        Lardner''s, or any other of the gTeat defences of the Christian religion.
        Although while connected with the uni versity Mr. Norton wrote many articles
        for the literary and theological journals, and in the same period published
        several tracts, and in every thing displayed exact and compre hensive learning,
        and a style singularly clear, compact, and beautiful, yet his reputation as
        a man of letters and as a theologian rests chiefly upon his Evidences of the
        Genuineness of the Gospels, to which he has devoted nearly half of his life,

        \ Leif's return be came the principal subject of conversation. The next adventurer\
        \ was Thorwald, his brother. And you will observe that he and the other navigators\
        \ gave the same account of places they visited. Were not this the case, who\
        \ could believe any of their reports ? Thorwold, thinking the country had\
        \ not been sufficiently explored, set sail in 1002, and proceeded to Leifsbuthir,\
        \ where he lived till 1004. In the spring of 1 004, he sailed from Leifsbuthir.\
        \ After passing along the shore of the promontory; East and North, they sailed\
        \ round a sharp point of land, called Kjarlanes. This must have been Cape\
        \ Cod. Kjarlanes implies Keel-cape. For Cape Cod at the extremity, is in the\
        \ shape of the keel of ancient vessels, which curved inward. These Northmen\
        \ were peaceable men. They were not like Ph\xE6ton, who would gladly have\
        \ seized the reins of the chariot of the sun to set the world on fire. It\
        \ must not be denied, however, that the second great navigator, Thorwold,\
        \ assailed the natives without a cause : but in using the sword he perished\
        \ by the sword. On receiving a mortal wound, he requested that after his death,\
        \ crosses might be placed at either end of his grave. The Catholic ministers\
        \ in giving an account of their first mission ary labors in this country,\
        \ speak of the custom of the natives in wear ing crosses. Such must have been\
        \ introduced by the Northman Christians. . I mentioned this circumstance lately\
        \ to the librarian of the Amer ican Antiquarian Society, Worcester ; and he\
        \ said that a cross had been sent to that institution by a gentleman of Ohio.\
        \ I saw this emblem of the Christian faith. It must have been hid from the\
        \ light of heaven for centuries. This silver cross is about two and a half\
        \ inches long. It was found on the breast of a female skeleton, one of which\
        \ was dug from a mound at Columbus, over which a forest of trees had grown.\
        \ On this cross the capital letters I. S. are perfectly visible. And what\
        \ can these letters imply, but the initials of the sa cred name, Iesus Salvator\
        \ ? Who can doubt, then, that the \" Sun of Righteousness\" cast his bright\
        \ beams on the land west of the dread Atlantic, long before the time of Columbus.\

        \ says that the fact of this early discovery was well known to the Icelanders\
        \ \u2014 that it was authenticated by Northern historians. It is a remarkable\
        \ fact, that Iceland, where these documents relating to the early dis covery\
        \ were preserved, was the Athens of the North, during the Dark Ages. During\
        \ the Middle Ages, the Icelanders were the most intelligent people in the\
        \ North. Even now, as Henderson says, youth can repeat passages from Latin\
        \ and Greek authors, who have never been but a few miles from the place of\
        \ their birth. Truly, the hardy Icelanders were our librarians and historians.\
        \ Iceland appears to have been a medium of communication between Norway and\
        \ Greenland \u2014 a stepping stone, as it were, from one conti nent to another.\
        \ Iceland, thought by some to be the \" Ultima Thule\" of Virgil, was discovered\
        \ by the Norwegians in S61. The oppression of King Har old Harfaga drove them\
        \ there for an asylum. But the restless spirit of the Northmen would not allow\
        \ them to be idle. They made incursions in every direction, and discovered\
        \ Green land in 984. In 9S6, a colony was begun by Eric the Red. This was\
        \ at length destroyed. By the exertions of the Danish Society, the ruins of\
        \ this settlement have been discovered. It was located on the West, near Cape\
        \ Farwell. It is seen in the remains of churches and buildings. Lief, the\
        \ .son of Eric, commenced a voyage of discovery in the year 1000. His crew\
        \ consisted of thirty-five men. Lief was the first to introduce missionaries\
        \ into Greenland. After sailing some time southwest, the^ made land. They\
        \ anchored and went ashore. This place was destitute of grass, and was covered\
        \ with a slaty rock, which they called Helluland. This is supposed to be Labrador.\
        \ Fishermen and travelers of the present day give a like description of that\
        \ barren region. From thence they sailed southwardly ; and after holding on\
        \ for some time, they again made land and went ashore. This country was level,\
        \ had a low coast, presenting, here and there, bluffs of white sand, and was\
        \ thickly covered with wood. This they named Mark land, or Woodland. This\
        \ is thought to be Nova Scotia. Leaving Markland, they sailed south-westerly,\
        \ with a fair wind, two days before seeing land again, when they passed down\
        \ a promon tory, probably the east side of Cape Cod, stretching east and north\
        \ ; and then turning west between an island (Martha's Vineyard) and the main\
        \ land, they entered a bay (Narragansett Bay) through which a river (Taunton\
        \ River) flowed, when they came to anchor and went ashore. Resolving to spend\
        \ the winter here they called the place Leifsbuthir, or place of booths. Here,\

        \ obtain a last interview, and with difficulty escaped the clutch ofthe soldiers.\
        \ Robert became a stu- dent of theology under his father, and was chosen librarian\
        \ to the College. He soon displayed a talent for historical and biographical\
        \ inquiry. The study of natural history also attracted his at- tention in\
        \ no ordinary degree. On finishing his theological studies, Mr Wodrow lest\

        \ was licensed to preach in 1703. In the summer following he was ordained\

        \ Although discharg- ing his duties as a minister, both in his parish and\

        \ of this work, and the correspondence relating to it, we must refer to the\
        \ memoir by Dr Burns, who enters fully into the subject. Mr Wodrow married,\
        \ in 1708, Mar- garet, daughter of the Rev. Patrick Warner of Ardeer, minister\
        \ of Irvine. Her mother was a daughter of the celebrated Mr Guthrie of Fen-\

        \ from the charge in bad health. He was twice married, and had six or seven\
        \ children. His eldest son settled in the United States of America ; and about\
        \ thirty years ago, the only surviving daughter went there also with her family.\

        \ and left four daughters, one of whom married the Rev. Mr Inglis, who succeeded\
        \ her father. Of the other sons, Alexander settled in America, along with\

        of American scholars he had the intimate friendship of many learned men, and
        the constant use of the best library on the continent. His attainments w*ere
        not merely scholastic. The cultivation of his taste and un derstanding was
        as remarkable as the compass of his classical studies. There were few sub
        jects of metaphysics with which he was not familiar, and he could turn from
        the driest dis quisition to discuss with equal discrimination the last new
        poem or romance. Although the subject of this work has been so fruitful of
        discussion for many centuries, Mr. Norton''s treatment of it is eminently
        ori ginal both in positions and in scope and man ner of argument. The edifice
        of Christian evidence he has entirely reconstructed. His object appears to
        be not so much to combat infidels, popularly so called, as a class of nominally
        Christian critics, most common in Germany, who as if intent upon astonishing
        the world with the independence of their faith, proclaim it while endeavouring
        to batter down all the foundations upon which that of others is founded. They
        admit that Matthew, Mark, and Luke were in some sense the authors of the books
        which are attributed to them, but deny that these books are their original,
        inde pendent, and uncorrupted compositions ; and while less doubtful of the
        genuineness of the gospel of John, are not prepared to admit that it is beyond
        controversy. Mr. Norton on the contrary maintains the real Christian doctrine
        respecting the authorship of the gospels, and that they contain true narratives
        of our Sa viour''s life and ministry ; and does this with such copiousness
        of learning, particularly in Greek philosophy and patristic literature ; soundness
        of judgment as to the value of dif ferent kinds of testimony, and closeness
        and clearness of reasoning, that his work may un doubtedly be ranked with
        Clarke''s, Butler''s, Lardner''s, or any other of the great defences of the
        Christian religion. Although while connected with the uni versity Mr. Norton
        wrote many articles for the literary and theological journals, and in the
        same period published several tracts, and in every thing displayed exact and
        compre hensive learning, and a style singularly clear, compact, and beautiful,
        yet his reputation as a man of letters and as a theologian rests chiefly upon
        his Evidences of the Genuineness of the Gospels, to which he has devoted nearly
        half of his life, a longer time than has been given to the composition of
        any other work in Ame rican literature. The first volume appeared in 1837,
        eight years after its commencement, and the second and third in 1844. In these
        are comprised the historical proofs that the gospels were actually written
        by the persons whose names they bear, and in a fourth vo lume he proposes
        to discuss the internal evi dence of the same fact. 236 Mr. Norton has some
        opinions not held by the mass of Christian scholars, but whatever may be thought
        of them, he must be respected for the deliberation with which they were formed
        and are published. They are con tained in his dissertation on the Old Testa
        ment, in the remarks prefatory to which he observes, that it seems to him
        "a weighty offence against society to advance and main tain opinions on any
        important subject con nected with religion without carefully weigh ing them,
        and without feeling assured, as far as may be, that we shall find no reason
        to change our belief." The views to which', 1]

    - ["37 Very fortunately the Feoffees and librarians did not follow the advice\
        \ of the Historian of Formosa. And hence it is that the library possesses\
        \ a collection of MSS., few in number, indeed, but of great value. The records\
        \ cf their acquisition are sparse and meagre \u2014 whether from the fear\
        \ of critical censure, or from any other cause \u2014 so that the history\
        \ of some of thc most curious of them cannot now bo traced. Some description\
        \ of the most noteworthy will be here after attempted. But it must also be\
        \ remarked that thc purchases of printed books appear to be very irregularly\
        \ entered, subsequently to the year 1743. Such entries as appear relate chiefly\
        \ to the acquisition of costly and valuable works in Topography and Natural\
        \ History, especially between the years 1778 and 1787. At this period, for\
        \ example, it is recorded \xA358 was given for Boydoll's Shakspeare ; \xA3\
        20 7s. for Martin's Universal Conchologist ; \xA320 15s. for a set of Hogarth's\
        \ Works; and \xA327 10s. for \" 100 drawings of birds by Mr. Abbott, of Savannah,\
        \ in Georgia,\" afterwards bound into volumes. In 1791 a catalogue* of the\
        \ library was prepared and published hythe Reverend John Radcliffe, M. A.,\
        \ the then librarian (afterwards, I believe, Rector of Limehouse, near London).\
        \ This catalogue is arranged under the following five principal classes :\
        \ I. TlIEOLOGIA. IV. SciENTT\xC6 ET ARTES. V. LlTER\xC6 HUMANIORES. II. JURISPRUDENTIA.\
        \ III. HlSTORIA. Under this arrangement, thc first class includes Canon Law,\
        \ but not Ecclesiastical History. Politics and Commerce form a subdivi sion\
        \ of History ; and Philosophy is the first subdivision of Science and Arts.\
        \ The total number of separate entries in these two volumes is, of printed\
        \ works, 6,679, and of MSS. 44. But, as collections of several treatises bound\
        \ together, and collections of tracts on any one subject \u2014 whatever the\
        \ number of pieces, or of volumes, \u2014 respectively appear only as single\
        \ entries, that number does not represent the total of distinct printed works\
        \ which the library then contained. These appear to have amounted to about\
        \ 7,160, and the number of volumes to 11,497. The catalogue was, in some respects,\
        \ carefully compiled, and contains many useful notes and references. To this\
        \ catalogue a supplement was jmblished in 1820, by the Rev. William Parr Greswcll\
        \ (thc author of the \" Annals of Parisian Typography,\" &c.),who was especially\
        \ employed by the Feoffees in its compilation. Mr. Greswell included in his\
        \ task the preparation of indexes to the preceding volumes, as well as to\
        \ his own, but (for what reason it is hard to guess) printed the index of\
        \ each volume separately. The total number of entries in the supplement, is,\
        \ of printed works, 1,255, and of MSS., 51. The total number of volumes *\

    - ["41 By the exertions of the present learned and zealous librarian, Mr. Thomas\
        \ Jones (appointed in 1851), a marked improvement has begun, but his task\
        \ has been sadly up-hill ! By dint of unwearied application to the principal\
        \ publishing societies of the United King- dom, and to many individual authors\
        \ \u2014 more especially to such as are of the clergy of the Church of England\
        \ \u2014 he has succeeded in obtaining, during nine years, 850 volumes by\
        \ donation. Whilst, on the other hand, by earnestly pressing on the attention\
        \ of thc Feoffees the importance of completing some ofthe many valuable but\
        \ imperfect works already in the library, as well as of adding a few of the\
        \ most indispensable recent works, he has obtained by purchase, during the\
        \ same period, about 990 volumes, at a cost of \xA3412. This, however, shows\
        \ a yearly outlay on books (exclusive of that on the binding and repairing\
        \ of old works) of but \xA315 a year ; whilst, almost at the very foundation\
        \ of the library, at least \xA350 a year (equal to a much larger sum of our\
        \ present currency), if we may trust the state- ments of De Foe and Psalmanazar,\
        \ was available for that purpose. But whether these statements be in detail\
        \ accurate or inac- curate; \u2014 whether we are to take them as extracts\
        \ from the note- books of honest travellers, or to class them with the imaginary\
        \ biographies of the one author, and the fabulous history of tho other ; \u2014\
        \ it has, at all events, been made perfectly clear that the growth and progress\
        \ of the Library of our benefactor have kept no sort of pace with the growth\
        \ aud progress of his Hospital. The plain fact is, that the library has, in\
        \ past times, been starved in order that its more fortunate foster-brother\
        \ might the better thrive. Minds of all shapes and sizes can sec the importance\
        \ and value of a School, especially if thc children in it be tricked out in\
        \ a conspicuous livery, and plentifully bo-ticketed aud be-badged. But the\
        \ worth of a Library is not so salient. The dead worthies, who in close serried\
        \ ranks occupy its shelves, \u2014 often in wrappings whicli smack but too\
        \ strongly of the grave, \u2014 are to some ears dumb, and to some eyes unlovely.\
        \ Here, in a special sense, it is always true that the car hears and the eyes\
        \ see but what they bring. The contrast, in point of prosperity, between \"\
        Hospital\" and \"Library,\" whilst under the same management, would be quite\
        \ a marvel but for this. The best chance of improvement in thc condition aud\
        \ public useful- ness of thc Library lies in its severance altogether from\
        \ the Hospital. And this, I believe, could be so effected as at once to carry\
        \ out all the intentions of the founder far more efficiently than they have\
        \ been carried out hitherto; to exonerate tho trustees from a portion of their\
        \ task to which their resources have ceased to be adequate, and to confer\
        \ a great and lasting benefit on thc city of Manchester. By tho amended Public\
        \ Libraries Act of 1855, all corporate towns in England, having a population\
        \ of 5,000, are empowered to establish and maintain public libraries, by levying\
        \ a rate, not exceeding one penny in the pound, on the property in such towns\
        \ already assessa ble to the borough rate, and such libraries once established\
        \ are for ever inalienable. Similar powers are also given to certain other\
        \ classes of towns, and to parishes, under regulations which are described\
        \ in the note appended to this chapter. i>", 1]
    - ["55 the assertion that the Chetham Library is a noble monument of its founder's\
        \ munificence and public spirit, notwithstanding the hin drances to its proper\
        \ development, which have arisen from its pinched means, and its unfortunate\
        \ position as an appendage to the Hospital. That the separation of the two\
        \ institutions would conduce to the prosperity of both, I am deeply convinced.\
        \ There is conclusive evidence that Chetham intended his library to be for\
        \ the benefit of the whole \" town of Manchester.\" In his da)', that object\
        \ was best attained by providing a learned library \"fin- scholars,\" and\
        \ an English library for \" the edification of the common people.\" In our\
        \ day, such a divarication, in a provincial city, has ceased to be either\
        \ useful or practicable. If further illustration be needed of the advantages\
        \ wliich would result from that incorporation of the two libraries which I\
        \ advocate, it will be afforded by thc statement, that of works in those classes\
        \ wliich have been particularised as indicating the wealth of the Chetham\
        \ Library \u2014 invaluable as they are \u2014 and of Manuscripts, the Eree\
        \ Library is, as yet, very deficient ; whilst, with modern collec tions, and\
        \ more recent authors, the Chetham Library is almost equally unprovided. The\
        \ former (as respects its Reference Department), with every passing year,-\
        \ is becoming more and more a library for all classes, both of readers and\
        \ students; because, great as are its deficiencies in such books as have been\
        \ mentioned, as well as in books of many other classes, it possesses the foundation\
        \ of a noble collection, as well of British History,* as of the literature\
        \ of Commerce. The latter is becoming less and less useful, with every passing\
        \ year, to any class, either of readers cr of students ; because, rich as\
        \ are its stores, every month sees it falling more and more into the rear\
        \ of the science and the literature of our own age. The Free Library is yet\
        \ in its cradle; but some, at all events, of its limbs are acquiring consistency\
        \ and vigour. The Chetham Library can look back upon a long careers of usefulness,\
        \ to which many * In the formation ofthe Manchester Free Library, special\
        \ attention has been paid to the general history of the British Empire; but\
        \ its topography is very meagrely supplied. Books in this class are.'as is\
        \ well known, of a most costly kind. Yet our Free Libraries ou\"ht eminently\
        \ to aim at becoming local storehouses, in which every sort of information\
        \ respecting at least the county to which they belong \u2014 whether historical,\
        \ statistical, or merely descriptive \u2014 should become accessible to all\
        \ inquirers. In this way that desire of our old antiquary, Leland, that every\
        \ county should have its special library, might be nobly realised The Chetham\
        \ Library has some fine collections of this kind, both printed and manuscript;\
        \ but these are falling into just the same sort of arrear that I have noticed\
        \ in other departments. In not a few cases, tbo books that would best elucidate\

        \ Act of 1850, was the Free Library of Manchester, the foun dation of which\
        \ was laid by a public subscription of almost unpre cedented liberality (originated\
        \ by Sir John Potter, then Mayor of the Borough), and the working 'of which\
        \ has been successful to a degree heretofore without example in any town within\
        \ the United Kingdom. With a collection of printed books, which now exceeds\
        \ 28,000 volumes (brought together by donation and by purchase within four\
        \ years), there has been an aggregate issue of books in this library, to readers\
        \ of every class or society, amounting, in less-than three years, to 400,000\
        \ volumes. Notwithstanding this great issue, but twelve volumes have been\
        \ lost to the library from any cause Avhatever, yet the reference department\
        \ is, of course, unrestrictedly open to all comers, and its lending department\
        \ is freely accessible to all who can produce a voucher or \" guarantee \"\
        \ from two burgesses. The Reference Collection includes an extraordinary assemblage\
        \ of Books and Tracts in all languages, ou political and commercial sub jects,\
        \ extending already to upwards of 15,000 separate publications, dating from\
        \ the middle of thc sixteenth to the middle of thc nine teenth century, and\
        \ including tho best portions of the celebrated collections of Nicholas Magens,\

        \ Lords Bexlcy and Langdale, of Mr. Drummond Hay, of Mr. William Mellish,\
        \ of Mr. Francis Place (ofthe Political Economy Club), and of several other\
        \ well known collectors. The average daily number of readers, since the opening,\
        \ in thc reference department of this library, has exceeded 200. At the Chetham\
        \ Library, the average daily number of readers, five years ago, was twenty-five\
        \ ; it has now dwindled to less than ten. In brief, it may be said, that more\
        \ use has been made of the books in the Free Library, within three years,\
        \ than has been made of those in the Chetham Library within eighty years ;\
        \ yet the first-named collection bas lost twelve volumes from its lending\
        \ department and none from its refer ence department, and thc other has lost\
        \ one hundred and fifty,* as stated in the valuable evidence given by the\
        \ present librarian to the Libraries Committee of 1849. If these facts could\
        \ be placed before a resuscitated Humphrey Chetham \u2014 shrewd, business-like,\

  - - ['276 WINDS. spoken of by the old writers of antiquity. A celebrated modern
        traveller, M. Thevenot, librarian to the king of France, states, that, when
        he journeyed from the Isthmus of Suez to Cairo, some time about the end of
        the seventeenth century, he was greatly annoyed by one of these hot winds,
        which lasted for a whole day, and that the caravan travelling to Mecca was
        so infested by one the year before, that they lost 2000 men in a single night.
        A very singular instance of the direful malignity of thesd winds happened
        in the year 1712, when two French gentlemen determined to travel in the month
        of July from Gambroon, a port on the east of the Persian Gulf, to Ispahan,
        though warned of the consequences that were likely to result at that season
        of the year. The method which travellers pursue, is to set out about three
        o''clock in the morning, and to continue their journey till nine. This plan
        was followed by the party, who, being weary and fatigued with their morning''s
        march, and- having arrived at a caravansary, a kind of lodging or resting
        place found at every stage of fifteen miles in many parts of the east, they,
        gave orders to their servants to make their beds ready (for even such necessary
        furniture travellers are obliged to carry along with them, on camels or horses),
        directing that they should be called at dinner time. After having had a sheet
        dipped in water placed over each bed to cool them, they fell asleep) and during
        their slumbers one of these hot pestilential blasts occurred, and, entering
        through the windows of the room, which were unfortunately left open, it scorched
        the two French gentlemen to death. When the servants at the appointed time
        went to call their masters, to their horror and amaze ment they found them
        both deprived of life, and in so dreadful and shocking a state were the bodies,
        that when they attempted to draw off the sheets, they brought with them both
        skin and flesh, leaving a spectacle too awfully disgusting to describe. It
        is fortunate that these winds blow only in a narrow compass, and are also
        soon perceived, so that their baneful effects may be avoided by prostrat ing
        the body flat on the earth until the blast has passed over ; whenever, therefore,
        a man on horseback meets with one of these unwelcome breezes, he instantly
        dismounts, and turning his horse''s tail to the wind, throws him self down
        beside the noble animal, and thus preserves the beast''s life and his own.
        On the western coast of the land of Ham, near Senegal and those parts, are
        certain cold winds, called Harmatans, which are as extraordinary as the burning
        hot blasts so prevalent along the eastern shores of that once fertile, but
        now desolate, quarter of the globe. These breezes are thought to be produced
        through the trade Winds being interrupted in their course, as they pass over
        the deserts of Africa. They in general occur between the months of December
        and March. Though they are seldom accompanied with fogs, yet, during their
        continuance, the air is raw, moist, and cold, which often checks perspiration
        to a very serious and dangerous extent, rendering the', 1]

        \ loaves might be expected at any time. From these dreams of a political Elysium\
        \ they were doomed to awake plain New England farmers ; and, on the 1st of\
        \ March, 1784, in town meeting, they thus voted : \" That the guns and gunlocks,\
        \ axes, pickaxes, spades, shovels, and lead, belonging to the town, be sold\
        \ at public auction.\" When the first gush of republican joy was over, and\
        \ the town became settled in the new ways of freedom, then they began to ask\
        \ how much independence had cost, in pounds, shillings, and pence. To give\
        \ only two specimens of individual zeal in the cause of independence among\
        \ us, we may mention the remark of our first Medford merchant, Benjamin Hall,\
        \ Esq. : \u2014 \" When the struggle began, in 1775, 1 would not have exchanged\
        \ my property for that of any man in Middlesex County ; and now, in 1784,\
        \ I am worth nothing.\" The other case is that of Rev. Edward Brooks. He was\
        \ librarian of Harvard College two years. On the 19th of April, 1775, he hastened\
        \ towards Eexington, and did duty through the day. Lieut. Gould, taken prisoner\
        \ at Concord, was committed to his custody at Medford. He was chaplain in\
        \ the frigate \" Hancock,\" in 1777, when she captured the British frigate\
        \ \" Fox.\" Afterwards, when the \" Hancock \" and \" Fox \" were retaken\
        \ by the British off Halifax, he was carried there as prisoner of war, but\
        \ was soon released. He had not money to give, but he would have given his\
        \ life, to the American cause. He died at Medford, May 6, 1781, aged 48. Medford\
        \ took steps to pay its debts at the earliest pe riod. It was to be done by\
        \ degrees; and, May 12, 1785, they vote thus : \" To raise \xA3400 to defray\
        \ the expenses of the town, and \xA3400 towards sinking the town-debt.\" The\
        \ next year they vote that \" one quarter of the town's debt be paid this\
        \ year.\" They thus continued the wise work of liqui dating all claims against\
        \ their treasury, and, before many years, were free also in this particular.\
        \ Our fathers shared largely in the intense anxiety which pervaded the United\
        \ States, from the declaration of peace in 1783 to the adoption of the Federal\
        \ Constitution in 1788. Though independence was achieved, yet it might prove\

        It consists of a marble quadra-decagon, surmounted by a hand some dome, supported
        by fourteen marble columns, and has thirteen windows. The shelves are placed
        in the intervening spaces. It is tastefully ornamented with gold inscriptions,
        traced by the most celebrated calligraphers of the day: the whole is in character
        with the light and graceful proportions of the mosque to which it is annexed.
        It is situated in the inner court, beyond the mausoleum, close to which stands
        the colossal porphyry sarcophagus, supposed by some to have contained the
        ashes of Constantine. The number of volumes exceeds 2600. Among these are
        two Koorans held in great sanctity, one having been transcribed by Omer, and
        the other by Ali. This library is one of the richest endowments of the city.
        It has three chief and three deputy librarians, who also act as imams in the
        mosque. Great library of the Seraglio, erected in 1767, by Mustafa HI. It
        is a detached building, in that portion of the inner court called Bostangelar
        Bostany, (Bostanjy''s Garden.) It is approached by a double flight of stone
        steps, has a portico and vestibule, and is erected in the shape of an equiformed
        cross : one arm serves for the vestibule, and the other three form re cesses,
        the one occupied by windows and the other by book shelves. A quadrangular
        bookcase stands in the middle, surmounted by a dome, supported by marble columns.
        The external walls are ornamented with kashee, or Persian porcelain tiles,
        blue arabesques on a white ground, with here and there inscriptions upon a
        rarer kind, white on a blue or green ground. The art of making the latter
        seems to have been lost or neg lected ; as it is difficult to procure specimens
        even among the sergetjee, (dealers in antiquities,) whose shops are met with
        out side the Parmak gate of the bazars. This library is more diversified than

        the heads of chapters are frequently adorned with rich devices in gold, ultramarine,
        and other colors. The bookcases of some libraries, that for instance of Raghib
        Pasha, are in the centre of the apartment, and form a square protected by
        wire doors. The whole is surrounded and covered by an external wire fence,
        admitting ample space within for the librarians. The floors are matted, and
        upon one or more sides are low minders (divans) or shilty, (cushions,) upon
        which stu dents seat themselves to read ; whilst a narrow form in front serves
        as a table or rest for the volumes they may require. Such persons as are engaged
        in transcribing works bring their own materials, and, seating themselves upon
        the mats or cushions, employ their knees as desks. Neither fire, candle, nor
        smoking is permitted. These libraries are, for the most part, open every day,
        from nine a.m. till afternoon prayer, except during Ramazan, the two Beirams,
        and Fridays. Upon these occasions, librarians and students consider themselves
        entitled to enjoy repose. Those who are present at mid-day prayer-hour, quit
        their studies and perform their devotions in common, following the guidance
        of the oldest person present, who, in most cases, is a priest. The greatest
        order and most perfect silence prevail. The stu dious are not interrupted
        even by the rustling of slippers, as these articles are always left at the
        entrance. The number of public libraries, including those of the Seraglio,
        which latter can scarcely be so classed, as they are not acces sible to Musselmans
        without express permission, amount to about forty. I will enumerate some of
        the most remarkable in the order of their foundation. Eyoub, founded in 1460,
        by Mohammed II. The impossibility for Franks to obtain permission within the
        precincts of this building, and the little disposition evinced by persons
        connected with it to answer questions, render it difficult to obtain any pre
        cise information as to its contents. The number of volumes, principally brought
        from Broussa, and almost exclusively theo logical, is said to exceed 1100.

        of their palaces. This arrangement is inconvenient to foreigners, who cannot
        visit these edifices without firmans. Even then they are only permitted to
        remain a few minutes. But it was a prudent precaution in a city, where the
        calamities arising from accidental fires were frequently augmented by those
        occasioned by the malevolence of turbulent janissaries. The regulations of
        all imperial libraries, as well as those en dowed by private individuals,
        are nearly similar. Those within or attached to mosques are under the guardianship
        of the church, and those erected in isolated situations are administered by
        the wakoofya. All possess special and ample funds for their pre servation
        and for the salaries of librarians and servants. But it does not appear that
        these funds are employed in adding to these collections ; so that in point
        of numbers they remain nearly in the same state as when first founded. There
        may, however, be some few exceptions, as additions have been occasionally
        made by individuals, and now and then by Sultans. But the latter are, generally
        speaking, more disposed to become founders of new libraries than to augment
        those of predecessors. The officers of each library consist of one or more
        hafizzy kutub, (librarians,) having small fixed salaries, and who, being generally
        expert calligraphers, add to their resources by tran scribing the valuable
        manuscripts under their guardianship. Each library has its simple manuscript
        nomenclature of books, and also a second catalogue (essamy y kutub) containing
        a sum mary or index of the general contents of each work, and forming what
        is called a catalogue raisonne by the French. The latter is advantageous to
        students, who are thus saved much trouble in their researches. The furniture
        is simple and scrupulously clean. The books, invariably placed in bindings
        of dark morocco or calf, with a flap cover, in the form of a clasp pocket-book,
        repose upon their sides. The titles are written upon the outside of the margin,
        and not upon the binding. Al most all works have a second cover, like a map-case,
        as an additional protection against damp and insects. The greater part are
        transcribed upon vellum or highly glazed paper. They 16', 2]

        ble and costly works, splendidly ornamented and illustrated. A magnificent
        edition of Antar, upon metallic paper, and another of the Gulistan, are not
        the least curious. It possesses Koorans, and other works transcribed by divers
        Kaliphs ; and among the curiosities is a collection of portraits of Sultans,
        from Osman, the founder of the dynasty, to Abdoul Hamid. The latter are painted
        somewhat in the form of a genealogical tree, upon a broad roll of canvass.
        This general assemblage of imperial portraits is a copy of the more accurate
        and interesting collec tion, which is bound as a 4to volume, and not only
        contains the portraits of the monarchs and many of their children, but is
        accompanied by a written preface, and a short panegyric of each, inscribed
        upon the opposite blank leaf. This collection is care fully preserved in the
        Sultan''s private library. The number of books in the Seraglio Library, according
        to the assertion of the librarian, amounted to 4440 in June, 1842. The original
        collection, when he came into office, consisted of 6100 ; of these 1660, taken
        from the library of Selim III., and from the small Seraglio library, had been
        removed by the pres ent Sultan. D''Ohsson states the amount of the two Seraglio
        libraries to be about 16,000 in his day. This would seem to be an error, as,
        according to the catalogue, the great library had suffered no other diminution
        than that just mentioned since d''Ohsson wrote, and the books in the small
        library, according to the librarians, never exceeded 3000. A small cabinet,
        or withdrawing-room, annexed to the takht odassy (throne-room) in the same

        \ however fanatic and prejudiced, find their parallel in those upon whom Christianity\
        \ is supposed to have shed its beneficial light. American Protestant missionaries\
        \ and agents of the Bible Societies succeeded, some five years ago, in distributing\
        \ numerous translated copies of the sacred volume among the Christian pop\
        \ ulation of the Lebanon. This at length excited the alarm of the Maronite\
        \ patriarch and clergy ; and, a council having been held, orders were issued\
        \ for the seizure and destruction of all copies. It was suggested, however,\
        \ to the synod by a more rational member of their body, under risk of heterodoxy,\
        \ that it would be worth while to examine the volumes before they were destroyed,\
        \ in order to discover whether they really con tained heretical or objectionable\
        \ matter. A Sardinian gentlemen, of extensive erudition and equal piety, chanced\
        \ at that period to reside among the Maronites for the purpose of studying\
        \ Arabic; he, therefore, was requested to examine and pronounce judgment on\
        \ the contents. Having complied, and carefully scrutinized the pages, he gave\
        \ it as his opinion that the books were not objectionable, and might be preserved,\
        \ seeing that those parts held to be obnoxious by the Church of Rome had been\
        \ carefully expunged in these editions. \" Expunged ! \" exclaimed the patriarch\
        \ and synod in chorus. \" Oh, oh ! they have ventured to make omissions, have\
        \ they ? That is exceedingly reprehensible. How can these blind heretics know\
        \ how to sift chaff from good seed ? Omissions indeed ! That is bad \u2014\

        \ at this logic, and withdrew, and in a few minutes the bibles were carried\

        \ being possessed of a building, as their own property, and vested in trustees.\

        \ its prosperity, through the influence of one of its most energetic supporters,\

        \ Alcuin, in whose time students came from far, to avail themselves of its\

        \ culture of potatoes into this island. have already given my opinion of the\
        \ effects of refine- ment of mind on morals and virtue. Whenever vulgar minds\
        \ begin to shake off the dogmas of the religion in which they have been educated,\
        \ the progress is quick and immediate to downright infidelity ; and nothing\
        \ but refinement of mind can enable them to distinguish between the pure essence\
        \ of religion, and the gross systems which men have been perpetually connecting\
        \ it with. In addition to what has already been done for the education of\
        \ the common people of this coun- try, in the establishment of parish schools,\
        \ I wish to see the salaries augmented in some proportion to the present expense\
        \ of living, and the earnings of the peo- ple of similar rank, endowments,\
        \ and usefulness in society; and I hope that the liberality of the present\
        \ age will be no longer disgraced by refusing, to so use- ful a class of men,\
        \ such encouragement as may make parish schools worth the attention of men\
        \ fitted for tlie important duties of that office. In filling up the vacancies,\
        \ I would have more attention paid to the candidate's capacity of reading\
        \ the English language with grace and propriety ; to his understanding thoroughly,\
        \ and having a high relish for, the beauties of English authors, both in poetry\
        \ and prose; to that good sense and knowledge of human nature, which would\
        \ enable him to acquire some influence on the minds and affections of his\
        \ scholars; to the general worth of his character, and the love of his king\
        \ and country, than to his proficiency in the knowledge of Latin and Greek.\
        \ I would then have a sort of high English class established, not only for\
        \ the purpose of teaching the pupils to read in that graceful and agree- able\
        \ manner that might make them fond of reading, but to make them understand\
        \ what they read, and discover the beauties of the author, in composition\
        \ and sentiment. I would have established, in every parish, a small circulating\
        \ library, consisting of the books which the young people had read extracts\
        \ from in the collections they had read at school, and any other books well\
        \ calculated to refine the mind, improve the moral feelings, recommend the\
        \ practice of virtue, and communicate such knowledge as might be useful and\
        \ suitable to the labouring classes of men. I would have the schoolmaster\
        \ act as librarian, and in recommending books to his young friends, formerly\
        \ his pupils, and letting in the light of them upon their young minds, he\
        \ should have the assistance of the minister. If once such education were\
        \ become general, the low delights of the public house, and other scenes of\
        \ riot and depra- vity, would be contemned and neglected ; while industry,\
        \ order, cleanliness, and every virtue, which taste and independence of mind\
        \ could recommend, would prevail and flourish. Thus, possessed of a virtuous\
        \ and enlight- ened populace, with high delight I should consider my native\
        \ country as at the head of all the nations of the earth, ancient or modern.\
        \ Thus, Sir, have I executed my threat to the fullest extent, in regard to\
        \ the length of my letter. If I had not presumed on doing it more to my liking,\
        \ I should not have undertaken it ; but I have not time to attempt it anew;\
        \ nor, if I would, am I certain that I should succeed any better. I have learned\
        \ to have less confi- dence in my capacity of writing on such subjects. I\
        \ am much obliged by your kind inquiries about my situation and prospects.\
        \ I am much pleased with the soil of this farm, and with tho terms on which\
        \ I possess it. I receive great encouragement likewise in building, enclosing,\
        \ and other conveniences, from my landlord, Perhaps the thing of most importance\
        \ in the education of the common people, is to prevent the intrusion of artificial\
        \ wants. I bless the memory of my worthy father for almost everything in the\
        \ disposi- tions of my mind, and my habits of life, which I can approve of\
        \ : and for none more than the pains he took to impress my mind with the sentiment,\
        \ that nothing was more unworthy the character of a man, than that his happiness\
        \ should in the least depend on what he should eat or drink. So early did\
        \ he impress my mind with this, that although I was as fond of sweetmeats\
        \ as children generally are, yet I seldom laid out any of the halfpence, which\
        \ relations or neighbours gave me at fairs, in the purchase of them; and if\
        \ I did, every mouthful I swallowed was accompanied with shame and remorse;\
        \ and to this hour I never indulge in the use of any delicacy, but I feel\
        \ a considerable degree of self-reproach and alarm for the degradation of\
        \ the human character. Such a habit of thinking I consider as of great consequence,\
        \ both to the virtue and happi- ness of men in the lower ranks of life. \u2014\
        \ And thus, Sir, I am of opinion, that if their minds are early and deeply\
        \ impressed with a sense of the dignity of man, as such; with the love of\
        \ independence and of industry, economy, and temperance, as the most obvious\
        \ means of making themselves independent, and the virtues most becoming their\
        \ situation, and necessary to their happiness; men in the lower ranks of life\
        \ may partake of the pleasures to be derived from the perusal of books calculated\
        \ to improve the mind and refine the taste, without any danger of becoming\
        \ more unhappy in their situation, or discontented with it. Nor do I think\
        \ there is any danger of their becoming less useful. There are some hours\
        \ every day that the most constant labourer is neither at work nor asleep.\
        \ These hours are either appropriated to amusement or to sloth. If a taste\
        \ for employing these hours in reading were cultivated, I do not suppose that\
        \ the return to labour would be more difficult. Every one will allow, that\
        \ the attachment to idle amusements, or even to sloth, has as powerful a tendency\
        \ to abstract men from their proper busi- ness, as the attachment to books;\
        \ while the one dissi- pates the mind, and the other tends to increase its\
        \ powers of self-government. To those who are afraid that the improvement\
        \ of the minds of the com- mon people might be dangerous to the state, or\
        \ to the established order of society, I would remark, that turbulence and\
        \ commotion are certainly very inimical to the feelings of a refined mind.\
        \ Let the matter be brought to the test of experience and obser- vation. Of\
        \ what descriptions of people are mobs and insurrections composed? Are they\
        \ not universally owing to the want of enlargement and improvement of mind\
        \ among the common people? Nay, let any one recollect the characters of those\
        \ who formed the calmer and more deliberate associations, which lately gave\
        \ so much alarm to the government of this country. I suppose few of the common\
        \ people, who were to be found in 6uch societies, had the education and turn\
        \ of mind I have been endeavouring to recommend. Allow me to suggest one reason\
        \ for endeavouring to enlighten the minds of the common people. Their morals\
        \ have hitherto been guarded by a sort of dim religious awe, which, from a\
        \ variety of causes, seems wearing off. I think the alteration in this respect\
        \ considerable, in the short period of my observation. I ccxxii", 1]

        \ He was, however, accompanied by a gen tleman, a particular acquaintance\
        \ of the Duke, by whom the invitation was delivered in all the forms of politeness.\
        \ Tlie invitation came too late ; the pride of Nicol was inflamed into a high\
        \ degree of passion, by the neglect which he had already Buffered. He had\
        \ ordered the hor-.es to be put to the carriage, being determined to proceed\
        \ on his journey alone, and they found him parading the streets of Fochabers,\
        \ before tlie door of the inn, venting his anger on the postillion, for the\
        \ slowness nith which he obeyed ins commands. As no explanation nor entreaty\
        \ could change the purpose of his fellow-traveller, our Poet was reduced to\
        \ the necessity of separating from him ' entirely, or of instantly proceeding\
        \ with him on their journey. He chose the last of these alternatives ; and\
        \ seating himself ' beside Nicol in the post-chaise with mortification and\

        \ some happy days. Sensible, however, of the great kindness of the noble family,\
        \ he made the best ret urn in his power, by composing the above song, which\
        \ he sent to James : Hoy, librarian at Gordon Castle. How much the Poet felt\
        \ the abruptness of his departure, may be gathered from a passage in one of\
        \ his letters to Mr Hoy: \u2014 'I -hall certainly, among my \u25A0 legacies,\

        \ of 'Green grows the rashes,* quoted by Herd. 2 Burns introduced this fine\
        \ lyric to the notice of his brother Gilbert as a production of the olden\

        \ The duke's song, independent totally of his dukeship, charms me.2 There\

        \ since Ramsay with his contemporaries, and poor Bob Fergusson went to the\
        \ world of deathless exist ence and truly immortal song. The mob of man kind,\
        \ that many-headed beast, would laugh at so serious a speech about an old\

        \ you immediately on receipt of your kind letter, but a mixed impulse of gratitude\
        \ and esteem whispered to me that I ought to send you something by way of\

        \ good offices, the payment that usually recurs to him \u2014 the only coin\
        \ indeed in which he is probably conversant \u2014 is rhyme. Johnson sends\
        \ the books by the fly, as directed, and begs me to inclose liis most grateful\
        \ thanks : my return I intended should have been one or two poetic bagatelles\
        \ which the world have not seen, or, perhaps, for obvious reasons, cannot\
        \ see. These I shall send you before I leave Edinburgh. They may make you\
        \ laugh a little, which, on the whole, is no bad way of spending one's precious\
        \ hours and still more precious breath : at any rate, I wish my Lord Duke\

        \ duke's engagements and occupations deprived him of sufficient leisure to\
        \ peruse the numerous books of miscellaneous information which were continually\
        \ appear ing, it became Mr Hoy's business to devote his forenoons to reading\
        \ them as they arrived ; and then he was enabled, as they sat tete a tete\
        \ over their bottle of claret together after dinner, to fill the duke with\
        \ all that was worth remembering, and his grace's memory was such, that it\
        \ never afterwards lost what it thus received. 'I am, Sir, yours sincerely,\
        \ 'James Ho_.' 1 Mr James Hoy was librarian to His Grace the Duke of \u25A0\
        Gordon, at G ordon Castle. The following sketch of his charac ter is from\
        \ the pen of Mr Robert Carruthers, editor of the Inver ness Courier : \u2014\
        \ 'Mr Hoy's chief sciences were astronomy, entomology, and botany. To the\
        \ first of these he adhered steadily to his dying day, and made almost daily\
        \ observations on the heavenly bodies, arid from his having undertaken the\
        \ regulation of the clocks at Gordon castle and Fochabers, it was matter of\
        \ notoriety that his was the only accurately kept time in the north of Scotland.\
        \ ' We need scarcely say that Mr Hoy was quite indifferent to fame; he equally\
        \ despised riches, never seeking for more than might enable him to dispense\
        \ some charities, and to afford him self respectable clothes, of which he\
        \ never had more than two suits at a time. \"When his kind and indulgent patron\
        \ volun tarily offered him an addition to his sixty-pound salary, he replied,\
        \ \"Keep it to yoursel', my lord duke, I'm no needin1 mair ; ye hae as muckle\
        \ need o't as I hae.\" When Burns was at Gordon castle he was particularly\
        \ delighted with Hoy's blunt manner, and perhaps the circumstance of his being\
        \ a native of the Borders gave him an additional value in the Poet's estima\
        \ tion. Mr Hoy left orders in his will that his remains should be interred\
        \ in the churchyard of the cathedral \"near his auld frien' Mr Duncan,\" the\
        \ SecedeT minister, to whom he had listened so many years of his life, in\
        \ defiance of the wind, rain, snow, or sunshine that may have vainly assailed\
        \ him duriDg his hebdomadal rides to Elgin. 'The old librarian followed his\
        \ noble master to the grave, after the interval of a few short months, and\
        \ we cannot take our leave of him better than in the well-known words of the\
        \ immortal dramatist : \u2014 ' The late Mr James Hoy, librarian to the duke\
        \ of Gordon, was, in many respects, a singular and original character. In\
        \ goodness of heart, and simplicity of manners, he was not unlike Dominie\
        \ Sampson himself ; aud, during the long period of forty e'ix years, during\
        \ which he was the inmate of a ducal mansion, he lost not a shade of his originality,\
        \ or abated one jot of his stoical indifference to riches. The love of learningand\
        \ of virtue which distinguished Mr Hoy, added to his simple and primitive\
        \ habits, rendered him universally respected and noted in the neighbourhood\
        \ of Gordon Castle ; and in the noble family in which he resided, he maintained\
        \ all the same familiar footing that his celebrated prototype, whom we have\
        \ named above, preserved at Ellangowan. Mr Hoy was born at Haining, in Selkirkshire,\
        \ in the year 1747. His father was gardener to Pringle of Haining, or Clifton,\
        \ afterwards Lord Ailmore, one of the lords of session, and his lordship's\
        \ daughter, Miss Violet Pringle, observing young Hoy to be a steady sedate\
        \ lad, had him educated, according to his parents' wishes, for the dissent\
        \ ing church. Lord Ailmore becoming blind, young Hoy was engaged to be his\
        \ reader and companion. Even at this early period, he must have discovered\
        \ considerable signs of scientific genius, for he had an offer to go to Ireland\
        \ with Banks and Solander, as botanist, and to assist in other departments\
        \ of science. ' It was as a sort of literary companion, and as one able to\
        \ scale the different heights and bearings round Gordon Castle, that Mr Hoy\
        \ was recommended to the duke, and scarcely any other situation could have\
        \ been so admirably calculated to pro mote his own happiness ; for, as his\
        \ whole enjoyment was in books, so that which was his delight now became his\
        \ duty. To him the charge of the duke's library was committed. It became the\
        \ castle of which he was appointed governor, and he was never out of his garrison\
        \ except at meal-time3, or when railed into the fields by his scientific pursuits;\
        \ or on Sundays, when he never failed, let the weather be what it might, to\
        \ mount his horse, to ride to Elgin to attend the Seceder meet- * \" O good\
        \ old man ! how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world,\
        \ When service sweat for duty, not for meed !\" 2 Alexander, fourth duke of\
        \ Gordon, wrote a set of words to the old tune of ' Cauld Kail in Aberdeen.\"\
        \ Burns obtained a_copy from Mr Hoy, and inserted it in the first volume of\
        \ the Museum. See the Poet's Remarks on Scottish Song, at tho end of the Correspondence.\

        \ ot the soundproof the noble charity, known as the Penosylvanian Hospital,\
        \ was of a Welsh family. Jlrs. Dewitt Clinton, who died at Poughkeepsie,New\
        \ York, July, 1855, was the widow of the late Gov. Dewitt Clinton, one of\
        \ the greatest, and purest of men in the annals of the State. She was the\
        \ daughter of Dr. Thomas Jones, the son of a Welsh Physician, whose father\
        \ settled at Jamaica, Long Island, and was widely known as Dr. John Jones.\
        \ \xBBHe wai attached to the Revolutionary Army as a Surgeon, and was a personal\
        \ friend of Washington and Franklin. He was one of the founders of the New\
        \ York Hospital, and a professor in the medical faculty, in Columbia College,\
        \ at its first institution. He was the first successful Lithotomist in the\
        \ country. Mrs. Clinton was his grand-daughter, having Dr. Thomas Jones for\
        \ her father, and a daughter of Phillip Livingston, signer of the Declaration\
        \ of Independence, for her mother. Maturin Livingston, a sou of Phillip, married\
        \ a daughter of Genl. Morgan Lewis. Mrs. Clinton was in every sense a remarkable\
        \ woman ; not less for her strength of mind, than for her noble good breeding,\
        \ purity, aDd polish of manners. She was liberal and frank, and fully appreciated\
        \ the great mind of her noble husbiand, and. the harder the storms of personal\
        \ and political strife blew upon him, the closer her affections twined around\
        \ him, while she nobly and devoutly cherished his memory to the last. THE\
        \ CYMRY AMONG THE PILGRIM FATHERS. We may here incidentally state what we\
        \ should have done at an earlier stage of our work : that among the Puritan\
        \ Pil- grims who came over in the Mayflower, were several persons of Welsh\
        \ origin or descent. And among whom was Capt. Jones, the commander of the\
        \ Mayflower; and in the list of passengers were Thomas Rogers, Stephen Hopkins,\
        \ John Alden, and John Howland, the latter of Gov. Carver's family. The Hon.\
        \ Moses H. Grinnell and his brother Henry \u2022Grinnell, two noble and distinguished\
        \ citizens of New York, have lineally descended on their mother's side from\
        \ the above John Howland, who was of Welsh origin. Reynolds, who set out as\
        \ Captain of the Speedwell, which had to put back, was also said to be of\
        \ Welsh origin. We are happy to state in conclusion that Joseph Coggswell,\
        \ Esq., the worthy and learned librarian of the Astor Library, New York, is\
        \ of Welsh descent by the female line, having sprung siom the Phillips and\
        \ Paysons of Ipswich, Massachussetts. CONCLUSION. The Cymbrian etymology of\
        \ Hollandic, Germanic, andBel gic words, could have been greatly extended,\
        \ but our space compelled us to be brief. We know that our definitions may\
        \ not accord with precon ceived opinions, or in all cases prove rigidly accurate.\
        \ The subject was comparatively new to us, and surrounded with many difficulties.\
        \ Being a native of the United States (but of Welsh descent on the side of\
        \ both parents), we could", 1]

        have been quite " all one that she should have loved some bright particular
        star, and thought to wed it," as that she should hope to make any impression
        upon the heart of the Baron von Schwanberg''s librarian. He certainly must
        have been rather a sin gular young man ; for it is a positive fact, that neither

        it was necessary, or, at least, highly desirable, that he should be always
        attended by his suite ; and Rupert, therefore, as well as his mother, in her
        capa city of dame de compagnie, accompanied him on the present occasion. The
        Countess Adolphe watched their entry with a sort of sparkling satisfaction,
        which made her look extremely pretty ; whde her Venus-like sister, draped,
        as to the ivory shoulders, in transparent lace, and eyes melt ing with a sort
        of dreamy softness, that caused the wicked Lucy to rub her little hands with
        uncontrollable glee, seemed to see only one of the group which entered; but
        that one re ceived a smile which the Baroness Gertrude saw, though it is highly

        to converse freely with the mother of its librarian, as there had ever been
        ; but even now this was not to be achieved without difficulty ; for, excepting
        when Gertrude was riding with her father, the mother and daughter were rarely
        separated ; and as she might wish to converse on many points with her humble
        counsellor in a man ner which might startle the still (ostensibly) Roman Catholic
        Gertrude, it was quite ne cessary to her purpose that they should be tete-a-tete.
        It was not long, however, before a severe illness which attacked the Baroness,
        furnished only too good a reason for her entreating Madame Odenthal to make
        the castle her principal abode. A violent cold, caught while taking shelter
        from a sudden storm in a barn, where she was exposed to a strong current of
        air, had attacked her chest ; and she was ordered by her medical attendants
        to confine herself during the winter to the warm dress ing-room, upon which
        her own apartment opened.', 1]

        but by mine." " And what indiscretion do you fear on my part, Lucy? Do you
        fancy, dearest, that I am likely to proclaim aloud to all who may be willing
        to listen, that I suspect the Ba roness Gertrude von Schwanberg of being enamoured
        of her noble father''s librarian ?" " Nonsense, Adolphe ! You know I have
        no such fancy," replied his wife, endeavour ing to look more light-hearted
        than she felt. " All I meant was, that I think the misery of Gertrude would
        become incalculably greater than it is, if we either of us were to utter a
        word which, by being repeated to her father, might awaken his suspicion. Your
        affection for Rupert might (perhaps) lead you to speak of him to the Baron
        as a man who would not disgrace any alliance. And that might prove quite enough
        to awaken a suspicion." " Fear nothing of the kind, Lucy," replied her husband.

        bride. The scene was a very gay one, and as bright and beautiful as pretty
        women, flowering shrubs, and abundance of wax-lights could make it. Adolphe
        had not forgotten the promise he had given his wife respecting the arrange
        ments for the first waltz ; and it was, there fore, as the partner of the
        Baron von Schwan berg''s librarian, that the beautiful Arabella prepared to
        exhibit her unequalled loveli ness, and her peculiarly bewitching style of
        dancing. It was a searching glance that Rupert sent round the circle as he
        stood up with her. This glance was not in the hope of finding anything he
        wished to see, but precisely the contrary ; and though carefully searching,
        it was perfectly satisfactory, for no Baron de Nordorffe was there. Poor Rupert
        was per haps hardly conscious himself of the effect which this discovery produced
        on his spirits, but for the moment it was positively favourable to Arabella,
        for it caused him to dance with', 1]

        more freely than I should trust him with the inferences I may chance to draw
        from them. The prophetic pages, Rupert, might make him wince a little." "
        No !" replied the librarian, the transient gleam fading from his countenance,
        and a look of the deepest dejectiou taking its place. " If he believed in
        your prophecies at all, Adolphe, he would place their fulfilment at too distant
        a date for the chance of it to give him any annoyance." 77 The look and the
        words together made a nearer approach to the forbidden theme than anything
        which had passed between them be fore ; and Adolphe thought that it would
        not be very difficult, by pushing this allusion to the Baron''s feelings a
        little farther, to make poor Rupert lay before him the most sacred secret

        fact, that he was, in more ways than one, a remarkable boy. In most things,
        however, he resembled his mother more than he did his father, espe cially
        as to the character of his intellect. In that peculiar beauty of countenance,
        which had struck Madame de Schwanberg when she first saw him in his sick chamber,
        he deci dedly resembled both his parents ; but the tall stature which he had
        already attained, was evidently inherited from his father. It took the Baroness
        but little time after the young librarian had been fully established in his
        office, to convince her, that if her gra titude for the service he had rendered
        her child, had placed before him all the employ ments and occupations which
        the world could offer, it would have been impossible for him to have fixed

        Rupert Odenthal would marry her !" That was the thought which had entered
        her head ; and certainly it was, considering her own opinion of her beautiful
        sister, a wicked thought. But it would have been more wicked stdl, if the
        Countess Adolphe had not been the daughter of a rich English banker. The idea
        that wealth was the most import ant ingredient in the earthly destiny of a
        human being, had grown with her growth, and strengthened with her strength
        ; and it should be stated in her defence, that if half the wicked thought
        was suggested by the consciousness of the immense relief which it would be
        to get rid of her sister ; the other half arose from the simultaneous recollection
        that Rupert wTas only librarian to the Baron von Schwanberg, although the
        great learning and cleverness of her beloved Adolphe had selected him as his
        chosen friend, on account of his wonderful intellectual superiority. But weighty,

        a right to associate with him on terms of equality. This young Count Adolphe
        it was, whose eyes and heart first did homage to the beauty of Gertrude von
        Schwanberg. The two families had been upon friendly visiting terms before
        Gertrude was born ; but it was not in the nature of the Baron von Schwanberg
        to be intimate with any one, and nothing less active and less daring in its
        na ture than the " sweet passion of love," could even have led to an intercourse
        so nearly ap proaching intimacy, as that which had lately grown up between
        the castles of Schwanberg and Steinfeld. Love is not only active and daring,
        but wonderfully ingenious ; not all the good qua lities of the young Count
        Adolphe, and he had very many such, would even have availed in obtaining for
        him the easy access he now enjoyed to the library at Schwanberg, if he had

        young librarian.', 1]

        mind of Rupert Odenthal was not fitted to be the receptacle of despair. He
        certainly abandoned this hope of remaining the librarian of Schloss Schwanberg
        to his dying day ; but, after meditating through a few sleepless nights, he
        at length came to the conclusion that the approaching event would set his
        spirit more completely at rest, and more perfectly free, than it had ever
        been before ; and the idea of becoming a solitary, undisturbed, literary man,
        and so remaining to his dying day, began to have charms for him. At least
        he fancied so ; but, altogether, it must be confessed that he occasionally
        felt a good deal like a man who had been suffering from delirium ; and it
        was only when this doubtful, dreamy sort of sensation left him, that he became
        conscious of his still pitiable weakness. No sooner did this consciousness

        know my vocation, Count ! Some of them generally stick to me, if they happen
        to be small ;" and, so saying, he thrust his hand into his pocket, and drew
        thence a miniature edition of " La Fontaine''s Fables." " Selected by Fate,
        on purpose to assist my exhibition !" cried Adolphe, seizing it. " Only you
        must be pleased to fancy it a great deal more thick, and a good deal more
        stumpy. So ! Now, theD, remember, if you please, that you are the enamoured

        seat as signed him would permit, and assuming an expression of countenance

        and that they were, moreover, in tended to be lasting. During by far the greater
        portion of Ger trude''s life, the library had been the room in which she had
        chiefly lived ; but now it was so no longer. Not that she had by any means
        given it up as a sitting-room ; on the contrary, she had induced her father
        to repair thither regularly every evening, after he had finished his coffee
        and his pipe, instead of seeking his daughter and his tea (which he had learned
        to love as well as if he had been an Englishman) in the drawing-room. It w-as,
        also, in the library that her favourite pianoforte was now placed, and it

        in progress among them, deemed worthy of being read aloud by Rupert during
        the last hours of the even ing. But before dinner the library now appeared
        to be exclusively the domain of the librarian ; and although his mother occasion

        librarian himself. He was permitted to eat at their table, because, as the
        Baron told him, his being nephew to the holy man who had been ap pointed confessor
        to the castle, made it ex tremely fitting and proper that he should pronounce
        grace at its owner''s table ; and having once been told that he was to dine
        there, and for the especial reason so stated, he thought no more about it,
        but took it for granted, that it was perfectly right and proper that he should
        do so ; and his com mon sense, to which he alone applied for counsel on the
        occasion, made him feel that being thrown into the domestic society of his
        patron''s family, it was desirable that he should, as much as possible, both
        in dress and demeanour, assimilate himself to them. As to the many very busy,
        and also very delightful hours, which he passed in the great room on the other
        side of the castle, he certainly found nothing at all likely to puzzle him
        in any of them. The vocation for which he was expressely hired, seemed to',

        approbation was signified in a manner intended to be very gratifying to them
        all. To his lady he made a speech of consider able length, signifying his
        entire approval of everything she had done, and hinting, in a whisper, not
        intended to reach the ears of Rupert, that however well she might have been
        assisted by the lad whom he had so for tunately fixed upon as his librarian,
        it was quite evident that nothing but the taste and judgment of a person as
        nobly born as her self, could have suggested the different alter ations Which
        had given so noble an air to the apartment. He turned to Gertrude, who was
        on the other side of him as he said this, and added, " I now perfectly understand,

        is magnificent, Gertrude, and your mother, as well as yourself, have shewn,

        mit you to have a holiday from your work in the library for the remainder
        of the day. Your enjoying the joint offices of private secre tary and librarian,
        will, of course, render it occasionally necessary that the great work of forming
        a catalogue should be suspended. Now leave me, Mr. Rupert. My time is very
        valuable. You are too young and inexperi enced, as yet, to be aware of the

        in upon me without having received espe cial permission to do so." Rupert
        bowed low, and was leaving the room in respectful silence, when the Baron
        re called him, to say : " Of course, you are aware, young man, that you are

        " Rupert will never marry for money, Lucy," replied Adolphe, knitting his
        brow. "Don''t look so fierce, my dear," replied his wife, laughing. " I really

        wanderings, was anticipated with pleasure at Schloss Schwanberg, as wrell
        as by the rest of the neighbourhood. It may be that both the Baroness Gertrude
        and her librarian, heard the additional news, of his bringing home a young
        wife with him, with more pleasure than surprise ; but the community of feeling
        between them, on this point, as well as on many others, was never alluded

        well as by every one else in the neighbourhood ; and it was welcomed by all,
        as likely to produce a great many gay parties. The marriage of Adolphe was
        nevertheless not thoroughly approved by his father, for though the lady was
        rich, she was English ; and though she had the reputation of being highly

        of seeing Gertrude riding by his side, so fresh was still the recollection
        of what he had suffered from seeing her life in danger. During this interval,
        the Baroness, and her aidful daughter also, had not only found the examination
        and arrangement of the library to be an occupation full of interest and amusement
        ; but they found also, that, in order to bring it into the condition in which
        if ought to be, it would be absolutely necessary that Rupert should have all
        the assistance they could give him. They had neither of them, as yet, been
        very careful librarians ; but, nevertheless, they knew their way among the

        of this, it seemed as if the young mistress of the Schloss Schwanberg gardens
        did not wish to consult any one''s taste and science in the art of gardening,
        be sides her own and her gardeners ; for although she rarely failed to pass
        some hours every day in the garden, for not even bad weather prevented this,
        she never seemed to remember that there was such a place as the said gar den,
        or such a treasury of beauty and frag rance as her conservatories contained,
        when Rupert was present. What the young librarian might have thought of so
        strange a peculiarity, it would be difficult to say ; but with all his deference
        for the young heiress, he did not permit this apparent caprice on her part,
        to interfere with his love of beautiful flowers, or his scientific cultivation
        of them ; for he made it a daily habit to pass the very first hour of daylight
        in the society of the head gardener, who hap pened to be a familiar frieud

        this particular occasion, he proclaimed his iutention of accompanying her
        party, stating his reason for doing so, to be his wish to see the beautiful
        English heiress, Miss Morrison, performing the national dance. This exceedingly
        flattering compliment was felt as he intended it should be by the beauty,
        who prepared herself accordingly to be more captivating than ever. It is possible,
        indeed, that the extreme care bestowed upon every part of her attire, might
        have had its origin in the silence of Rupert, rather than in the eloquence
        of his patron. In fact, Arabella began to feel a good deal surprized, and
        a little alarmed, at the no pro gress she had made in her resolutely-purposed
        conquest of Rupert : it was really the first time in her life that she had
        ever encountered so much difficulty in achieving this object ; for her beauty

        a more advanced age. The plan which she now thought of for him, was one which
        might immediately be adopted, without any risk that the employ ment it would
        give should be too fatiguing to him, although the injured limb had not yet
        fully recovered its strength. The Baroness, who had gone on increasing the
        already very large library from the first year of her marriage to the present
        day, had long felt the want of a librarian capable of classing and arranging
        it, in such a way, as might save her the trouble and fatigue of en deavouring
        to keep it in order, an under taking which it was, in fact, quite beyond her
        power to accomplish. The strong appetite for reading which the invalid had
        evinced during the tedious lame ness which had resulted from his accident,
        had suggested to her the idea that, young as he was, he might very probably
        find himself sufficiently at home among books, to be use ful to her as a librarian
        ; and the neat hand writing displayed, in consequence of her', 2]

        young librarian, she murmured her gentle enquiries ; first, in French, which
        she spoke with an accent which rendered it pretty nearly intelligible, and
        then in English, which, as she well knew, was his mother-tongue. " Tell me,"
        said she, " for the love of Hea ven, how much of this terrible story is true
        ! I am not made to endure these horrors with indifference ! Life lost ! Human
        life ! And so utterly without preparation ! Oh teU me, Monsieur Rupert ! Tell
        me that it is not true !" To this pathetic appeal, the hard-hearted Rupert
        only replied by the unfeeling words, " I beg your pardon, madame, but I did
        not exactly hear what you said ;" and then, ab ruptly turning to the individual
        he had been listening to, he appeared, and probably really was, utterly forgetful
        of her presence. Gertrude watched all this, and smiled, for she could not

        shut out from all inter course with that stirring world, of whose marvellously
        rapid onward movement she was made tolerably well aware by the unbound compartment
        of her library. Her mother''s often-expressed opinion of Rupert''s intellectual
        superiority, had certainly left a deep impression on her memory ; and this,
        together with her own consciousness that it had never yet been her lot to
        meet any one else whose mind seemed in harmony with her own, or could be in
        harmony w-ith his, made her often sigh in secret that there were no means
        within her reach, by which she could assist him to break through the barrier
        that seemed to separate him from all whose talents and acquirements could
        render them fitting companions for him. The mistake which Rupert had fallen
        into, of fancying that the young Gertrude beheld Count Adolphe with especial
        favour, originated solely in her almost unconscious gratitude to that highly-talented
        young noble for having selected their obscure librarian as his favourite',

        have been the case, had not the sensation of sleepiness been over powered
        by the astonishment he felt at being addressed by some of the most distinguished
        among his guests, with earnest petitions to name an early day for returning
        their visit, and doing them the ''especial favour of induc ing Madame Odenthal
        and her son to accom pany him and his daughter. Had the astonishment of the
        Baron been a little less overpowering, there can be little doubt that his
        reply would have politely, but solemnly, communicated the interesting infor
        mation, that Madame Odenthal being his daughter''s hired companion, would
        certainly (with their permission) accompany her ; but that her son, Mr. Rupert,
        being only his librarian and secretary, he could not think of taking such
        a liberty. But he was far from being sufficiently in possession of his usual
        share of comprehension, to be capable of saying anything of the kind ; all

        therefore, he very courage ously ventured to say, " My dear Arabella, I think
        it is my duty to tell you that you are mistaken." She coloured violently,
        but remained silent for a minute or two, and then said, " On whose authority,
        sir, do you tell me this ?" " It is the opinion of the Baron von Schwanberg,
        Arabella, and, therefore it is mine . . . . for he is a great deal too wise
        a man to be mistaken." This very judicious answer seemed to have great effect,
        for she now remained silent for a much longer interval. In fact, she had been
        waiting with some anxiety for a message from her aged and noble confidant,
        and not receiv ing any, concluded, that, from some accident or other, the
        grand old gentleman had been too constantly engaged to see her in private.
        Upon hearing her brother-in-law thus gravely assert, however, that this said
        grand old gentle man did not believe his librarian was inclined to marry her,

        a dutiful child who is about to be ques tioned. "You think vour sister Arabella

        Lucy, with a modest little curtsey. " How can you talk such nonsense, my dear

        \ they were assisted by their clerks, who gradually assumed the privilege\
        \ of acting as agents for themselves, and virtually did so for a long period.\
        \ It was not till tho year 1754 that they were recognised as such by the Court\
        \ of Session, when an act of sederunt, confirming the privileges so long assumed\
        \ by them with out authority, was passed by that court. They are appointed\
        \ by a letter from an advocate, and if found qualified after certain examinations,\
        \ their names, upon paying certain fees, are enrolled in the list of agents.\

        \ in Scotland. They are mentioned as an existing society in the act constituting\
        \ the Court of Session, in the year 1532. They were originally and literally\
        \ clerks in the secretary of state's office, their business being to record\
        \ and issue writs passing the Signet, on which various proceedings took place.\
        \ As the number of these writs increased, the members of the society became\

        did not seem to partake the indifference of his brethren ; on the contrary,
        he Avas a true type of the bibliopole. For eighteen years that he had resided
        at Pou-tou, he had scarcely quitted his library. He passed in it the Avhole
        day and a part of the night, continually occu pied, he said, in sounding the
        unfathomable depths of the doctrine. Some books, that were lying open on a
        table in the corner, attested, in fact, that he was doing something else than
        merely keeping the place ; and if we had been disposed to listen to him, he
        Avas quite ready and willing to favour us Avith a review of the collection,
        accompanied by a little analysis of the con tents of each volume. He did,
        indeed, begin with wonderful enthusiasm, and it was easy to see that he did
        not often find visitors complaisant enough to listen to his dissertations
        on Avhat for him had become a true worship. But want of time compelled us
        to deprive him and ourselves of the pleasure of this learned oration. We paid
        a visit to the superior of the island, whose habitation was situated near
        the principal temple. The apartments he occupied Avere almost clean, and it
        might even be seen that certain notions of luxury had formerly presided over
        their arrangement. This su perior Avas a man of about forty years of age,
        whose language did not indicate any great skill in literature or theology,
        but whose cunning eye, and brief emphatic speech, denoted a man accustomed
        to business and com mand. He told us that for some years past he had been
        endeavouring to get the pagodas of the island restored, and that almost all

  - - ["149 FRAGMENTS OF THEBAN HISTORY. That the art of writing was known to the\
        \ Egyptians at a very early period, is evident from the fact that some of\
        \ the older monuments have upon them the sign of the papyrus roll, the stylus,\
        \ and the inkstand. A beautiful specimen of this, and also of the papyrus\
        \ roll, may be seen in Dr. Abbott's valuable museum of Egyptian antiquities,\
        \ now in New York. Bunsen considers phonetic and figurative writing as old\
        \ as Menes. Lepsius states that he found in Thebes the tombs of two librarians,\
        \ \u2014 \" chiefs over the books,\" \u2014 of the fourteenth century before\
        \ Christ; and that he traced the ruins of a library in a temple of the same\
        \ era, upon whose walls Champollion had previously found \" the representations\
        \ of Thoth, the God of Wisdom, and of Saf, the Goddess of History; then, behind\
        \ the former, the God of Hearing, and behind the latter, the God of Seeing,\
        \ which significantly reminded the person who was entering of the locality.\"\
        \ The early literature of Egypt, as of all nations, was of a religious character,\
        \ and was chiefly in the hands of the priests. It is claimed, however, by\
        \ some authorities, that \" at the very commencement of our Egyptian history,\
        \ there was a perfectly formed system of writing, and a universal habit of\
        \ writing, by no means confined to the priesthood;\" that writing had already\
        \ ceased to be purely hieroglyphic and monumental, and that the indigenous\
        \ papyrus of the Nile was used as the medium of history. But be this as it\
        \ may, \u2014 admitting that the Egyptians at that high antiquity cultivated\
        \ \" book-writing for literary purposes,\" and that in the time of the Persian\
        \ invasion, there were extant twenty thousand books of Egyptian literature,\

        of great importance. I venture to hope that many years of labour, a portion
        of them in the archives of those countries whose history forms the object
        of my study, will not have been entirely in vain ; and that the lovers of
        human progress, the believers in the capacity of nations for self government
        and self-improvement, and the admirers of dis interested human genius and
        virtue, may find encouragement for their views in the detailed history of
        an heroic people in its most eventful period, and in the life and death of
        the great man whose name and fame are identical with those of his country.
        No apology is offered for this somewhat personal statement. When an unknown
        writer asks the attention of the public upon an important theme, he is not
        only authorized, but required, to show that by industry and earnestness he
        has entitled himself to a hearing. The author too keenly feels that he has
        no further claims than these, and he therefore most diffidently asks for his
        work the indulgence of his readers. I would take this opportunity of expressing
        my gratitude to Dr. Klemm, Hofrath and Chief Librarian at Dresden, and to
        Mr. Von Weber, Ministerial-rath and Head of the Royal Archives of Saxony,
        for the courtesy and kindness extended to me so uniformly during the course
        of my researches in that city. I would also speak a word of sincere thanks
        to Mr. Campbell, Assistant Librarian at the Hague, for his numerous acts of
        friendship during the absence of his chief, M. Holtrop. To that most distinguished

        Stott, a Scotch gentleman of Petersburg, made a donation of one thousand dollars.
        Twelve stu dents were this year in attendance on the theological instructions
        of Dr. Hoge. The trustees of the college over which Dr. Hoge was presiding,
        became at last convinced of their error. Mr. Rice took an active part in the
        exertions to increase the funds of college, enlarge the corps of teachers,
        and raise the standard of scholarship. Petitions were sent to the Legislature
        for aid ; but aiding colleges was not then a popular movement with political
        men. The trustees enlarged the course of study, and to keep pace with other
        colleges better endowed, made the best arrangements for their professors,
        with tutors, and were asking the friends of education for endowments to sustain
        their efforts. Mr. Hoge was remarkably happy in his assist ant instructors
        throughout his whole presidency. He asked them at the throne of grace, and
        God sent him more and better ones than the trustees were able to sustain.
        Charles H. Kennon was for a time vice-president, a man of great ability, whose
        early death the church lamented ; John B. Hoge, the splendid orator, taught
        in the college for a length of time ; S. D. Hoge, a superior teacher, was
        for a time vice-president ; James C. Willson assisted for a time, after wards
        chosen to be Professor of Ecclesiastical History in the Theo logical School
        ; Gilbert Morgan was employed for a time, his life has been spent in advancing
        the cause of education on liberal prin ciples ; Jonathan P. Cushing, the successor
        in the presidency, was for some years a co-laborer with Dr. Hoge in the college.
        Mr. Cush ing was from New Hampshire. His state of health induced him to go
        southward. Stopping in Richmond, he became acquainted with Mr. Rice, who,
        prepossessed in his favor, endeavored to detain him in Virginia, and introduced
        him to his friends in Prince Edward. Dr. Hoge was greatly pleased, and endeavored
        to detain him in connexion with the college. For a time he declined any formal
        or responsible connexion with the college, on account of his health, and his
        conscientious views of a teacher''s duties ; yet, being at once delighted
        with Dr. Hoge, and loving his simplicity of character and benevolent spirit
        more and more, he assisted in the instruction of the college. The first office
        he accepted was the unpretending one of librarian, in 1818. His influence
        over the students was great and salutary. Fond of the natural sciences, he
        called the attention of the students particularly to that department of education.
        The trustees procured apparatus, and in a little time a passion was excited
        among the students for experimental philosophy. In 1819, he accepted the chair
        of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, and was styled the first Professor. In
        discipline, Mr. Cushing excelled. Tall, dignified, noble in appearance, master
        of manners and self respect, he swayed the hearts of college boys, they knew
        not how. They would will to do as he willed to have them. He possessed the
        rare art of managing Virginia boys. Treating religion and its minis- ters
        with the greatest respect, strictly moral and upright, he had net', 1]

        \ demonstrations of their dis approbation were connected with displays of\
        \ anti-Russian feeling, scarcely expected in that Austriau-ridden capital.\
        \ The promises of the court, and the signs of peace, did not prevail long\
        \ without misgivings as to the one, and serious interruptions of the other.\
        \ The court was suspected by the liberal ministry ; and no person was allowed\
        \ to hold an interview with his majesty without the presence of a member of\
        \ the cabinet. Piracy became very frequent throughout the month of July ;\
        \ and persons of respectability, in Athens and other places, were found to\
        \ be connected with it \u2014 the intelligence and inde pendence of these\
        \ persons making the suspicion reasonable that their connection with piracy\
        \ could only be for political purposes. One of the secretaries of the new\
        \ ministry was sus pected of being an agent of the court, and was removed\
        \ from office. In the houses of the it lingered through August, by the end\
        \ of which month it had generally died out. The introduction to the insurgent\
        \ provinces of the Bashi-bazouks, to aid the regular troops, much assisted\
        \ its extinction. The literal meaning of the term Bashi-bazouks is \" spoilt\
        \ heads;\" our English phrase \" mad caps\" answers very well to it. Such\
        \ they were in hunting down the unfortunate Greeks, to whom they gave no quarter\
        \ ; and in this work they displayed more valour than in facing regular troops.\
        \ They committed almost every excess while quartered upon the unfortunate\
        \ and disaffected inhabit ants, whose disaffection was increased by their\
        \ presence. Gradually these adventurers were withdrawn, and before the autumn\
        \ closed the rebellion was quelled, and the sympathisers of Greece were all\
        \ reduced to the condition and character of common robbers by land or sea.\
        \ The spirit of revolt, however, was not extin guished \u2014 the people of\
        \ Greece, and of the Greek provinces of Turkey, were ready to risk life and\
        \ fortune against the hated Moslem whenever an opportunity might offer ; and\
        \ had the Russians penetrated to Shumla, the whole of Bulgaria and Roumelia\
        \ would have risen on their side. As it was, the diversion in favour of Russia\
        \ was dangerous, as likely to sow dis sensions between the German and Western\
        \ powers, and as detaining considerable bodies of Turkish troops from the\
        \ lines opposed to the armies of the czar. Whole divisions of tho Egyptian\
        \ contingent were detained in Thessaly and Macedon, and in garrisoning Constanti\
        \ nople, which might have otherwise taken part in the actions upon the Danube.\
        \ The policy and ambition of the Bavarian ruler of Greece remained unchanged.\
        \ As soon as the French seemed to relax their surveillance, he gave up all\
        \ communication with his minister of the home department, and surrounded himself\
        \ with spies and agents, native or Roumelian Greeks, Russians, Austrians,\
        \ and Bavarians. The Greek king cannot learn; the court must be swept by the\
        \ political besom, and a new govern ment given to Greece, if any hope may\
        \ be entertained for its future fortunes ; but we fear that whatever government\
        \ may pre side at Athens, Greek affairs will not flourish for many years to\
        \ come. The bigotry and brigandage of the people are the two great obstacles.\
        \ Like the patron saint and pattern Emperor of all the Russias, the celestial\
        \ Ni cholas and the imperial Nicholas, the Greeks, as a people, seem to think\
        \ piety and spoliation compatible ; and that true patriotism consists in the\
        \ exaggeration of national manners, the extension of the national bounds,\
        \ and the coercive and even cruel propagation of the national creed. Greece\
        \ has lost her beauty of mind, and retained its acumen and asperity \u2014\

        \ the court phy sician, and the royal librarian, the ministry instituted a\
        \ search, and discovered letters and documents, which satisfied them that\
        \ the court had no sincerity in its professed repentance. A pirate ship was\
        \ captured by a British cruiser; and, from papers on board, and the confessions\
        \ of its captain and crew, it was proved that they had murdered the crew of\
        \ an English merchantman; that they were in the pay of certain officers of\
        \ the royal household and palace previous to the inauguration of the new ministry\
        \ ; and that their murder of the English ship's crew was approved by their\
        \ em ployers ! The allies were disposed to deal summarily with the Greek king,\
        \ but Austria raised difficulties, and Prussia protested \u2014 the minister\
        \ of that court threatening to withdraw from Greece along with the Russian\
        \ ambassa dor, on the ground that its lawful sovereign was coerced, and his\
        \ sovereign rights invaded. The Western powers once more deferred to those\
        \ of Germany, and once more, in doing so, were weak in policy, creating for\
        \ themselves new embarrassments and dangers, to ripen in due time. The largest\
        \ body of insurgents on the Turkish territory were at this juncture surrounded\
        \ and dispersed. Hadji Petros placed himself at the head of 6000 men, and\
        \ advanced to attack a body of 4000 Turks posted at Tricala. Abdi Pasha took\
        \ him in flank with a force equal to his own, and Zeimel Pasha fell upon his\
        \ other flank with a force of 2000 men : the Greeks were dispersed with severe\
        \ loss, the conquerors showing little mercy, as undoubtedly they would have\

        \ to regard him with a sort of pity, as too little entirely for the profession\
        \ of arms. A greater number of the English soldiers \u2014 especially among\
        \ the non commissioned officers \u2014 knew French than might have been supposed,\
        \ or has been generally represented, and the admiration which the French entertained\
        \ for these was boundless. In fact, these men were of great use, not only\
        \ to their fellow-soldiers, but to their regiments, in transacting business,\
        \ for which then a know ledge of the French language was so necessary. When\
        \ the first meetings of considerable bodies of the two armies occurred, their\
        \ cheers were vociferous, and their demonstrations of alliance animated by\
        \ the warmest conceivable cordiality. If making Malta the first rendezvous\
        \ for both answered no other end, it answered this \u2014 of giving the soldiers\
        \ of both nations time to know something of one another, and form an acquaintance\
        \ with those peculiarities to which they would afterwards to some extent be\
        \ obliged mutually to adapt themselves. Yet there were circumstances which\
        \ tried this new born friendship. Upon the British regimental colours there\
        \ are many inscriptions to perpe tuate the memory of the battles won over\
        \ their allies when they were enemies, but the British covered these ensigns\
        \ with a good taste which the French appreciated. Prince Napoleon, it was\
        \ alleged, was so in veterately prejudiced against the English that he could\
        \ never be engaged to countenance the policy of a united action; and although\
        \ burning to revive the military prestige of his name and race, would not\
        \ take a command in an army which was appointed to co-operate with an English\
        \ army in the field. It was even alleged, that during the then recent visits\
        \ of the English generals in France, en route to Malta, he left Paris in order\
        \ not to meet them at the reviews given by his cousin the emperor for their\
        \ en tertainment. Happily, however, he belied all these evil allegations,\
        \ for when he arrived at Malta, no French officer was more complaisant to\
        \ the British than was the prince ; thereby re moving a source of uneasiness\
        \ from both ca binets, if there were any truth in these reports concerning\
        \ him; and, at all events, relieving the English people, and the officers\
        \ of the army, from any apprehensions entertained about the interruption of\

        \ jackets of all sorts, looked like a double row of poppies, relieved here\
        \ and there by the green leaves. The entrances of the hotels \u2014 the Imperial,\
        \ Dumford's, and Ba ker's \u2014 were assailed by weary, gasping people, earnestly\
        \ desiring shelter, and generally re pulsed by the answer, 'No room.' Then\
        \ pri vate lodgings were tried; some of them of the most extraordinary kind,\
        \ and in the most ob jectionable neighbourhoods. A swarthy house holder would\
        \ usher one into the newly-swept charcoal closet, with laudatory remarks on\
        \ its security from noise and cold \u2014 he might have called it light and\
        \ air. The auberges of the knights were filled ; the forts of St. Elmo, St.\
        \ Angelo, Fort Manuel, the new Lazaretto, were bursting with troops ; so was\
        \ it also with the new barracks at Valetta ; in fact, it was only wonderful\
        \ that the caverns of the rocks, the sheltering places of the milch goats\
        \ of the island, had not been also thought of, and se cured for the troops.\
        \ Then the gossip ! Every half-hour brought its news; the clubs, of course\
        \ the nucleus. Greek mischief-makers, Russian spies, Turkish alarmists, were\
        \ all busily engaged. The waiting-rooms of Muir and Goodenough, the two librarians\
        \ of the Strada, were filled with inquirers all day long. Wonderful monster\
        \ vessels, that had ploughed the Atlantic, and were never before heard of\
        \ among us, came proudly into the stirring harbour of Valetta, and were away\
        \ again ere morning light. Old, creaky, craz3* steamers, patched for the time,\
        \ were towed slowly out, laden with women, horses, and stores, \u2014 the\
        \ spectators doubting whether any of them would reach their destination, and\
        \ the destination itself involved in much obscurity. Then all Malta would\
        \ be excited by the thunderings of a salute by the fort, which, reverberating\
        \ among the rocks, was re-echoed by the men-of war in harbour. Anon we all\

        \ English or French colours, oh which we at once ran down again to the Custom-house\

        \ into project ing windows, or out into the narrowest of all bal conies, in\

        in the form of a cross. Whether or not the architect knew what he was doing
        when he constructed it, is not known; but it is said that the Dey of Algiers
        had him decapitated as soon as he discovered what was done. If these things,
        however, were all I had to speak about re- specting Algiers, my readers would
        unite with me iu saying that I was not repaid for my labor. But, happily,
        it is not so. I introduced myself to Mr. Lowitz, the English missionary in
        Algiers for the conversion of the Jews, and Mr. Weiss, a mis- sionary supported
        by the United Presbyterian Church of Scot- land; and from them I gleaned a
        considerable amount of in- formation. Mr. W. has two schools under his care.
        I visited both. There are 25 boys, principally French, and 40 in the night
        schools; and there are 30 girls, viz., six Jewish, 16 Spanish, and eight French.
        All, both boys and girls, are the children of Catholic parents, except the
        Jews and four Protest- ants. Mr. W. does not admit o.ny children of Catholics
        iuto the school unless the parents petition for their admission, and request
        that they may be educated in the Protestant faith. Hence the New Testament
        is regularly read by the scholars, and psalms and hymns are sung by them.
        I also attended an English class, which Mr. W. had commenced about three months
        previously, for youth of both sexes. It was amusing to hear the French scholars
        pronounce some of the words, such as "generation," "time," &c, giving them
        the French accent: " jshenerass''-e-ong," "teem," &c; but several of them
        read English in a very fair way. There is also a library connected with the
        Mission. This also I visited. The librarian was a French soldier; but he is
        now, I believe, a soldier of the cross. " When I was in the army," he said,
        "I saw dead and dying, yet I never shed a tear; but now my heart is broken."
        I was in the bazaars one afternoon with Mr. Weiss, when we met with an old
        Jewish rabbi, selling Jewish books. Mr. W. asked him if he had any Bibles;
        when he replied, "No; your Bibles are wrong." Mr. W. sent him for one, published
        by the British and Foreign Bible Society, and asked him to point out the errors.
        This he was notable to do; whereupon five or six other Jews attacked him,
        (the rabbi,) telling him he lied, and that his word was not worth anything;
        but at the same time they were themselves so lamentably ignorant that they
        were hardly able to answer a single question with regard to the Bible. Mr.
        W. tried to draw them into a discussion; but they said, ". We will not talk
        to you, for you turn our heads."', 1]

        \ dispensary for out-door patients ; while those sick at home and unable to\
        \ attend the dispensary were assisted from this place. The vastness of the\
        \ arrangements may be inferred from the fact that the consumption of sugar\
        \ alone was five hundred pounds daily. The mosque, which was also liberally\
        \ endowed, is an edifice which the traveller may remember by its fine antique\
        \ columns, adapted by the architect. It had a complete establishment of inspectors,\

        the Eussian Government forbids them to wear Polish costumes, from which it

        the patriotic feeling from high to low is universal. A wedding took place
        at an hotel where I was staying in Cracow. I was wondering what the company
        would do to amuse themselves. They did nothing ad the evening, and then sang
        the National hymn. This was not the marriage of a proud, "factious" aristocrat
        (familiar type to the imagination of Eussian and German pamphleteers), it
        was the marriage of a waiter''s daughter, and the guests were waiters, innkeepers,
        and small tradesmen, with their families. In Warsaw the feeling against Eussia

        \ late principal Librarian of the British Museum, and the Editor of Brand's\
        \ Popular Customs, with whom I have had the pleasure for some years of corresponding\
        \ on this subject, a paper on our festival of All Halloween, All Saints and\
        \ All Souls. I had never collected together my notes on this subject, though\
        \ I was aware that similar festivals were to be found throughout the world.\
        \ The singular circumstance alluded to in the following paper, as to the festival\
        \ of AU Souls having been simul taneously observed by the ancient Peruvians\
        \ and by the Spaniards, on the 2nd November, at first appeared to me, as it\
        \ had to Rivero, as a remarkable but accidental coincidence. But when I had\
        \ completed a paper on the festival, I discovered, on reading it over, that\
        \ it revealed a most startling historical fact, viz. : 1st., that in Peru,\
        \ Hindostan, an cient Persia, Egypt and Britain, the festival of the dead\
        \ had been almost simultaneously observed, at or near the beginning of November\
        \ ; and, 2ndly, that many tribes of North America, as well as the later Persians,\
        \ the Greeks and the Romans, held the festival in February. This, I was aware,\
        \ was a new and most unaccountable point in the history of our race, that\
        \ opened up a peculiarly interesting field of research. Thus by acci dent,\
        \ or rather by patient plodding, I arrived at a truth, which I have recently\
        \ found the genius of Sir Wm. Jones enabled him to forsee, that \" on an enquiry\
        \ into the times of observance of the festivals of nations being made, there\
        \ would be found a striking resemblance among them \u2014 and an attentive\
        \ comparison of them all might throw great light on the religion, and perhaps\
        \ on the history of the primitive world.\" It was evident that with this enquiry\
        \ just opening upon me, it would have been unwise to read the paper I bad\
        \ prepared, before the Society of Antiquaries of London ; and as I was unable\
        \ to remain until the meeting at which it was to have been read, I obtained\
        \ permission to withdraw it. From 1859 to 1863, I have been endeavoring to\

        \ as well as preserved it so long, in November, or in February, among nations\
        \ so far removed from each other. In endeavor ing to supply the clue from\

        \ He also left behind him several choice collections that he had made from\
        \ the records in the Tower of London, reduced into two large paper books of\
        \ his own hand-writing. One contained collections concerning the king's maintaining\
        \ his naval power, according to the practice of his ancestors ; and the other\
        \ about the privileges and jurisdiction of eccle siastical courts. To the\
        \ latter collection, Dr Thomas James of Oxford, in the compilation of his\
        \ ' Manuduction or Introduction unto Divinity,' printed in 1625, confesses\
        \ himself indebted. &tnvs Wlotton. BORN A. D. 1568. DIED A. D. 1639. This\
        \ celebrated statesman was the fourth son of Thomas Wotton, of Bocton-Malherb\
        \ in Kent, and grandson of Sir Edward Wotton, privy councillor, and treasurer\
        \ of Calais, under Henry VIII. He was born in 1568, and received his early\
        \ education at Winchester, whence he was removed to Oxford, where he entered\
        \ as a gentleman-commoner of New-college in 158-1, but soon after removed\
        \ to Queen's college. While at Oxford, he distinguished himself by close application\
        \ to his studies ; his proficiency in logic and philosophy was highly satisfactory\
        \ to his tutors, but he peculiarly attached himself to the instructions of\
        \ Alberi cus Gentilis, an Italian refugee of the protestant faith, who at\
        \ this time filled the chair of jurisprudence at Oxford. This able man honoured\
        \ young Wotton with his confidence, and assisted him in the attainment of\
        \ Italian. He appears also to have occasionally sought relief from se verer\
        \ studies in the society of the muses, for we find him receiving the thanks\
        \ of the society of Queen's college for the gratification which his tragedy\
        \ of ' Tancredo' had afforded them. In 1589 his father died, and he succeeded\
        \ to a small annuity of one hundred marks. On this slender pittance he determined\
        \ to set out on his travels ; and accordingly he appears to have spent several\
        \ years in 'France, Germany, and Italy. He resided but one year in France\
        \ ; the next three years he spent in Germany, chiefly at Ingolstadt and Vienna,\
        \ where he passed for a German and a catholic. At Vienna he lodged with the\
        \ emperor's librarian, and enjoyed an opportunity of inspecting numerous important\
        \ manuscripts relating to the state of the empire. From Germany he passed\
        \ into Italy, where he remained five years. His long residence in the latter\
        \ country, though ostensibly devoted to the pursuit of literature and the\
        \ fine arts, was doubtless connected with some purposes of a political nature,\
        \ for we find him using many precautions to conceal his nation. In May, 1592,\
        \ he thus writes to Lord Zouch from Florence, giving an account of his journey\
        \ from Ve nice to Rome: \" I had the company of the baron, with whom, notwith\
        \ standing the catholic religion, I entered into very intrinsical familiarity,,\
        \ having persuaded him that I was half his countryman, himself being born,\
        \ though under the duke of Cleve, not far from Colen, which went for my town.\
        \ I found him by conversation to be very indiscreet, soon", 1]
    - ['LITERARY SERIES. [Fifth 466 is to be regarded as doubtful, on account of the
        uncertainty attending the testimony of the narrator. He lived much out of
        town, having retired from practice, and devoted himself to his studies at
        his country seat at Combe in Surrey. Here he is said to have indulged much
        in a whim of studying under ground, in caves dug for the purpose, ex cluding
        the light of day. In 1651, he finished his work on generation, which, however,
        his modesty might have prevented him from publish - ing, but for the solicitations
        of his friend Sir George Ent, who obtained the papers from him, and gave them
        to the world. It would be to no purpose were we to enter here upon a detail
        of the opinions described in this work. The theoretical views are entirely
        superseded by more modern discoveries ; all that is really valuable consists
        in a vast num ber of insulated anatomical facts which his attentive observation
        ena bled him to collect. In December, 1652, the college of physicians testified
        their regard for Harvey by erecting a statue to his honour, with an inscription
        referring to the discovery which has rendered his name immortal. Having formerly
        obtained the consent of the college, he erected an elegant museum and library
        for their use, and on the 2d of February, 1653, after a splendid entertainment
        given to the presi dent and fellows, presented the house and all that it contained
        to them. This building does not now exist ; it is said to have been very near
        the present situation of Stationers''-hall. Soon after this he resigned his
        office of lecturer on anatomy and surgery ; his successor was the cele brated
        Glisson. In 1654, Dr Prujean resigned the presidency of the college of phy
        sicians, and in the absence- of Harvey the college appointed him to the vacant
        office. This being communicated to him, he came to the as sembly, and, returning
        thanks for the honour proposed to be conferred upon him, begged to be excused
        from accepting it, being unable from age and infirmities to perform the duties
        in an adequate manner. At the same time he added, that if he might, without
        arrogance, presume to give advice in such a matter, he would recommend the
        re-election of Dr Prujean, to whose prudence and diligence the college was
        already much indebted. The advice was followed, and Prujean was immedi ately
        re-instated in his honourable office. It is perhaps to this that we must refer
        the circumstance of Harvey being painted in the robes of the president of
        the college. In 1656, he made over for the perpetual use of the college, his
        paternal estate of fifty-six pounds a-year, partly for the support of a librarian,
        and partly for the institution of an ora tion to be delivered at the annual
        feast of the college. This oration has frequently been spoken by the most
        eminent physicians of the day. His life was prolonged scarcely two years beyond
        this time. He suffered frequently from the gout, which, with the infirmities
        of age, gradually undermined his powers. He died on the 3d of June, 1657 ;
        the disease which immediately caused his death is not mentioned by any of
        his biographers. His funeral was followed to a considerable distance from
        town by the fellows of the college. He was buried in the church at Hampstead
        in Essex. Of the private character of Harvey not much is known. He is said
        to have been in his youth of a choleric disposition, but to have after wards
        exhibited a mild temper and engaging manners. In his contro versial writings
        he displayed great candour and lenity, even when pro-', 1]

        le pou voir,'' was the answer of M. Thiers. From the day of this answer, says
        the sordid and sensual Veron, M. Thiers ceased to inspire the '' Constitutionnel,''
        and the paper, under the tutelage of its ancient patrons, and by the aid of
        the vigorous (it is Veron who so calls it) pens of Granier De Cassagnag, Boilay,
        Cucheval Clarigny, and Cauvain, became the journal of a solution. The law
        of the 31st of May, of which M. Thiers was the promoter, was violently attacked
        in the '' Constitutionnel,'' and the rupture was thus complete between the
        Place de St. George and the journal of the Rue de Valois. Independently of
        Cassagnag, Boilay, Clarigny, and Cauvain, a clever man of the name of Mahtourne,
        now Librarian at the Arsenal, lent his aid to the paper. M. De Castedane,
        a cavalry officer, wrote on military subjects; and M. Burat, Professor at
        the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, dealt with economical doctrines in
        a Protectionist sense till the conclusion of the treaty of commerce in 1860.
        It was in the '' Constitutionnel '' that M. D. Sainte Beuve commenced his
        '' Causeries de Lundi,'' which were so generally read and relished not merely
        in France, but by literary men in most European capitals. The dramatic feuilleton
        acquired a great repute under Hippolyte Rolle, who found an able successor
        in Auguste Lireux. The Neapolitan Fiorentino conducted the musical feudleton
        from 1849 to 1853, when he went to the ''Moniteur,'' where he wrote under
        the name of De Rovray. From 1855, without leaving the '' Moniteur,'' he resumed
        his labours, and wrote the dramatic and musical reviews in', 1]

        noticed by a priest, and was sent for a short time to a Greek school. He got
        fond of studying languages, and went to every library where he could gain
        access, living by charity. At this time, when he got a book, he learned it
        by heart. He became for a short time a servitor in a convent in Lombardy,
        and here he first acquired the faculty of conversing in various languages
        through the numerous strangers of all countries who visited the convent. Mentelle
        is a very extraordinary mathematician, besides being able to speak all the
        European languages, together with the Sanscrit, Hebrew, and partially Chinese.
        His favourite languages in conversing with strangers are the English and the
        Persian, and the former is always a passport to his notice. M. Eichoff, the
        German tutor to the children of Louis Philippe before 1830, was afterwards
        librarian to the queen, and travelled on foot with the late Duke of Orleans
        through Switzerland. He went with the duke to see this singular man, in a
        carriage, with two gen tlemen attendants, whom M. Eichoff was obliged to beg
        to keep out of sight, as they were pressing forward to see where the prince
        and himself were going, and Mentelle, he thought, would shut his door and
        refuse to see them if he observed any strangers intruding upon him. M. Eichoff

        held any public stock. At the moment when I entered I found myself facing
        a gentleman who was quietly engaged in painting a picture ; this artist was
        the librarian. Several other pictures, chiefly landscapes, were thrown into
        a heap in a corner of the library which he had converted into a studio. He
        had the kindness to initiate me into the mysteries of his department. These
        old books contain a vast and interesting collection of autographs, for the
        most remarkable men of every age bave liked to hold stock. The great composer,
        George Frederick Handel, for instance, had two accounts in the funds, one
        of which exceeded 15,000/. In the midst of the Bank books, which are modestly
        covered with veUum, stand out splendidly the books of the old East India Company,
        which, with theh gilt morocco binding, to some extent reflect the pride and
        wealth of that sumptuous commercial company. Surrounded by these grave volumes

        \ the death of Stephen. Henry, archdeacon of Huntingdon, divides his his tory\
        \ into books, and treats distinctly of each of the kingdoms of the heptarchy\
        \ until their union under Edgar. He states that, taking Bede as his basis,\
        \ he added much from other sources, and borrowed from the chronicles which\
        \ he found in ancient libraries. The histori cal writings of Ingulphus, abbot\
        \ of Croyland, are now, with apparent reason, regarded as monkish forgeries.\
        \ William of Malmesbury, one of the fathers of English history, flourished\
        \ during the first half of the twelfth century. He was born in Somersetshire,\
        \ and from that circumstance is called also occasionally Somersetanus, but\
        \ the date of his birth is uncertain. Mr Sharpe, the translator of his ' History,'\
        \ thinks it probable that he was born about the year 1095. If this date is\
        \ any thing near the truth, it seems rea sonable to extend the assigned date\
        \ of his death, viz. 1143, a few years at least, otherwise he must have died\
        \ at the early age of 48 ; and in deed when it is considered that he only\
        \ completed the last of his histo rical pieces in 1 142, and that he subsequently\
        \ made several corrections upon it, it may fairly be presumed that he lived\
        \ several years after this latter date. He was descended, he informs us, from\
        \ Saxon and Nor man parents. When a child he discovered a fondness for learning\
        \ in which he was encouraged by his father; and while yet a boy, he was placed\
        \ for his education in the monastery, from which he afterwards re ceived his\
        \ name, and in which he filled the office of librarian. Here, in addition\
        \ to the study of the Latin language, he applied himself to logic, medicine,\
        \ and ethics, but history soon became his favourite and almost engrossing\
        \ study. The manner in which he conceived and executed the idea of those historical\
        \ works by which he is known, cannot be better described than in his own modest\
        \ and simple terms, which we shall quote from Mr Sharpe's translation.1 \"\
        \ When at my own expense,\" says he, \" I had procured some historians of\
        \ foreign nations, I proceeded, during my domestic leisure, to inquire if\
        \ any thing concerning our own country could be found, worthy of handing down\
        \ to posterity. Hence it arose, that, not content with the writings of ancient\
        \ times, I began, myself, to compose ; not indeed to display my learning \u2014\
        \ which is indeed compara tively nothing \u2014 but to bring to light events\
        \ lying concealed in the con fused mass of antiquity. In consequence, rejecting\
        \ vague opinions, I have studiously sought for chronicles far and near, though\
        \ I confess I have scarcely profited any thing by this industry. For perusing\
        \ them all, I still remained poor in information ; though I ceased not my\
        \ re searches as long as I could find any thing to read. However, what I have\
        \ clearly ascertained concerning the four kingdoms I have inserted in my first\
        \ book, in which I hope truth will find no cause to blush, though perhaps\
        \ a degree of doubt may sometimes arise. I shall now trace the monarchy of\
        \ the West-Saxon kingdom, through the line of successive princes, down to\
        \ the coming of the Normans: which if any person will condescend to regard\

        \ born in London, early in the 16th century, and was educated at St Paul's\
        \ school, under that prince of pedagogues, William Lily. He studied first\
        \ at Cambridge, and subse quently at Oxford. On quitting the latter university,\
        \ he went, for fur ther improvement, to Paris, where in the society of such\
        \ men as Bu d\xE6us, Faber, Paulus \xC6milius, and Francis Sylvius, he not\
        \ only per fected himself in the classical languages, but also acquired very\
        \ consid erable proficiency in French, Italian, and Spanish. He had previously,\
        \ while at Oxford, paid considerable attention to the ancient tongues ol his\
        \ own country. On his return home, he entered into orders, and was appointed\
        \ one of the king's chaplains. Henry also appointed him his librarian, and,\
        \ by a commission, dated in 1533, dignified him with the title of king's antiquary,\
        \ with authority to search after \" England's antiquities, and peruse the\
        \ libraries of all cathedrals, abbeys, priories, colleges, &c, and places\
        \ where records, writings, and secrets of antiquity, were deposited,\" for\
        \ the purpose of illustrating the ancient history and the antiquities of the\
        \ realm. This appointment exactly suited Leland's genius ; and a handsome\
        \ salary being annexed to it, our antiquary was left at full liberty to devote\
        \ himself entirely to the duties of his office. He enter ed upon them with\
        \ the greatest eagerness, and immediately undertook a tour throughout the\
        \ kingdom, for the purpose of carrying his plans into full effect. Gifted\
        \ with a sound constitution, with indefatigable perse verance, with the true\
        \ staunch scent of an antiquary, and armed with the potent authority of a\
        \ royal commission, Leland set out on his travels throughout England and Wales,\
        \ with the determination to traverse the length and breadth of the land, until\
        \ he had put himself in possession of every fact which could aid him in his\
        \ task of elucidating the antiquities of Britain. Not contented with ransacking\
        \ the archives and libraries of every church, and monastery, and cathedral,\
        \ in tht kingdom, he wandered from house to house, poking and prying into\
        \ every corner in which his lively fancy suggested some precious relic of\
        \ ancient times might be sheltered. Not a district, however remote, \u2014\
        \ scarcely a single spot, \u2014 escaped his scrutiny. At last, after six\
        \ long years of toil and travel, he returned to the metropolis, laden with\
        \ the ' spolia opima ' of his arduous enterprise. The king was pleased to\
        \ commend his antiquary's industry and zeal, and, as a mark of his approbation,\
        \ bestowed on him the rich living of Hasely, in Oxfordshire, together with\
        \ a prebendary in the cathedral church of Saruin. In 1545, he presented his\
        \ majesty with the first-fruits of his anti quarian toils, as a new year's\

        \ Dresden, has furnished me with much new matter of great importance. I venture\
        \ to hope that many years of labour, a portion of them in the archives of\
        \ those countries whose history forms the object of my study, will not have\
        \ been entirely in vain ; and that the lovers of human progress, the believers\
        \ in the capacity of nations for self-government and self-improve ment, and\
        \ the admirers of disinterested human genius and virtue, may find encouragement\
        \ for their views in the detailed history of an heroic people in its most\
        \ eventful period, and in the life and death of the great man whose name and\
        \ fame are identical with those of his country. No apology is offered for\
        \ this somewhat personal statement. When an unknown writer asks the attention\
        \ of the public upon an important theme, he is not only authorised, but required,\
        \ to shew that by industry and earnestness he has entitled himself to a hearing.\
        \ The author, too, keenly feels that he has no further claims than these,\
        \ and he therefore most diffidently asks for his work the indulgence of his\
        \ readers. I would take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to Dr\
        \ \xABKlemm, Hofrath and Chief Librarian at Dresden, and to Mr Von Weber,\
        \ Ministerial-rath and Head of the Royal Archives of Saxony. for the courtesy\
        \ and kindness extended to me so uniformly during the course of my researches\
        \ in that city. I would also speak a word of sincere thanks to Mr Campbell,\
        \ Assistant-Iabrarian at the Hague, for his numerous acts of friendship during\
        \ the absence of his chief, M. Hol trop. To that most distinguished critic\
        \ and historian, M. Bakhuyzen van den Brinck, Chief Archivist of the Netherlands,\
        \ I am under deep obligations for advice, instruction, and constant kindness,\
        \ during my residence at the Hague ; and I would also signify my sense of\
        \ the courtesy of Mr Charter-Master de Schwane, and of the accuracy with which\
        \ copies of MSS. in the archives were prepared for me by his care. Finally,\
        \ I would allude in the strongest language of gratitude and respect to M.\
        \ Gachard, Archivist-General of Belgium, for his unwearied courtesy and manifold\
        \ acts of kindness to me during my studies in the Royal Archives of Brussels.",

        \ degree, and was shortly after succeeded in the tutorship by a man of great\
        \ taste and learn ing, Mr afterwards Dr Bennet, bishop of Cloyne. He next\
        \ obtained. on the death of Dr Bamardiston, the office of principal librarian\
        \ : these two appointments he was fairly entitled to from his literary character.\
        \ In the same year he served, in his turn, the office of vice-chancellor of\
        \ the university, and was presented by the minister of the day, Lord North,\
        \ with a valuable piece of preferment, a prebend of Canterbury. The offer\
        \ of a bishopric was twice made him by Mr Pitt, but de clined. The truth is,\
        \ the solemnity and formality of the episcopal character would have sat but\
        \ awkwardly on Farmer. He chose to move without restraint, and to enjoy himself\
        \ without responsibility : to use his own language to a friend, \" one that\
        \ enjoyed the theatre and the Queen's Head in the evening, would have made\
        \ but an indifferent bishop.\" A piece of preferment, however, was soon conferred\
        \ on him by Mr Pitt, no less agreeable to his taste, in point of situation,\
        \ than valuable in point of income, \u2014 a residentiaryship of St Paul's.\
        \ This was given him in exchange for the prebend of Canterbury. It was agree\
        \ able to his taste, as requiring three months' residence in the capital,\
        \ and only three, in the year ; enabling him to enjoy in succession his literary\
        \ clubs in London, and his literary retreat at Cambridge. The various editors\
        \ of Shakspeare, not excepting Johnson, are to be ranked among the admirers\
        \ and friends of Farmer. Steevens, Malone, Reed, &c. have all borne testimony\
        \ to the merit of his Essay. In this work Dr Farmer fully demonstrates, that\
        \ our immortal poet was more indebted to nature than to art, and that his\

        This eminent metaphysician was the son of a clergyman in the north of Scotland.
        He received the rudiments of education at the parish school of Kincardine,
        and at the early age of twelve was sent to the Marischal college of Aberdeen.
        At college he particularly distinguished himself in mathematics. Having attended
        the divinity hall he received license to preach ; but being nominated to the
        office of librarian, he did not enter the church immediately. While holding
        this office he occa sionally taught the mathematical classes for his friend
        Mr John Stew art. In 1737 he was presented to the living of New Machar in
        the neigh bourhood of Aberdeen, where he at first experienced the most violent
        opposition from his parishioners, although he ultimately succeeded in completely
        possessing himself of their esteem and affections. " We fought against Mr
        Reid when he came," said some of them to his suc cessor, "and we would have
        fought for him when he went away." He resigned his pastoral charge on being
        appointed, in 1752, pro fessor of philosophy in King''s college, Aberdeen.
        Previous to his ap pointment he had published a very acute paper in the ''
        Philosophical Transactions'' for 1748, entitled, ''An Essay on Quantity, occasioned
        by reading a Treatise in which simple and compound ratios are applied to Virtue

        \ not being very irascible in my temper, I have easily kept myself clear of\
        \ all literary squabbles. These symptoms of a rising reputation gave me encouragement,\
        \ as I was ever more disposed to see the favour able than unfavourable side\

        \ very structure of his understanding. The foundation of this annihilating\
        \ scepticism had been incautiously laid long before Hume's time, by a no less\
        \ distin guished and excellent man than John Locke, who, in his celebrated\
        \ essay, limited all our sources of knowledge to sensation and conscious ness;\
        \ and by representing ideas as actual existences lodged in the mind, resolved\
        \ every thing into mere consciousness, or the mind's per ceptions of itself,\
        \ and of nothing beyond itself Hume was but follow ing out this doctrine to\
        \ its legitimate though startling and absurd con sequences, when he chose\
        \ to deny the existence of an external world, and to reject the universally-received\
        \ ideas of causation and the uni formity of the laws of nature. It is not\
        \ to be wondered at that men less irascible than Warburton should have railed\

        1714. This friendship was first broken by Sir Richard''s accusing Mr Pope
        of profaneness and immorality, on a report from Curl, that he was author of
        a '' Traves tie on the first Psalm.'' Had it not been for this, all the knight''s
        bad poetry would scarcely have procured him a place in the Dunciad. Perhaps
        Sir Richard was blameable in taking the fact for granted on so poor an authority

        country, and this, good heaven ! with impunity. A sad demon stration this,
        of the low ebb to which the British virtue is reduced in these degenerate
        times.3''" Cijomas BORN* A. D. 1680. DIED A. D. 1735. Thomas Hearne, one of
        the most enthusiastic and indefatigable antiquaries that ever lived, was the
        son of George Hearne, parish-clerk of White Waltham, Berkshire. He was born
        at Littlefield-green in 1680, and received the first elements of instruction
        from his father, who kept a small school in the vicarage house of White Waltham.
        The poverty of the father induced him early to seek a menial employment for
        the son ; but his natural abilities recommending him to the notice of his
        master, Mr Cherry of Shottesbrooke, he was placed by that gen tleman at the
        free school of Bray, where, by dint of steady application, he made excellent
        progress in Greek and Latin, and in a short time so commended himself to his
        patron, that he entered him at Oxford under Dr White Kennet of Edmund-hall.
        Here the bent of his mind was early noticed by Dr Mill, who was at this time
        employed upon the appendix to his edition of the Greek Testament, and who
        gladly availed himself of Hearne''s assistance in collating manuscripts. His
        patron, and other friends, also found him a good deal to do in this way. In
        1699 he took his bachelor''s degree, and soon afterwards declined a proposal
        which was made to him by Dr Kennet to go to Maryland as one of Dr Bray''s
        missionaries. He now became a daily visitor at the Bodleian library, where
        he gradually but rapidly amassed such an extensive and varied acquaintance
        with books, that, at the suggestion of Dr Hudson the librarian, he was appointed
        assistant-librarian in that noble repository of learning. Hearne had now nearly
        reached the sum mit of his ambition ; his subsequent appointment as janitor
        of the public library crowned his wishes, and left him nothing more to desire
        of this world''s honours. The keys of the library were to him the sceptres
        of a prouder kingdom than Britain''s monarch ruled. His unwearied in- * Sir

        \ the literary treasures he commanded ; and the fruits of his patient toil\
        \ and massive erudition soon manifested themselves in a series of publications,\
        \ chiefly of an antiquarian or arch\xE6ological character, which he brought\
        \ out in rapid succession betwixt the years 1702 and 1735. In 1712 he became\
        \ second keeper in the Bodleian library, and in 1713 was offered the place\
        \ of librarian to the Royal society, and the keepership of the museum, which\
        \ he declined, alleging that his circum stances did not permit him to leave\
        \ Oxford. In 1714 he was elected architypographus, and esquire-beadle of civil\
        \ law, in tbe university ; but this appointment he soon afterwards resigned,\
        \ on account of his conscientious objections which he had formed to the oaths\
        \ which it re quired him to subscribe. For the same honourable reason he also,\
        \ at the same time, resigned his under librarianship. His behaviour in this\
        \ respect subjected him to the imputation of a secret leaning towards popery,\
        \ but of this there is not the slightest evidence. He was a con scientious\
        \ single-minded man, who loved the truth for its own sake so dearly, that\
        \ he was equally ready to adhere to it in small as well as in great things.\
        \ He died at the comparatively early age of fifty-five, in consequence of\
        \ a severe cold and succeeding fever, brought on through imprudent excess\
        \ of exertion in his favourite pursuits ; so that it was truly said of him,\
        \ he died \"a martyr to antiquities.\" Hearne was a man of very considerable\
        \ attainments, and of unchang ing devotion to studies ef one particular class.\
        \ It would be doing bis memory great injustice to affect to represent him\
        \ as a mere compiler of catalogues, and index- maker, \u2014 though he executed\
        \ some most laborious works of the kind, \u2014 or a mole-eyed antiquarian,\
        \ whose only delight was to burrow in worm-eaten parchments, and drag again\
        \ into light the well-forgotten lumber of past ages. He brought a mind well-stored\
        \ with the literature of antiquity to his task, and a judgment by no means\
        \ despicable or greatly perverted. He directed his attention to many objects\
        \ of real value, and has laid succeeding generations under obliga tion to\
        \ his industry, to an extent of which few perhaps are aware. Still it must\
        \ be confessed that tbe path of literature which he chose for him self, is\
        \ by no means that which a truly great mind, conscious of its powers, and\
        \ desirous of asserting them, would have selected. Yet Hearne was a man of\
        \ talent in the real sense of the word, and it is astonishing with what an\
        \ intensity of feeling he cherished his passion for antiquities. Among bis\
        \ papers in the Bodleian library, the following pious thanks giving occurs\
        \ foi success vouchsafed to the author in his favourite re searches : \" O\
        \ most gracious and merciful Lord God, wonderful in thy providence, I return\
        \ all possible thanks to thee for the care Thou hast always taken of me. I\
        \ continually meet with most signal instances ol this thy providence, and\
        \ one act yesterday, when I unexpectedly met with three old MSS. ; for which,\
        \ in a particular manner, I return my thanks, beseeching Thee to continue\
        \ the same protection to me, a poor helpless sinner, and that for Jesus Christ\
        \ his sake.\" A passion so ardent as this, for every thing bearing the stamp\
        \ of antiquity, would of course blind its possessor to the due proportion,\
        \ and even moral com plexion of some things : hence we find Hearne severely\

        \ so uncommon, which is, his system atically preferring his most insipid characters\
        \ to his finest, though both were equally his own invention, and he must be\
        \ supposed to have un derstood something of their qualities. Thus he preferred\

        \ ing scripture, addressed a letter of remarks to him, in which he indulged\
        \ in very unseemly language towards so popular a character as Waterland. Pearce,\
        \ bishop of Rochester, took up the contest for Waterland, which drew from\
        \ Middleton ' A Defence of the Letter to Dr Waterland.' Pearce replied, and\
        \ treated his antagonist as an infidel or a disguised enemy to revelation\
        \ ; and Middleton was called upon either to vindi cate himself from the imputations\
        \ of the bishop of Rochester or resign his connexions with the university.\
        \ He did so in ' Some Remarks on Dr Pearce's Second Reply,' and effected at\
        \ least so much in the way of explanation and apology that he was allowed\
        \ to retain his appointments. In 1733, however, Dr Williams, the public orator\
        \ of the university, addressed some ' Observations' to Middleton, in which\
        \ he attempted to prove that the librarian was certainly an infidel, and ought\
        \ to be banish ed from the precincts of a Christian university. Middleton,\
        \ in his answer to this attack, says : \" I have nothing to recant on the\
        \ occasion, nothing to confess, but the same four articles that I have already\
        \ con fessed : 1. That the Jews borrowed some of their customs from Egypt.\
        \ 2. That the Egyptians were possessed of arts and learning in Moses's time.\
        \ 3. That the primitive writers, in vindicating Scripture, found it necessary\
        \ sometimes to recur to allegory. 4. That the Scriptures are not of absolute\
        \ and universal inspiration. These are the only crimes that I have been guilty\
        \ of against religion ; and by reducing the con troversy to these four heads,\
        \ and declaring my whole meaning to be comprised in them, I did in reality\
        \ recant every thing else that, through heat and inadvertency, had dropped\
        \ from me, \u2014 every thing that could be construed to a sense hurtful to\
        \ Christianity.\" In 1735 he publish ed a ' Dissertation concerning the Origin\
        \ of Printing in England,' in which he argues that Caxton introduced the art\
        \ of printing into Eng land, and first practised it here, \u2014 an hypothesis\
        \ controverted in Bowyer and Nichols' ' Origin of Printing.' In 1741 appeared\
        \ his great work, ' The History of the Life of Marcus Tullius Cicero,' in\
        \ two volumes quarto. It was published by subscrip tion, and met with great\
        \ support. The duke of Newcastle and Lord Hervey exerted themselves strenuously\
        \ in procuring subscribers ; although the former nobleman opposed Middleton's\
        \ election to the mastership of the charter- house, and procured that office\
        \ for Mr Mann. Wolfius, in his edition of the four controverted orations of\

        \ : first, that the hero is frequently exalted beyond the bounds of truth\
        \ into a character of ideal virtue ; secondly, that the biographer has paid\
        \ undue attention to his political as contrasted with his literary character\
        \ ; and thirdly, that too little critical acumen has been exercised in distinguishing\
        \ the true from the false in the alleged historical facts interwoven in the\

        \ carried at the funeral of a prince or princess, by Clarencieux, not by Norroy.1\
        \ Oldys was indebted to the duke of Norfolk for his place in the Herald's\
        \ college as Norroy, king-at-arms. Having been apprehended for debt, he spent\
        \ many years in Fleet prison, but at last, on the advice of some friends,\
        \ made his situation known to that noble man, who instantly obtained his release,\
        \ and placed him in the college, per saltum, Norroy, king-at-arms, in return\

        \ anticipated, very imper fect; he appears to have had little classical learning,\
        \ and his style is far from being correct or polished ; but his knowledge\
        \ of English books was prodigious, \u2014 the whole range of our earlier English\
        \ literature had been ransacked by him with a patience and minuteness of search\
        \ which nothing could escape. \" At a time,\" says DTsraeli, \" when our literary\
        \ history, excepting in the solitary labours of Anthony Wood, was a for est,\
        \ with neither road nor pathway, Oldys, fortunately placed in the library\
        \ of the earl of Oxford, yielded up his entire days to researches concerning\
        \ the books and the men of the preceding age. His labours were then valueless,\
        \ \u2014 their very nature not yet ascertained ; and when he opened the treasures\
        \ of our ancient lore, in ' The British Librarian,' it was closed for want\
        \ of public encouragement. Our writers then struggling to create an age of\
        \ genius of their own, forgot that they had had any progenitors : or while\
        \ they were acquiring new modes of ex cellence, that they were losing others,\
        \ to which their posterity or the national genius might return. (To know,\
        \ and to admire only the literature and the tastes of our own age, is a species\
        \ of elegant barbar ism). Spenser was considered nearly as obsolete as Chaucer\
        \ ; Milton was veiled by oblivion, and Shakspeare's dramas were so imperfectly\
        \ known, that in looking over the play-bills of 1711, and much later, I find\
        \ that whenever it chanced that they were acted, they were always announced\

        \ library of Cambridge by the addition of Bishop Moore's library, and his\
        \ election to the office of principal librarian, Middleton published a little\
        \ piece, with the title, 'Bibliotbec\xE6 Cantabrigiensis Ordinand\xE6 Methodus.'\
        \ This pamphlet has been praised for its elegant Latinity ; but, in the dedication\
        \ to tin vice-chancellor, its author made use of some incautious words in\
        \ refer ence to the jurisdiction of the court of king's bench, for which he\
        \ was prosecuted and fined. Poor Colbatch had, a little time previously to\
        \ this prosecution, incurred the displeasure of the same tribunal for some\
        \ expressions in his ' Jus Academicum,' which Bentley 's ingenuity contrived\
        \ to represent as amounting to contempt of court. In 1724 Dr Middleton, now\
        \ a widower, accompanied Lord Coleraine to Italy. The author of the life of\
        \ Middleton, in the ' Biographia Britannica,' relates that when Middleton\
        \ arrived at Rome, one of his first objects was to get himself introduced\
        \ to his brother-librarian of the Vatican. He was received with great politeness\
        \ by the learned keeper ; but, upon his mentioning Cambridge, and the office\
        \ he held there, he had the mortification to be informed by the Italian that\
        \ he was now aware for the-first time of the existence of a seminary of learn\
        \ ing under that name in England. This touched the honour of our new librarian,\
        \ says the writer referred to, who took some pains to con vince his brother\
        \ not only of the real existence, but of the real dignity of his university\
        \ of Cambridge. At last the keeper of the Vatican acknowledged that, upon\
        \ recollection, he had indeed heard of a cele brated school in England of\
        \ that name, but understood it to be only a kind of nursery where youth were\
        \ educated and prepared for their admission at Oxford. Dr Middleton with difficulty\
        \ concealed his mor tification at what was evidently a studied insult ; but\
        \ he resolved to make the inhabitants of Rome aware of the existence of Cambridge,\
        \ and of the dignity of its librarian, by taking a handsome hotel, and launching\
        \ out into a style of living somewhat disproportioned to bis estate. The story\
        \ is after all not highly probable ; but if true, it tells only either for\
        \ the ignorance or the rudeness of him of the Vatican. Middleton returned\
        \ to Cambridge towards the close of the next year. He had not been long in\
        \ his study, however, before he contrived to get into a dispute with the medical\
        \ faculty, by the publication of a tract, ' De Medicorum apud v eteres Romanos\
        \ degentium Conditione.' Doc tors Mead and Ward hastened to vindicate the\
        \ honour of their pro fession, which they considered as called in question\
        \ by Middleton's tractate ; and the latter put forth a ' Defensio,' in which\
        \ he contrived to make up matters with his antagonists so well, that Mead\
        \ and Middleton became afterwards and remained very good friends. Middleton's\
        \ next publication was entitled ' A Letter from Rome, showing an exact con\
        \ formity between Popery and Paganism ; or tbe Religion of the present Romans\
        \ derived from that of their Heathen ancestors.' This work was favourably\
        \ received by the Protestant public, and passed through several editions in\
        \ a few years. Thus far we may consider Middleton's character as standing\
        \ rather high amongst his professional brethren ; but he was now about to\
        \ pur sue a course which totally destroyed all reasonable prospect of pre\
        \ ferment in the church, and brought his own Christianity into serious questioning.\

        \ of invective, and, in his fury, rushed fairly into Bentley s toils. He was\
        \ prosecuted, found guilty, and obliged to brook the humiliation of paying\
        \ the costs of suit, and making a submissive apology to Bentley. The university,\
        \ however, rewarded his martyrdom in their cause with the honourable post\
        \ of public librarian ; and he pursued his aggressions on Bentley with at\
        \ least equal bitterness if more guardedness. His last pamphlet, in this controversy,\
        \ ends thus: \"Being conscious of no offence that my name has ever given,\
        \ nor of any infamy upon it to make it odious to any man, except to himself,\
        \ I am not at all ashamed of producing it. And since it is, as he says, 'to\
        \ die with me and to be buried shortly in oblivion,' he must excuse me the\
        \ reasonable ambition of making the most of it while I live. And that I may\
        \ have some chance for being known like wise to posterity, I am resolved to\
        \ fasten myself upon him, and stick as close to him as I can, in hopes of\
        \ being dragged at least by his great name out of my present obscurity, and\
        \ of finding some place, though an humble one, in the public annals of his\
        \ story. And being willing, before we part, to give him all the encouragement\
        \ I can towards answering me, I here promise that, let him be as severe and\
        \ scurrilous as he pleases upon my person, morals, or learning, I will not\
        \ make myself so mean as to take the law of him, or prosecute printer, publisher,\
        \ or author. I shall be contented to vindicate my character with the proper\
        \ weapons of a scholar, and do myself justice as well as I can ; being ambitious\
        \ of no greater reputation in the world than that I shall find myself always\
        \ well able to defend.\" Middleton's pieces in this famous warfare were: 1.\
        \ ' A Full and Impartial Account of all the late proceedings in the University\
        \ of Cambridge against Dr Bentley.' 2. ' A Second Part of the Full and Impartial\
        \ Account.' 3. ' Some Re marks upon a Pamphlet entitled The Case of Dr Bentley\
        \ further stated.'1 4. ' A True Account of the present state of Trinity College\
        \ in Cam bridge under the oppressive government of their master, Richard Bentley,\
        \ late D. D.' In his subsequent attack on Bentley 's proposals for an edition\
        \ of the New Testament, Middleton was less successful. His ' Remarks, para\
        \ graph by paragraph, upon the Proposals,' are exceedingly bitter, and often\
        \ highly unjust, though he desires his readers \" to believe that they were\
        \ not drawn from him by personal spleen or envy to the author of them, but\
        \ by a serious conviction that he had neither talents nor materials proper\
        \ for the work he had undertaken.\" This is really too much for a mere Latinist\
        \ to say of one who towered above all his fellows as a Greek critic. But Bentley\
        \ \u2014 though he mistook his opponent this time, and directed his fury against\
        \ Dr Colbatch \u2014 was not a whit behind his real antagonist in abuse, misrepresentation,\
        \ and scurrility. His treatment of Colbatch was so scurrilous that the vice-chancellor\
        \ and heads of the university pronounced his pamphlet a scandalous and malicious\
        \ libel, and resolved to inflict a proper censure upon the author as soon\
        \ as he should be discovered ; for no names had yet appeared in this new controversy.\
        \ Middleton then published, in his own name, an answer to Bentley 's ' Defence'\
        \ of his proposals, entitled ' Some Further Remarks, paragraph by paragraph,\
        \ upon Proposals lately published ' 1 Bv Svkes. Neither the 'Full aud Impartial\

        a murmur, and made a second copy as beautiful as the first. In 1800 he was
        profitably engaged by the bishop of St Asaph, to exa mine the Harleian manuscripts
        at the British museum, for the purpose of collating them with the Ernestine

        a critical nature, until within a short period of his death ; in the year
        previous to which, he was elected principal librarian to the London Institution,
        Moor fields. Mr Porson, who had ran little more than two-thirds of the ordinary
        course of human existence, had been for the last eleven years the vic tim
        of a spasmodic asthma, during the agony of which he never went to bed, and
        was forced to abstain from all sustenance. This, of course, greatly debilitated
        his body, and about a month before his death he was also afflicted with an
        intermittent fever. He had an unfortunate ob jection to medical advice, and
        therefore resorted to his usual remedy of abstinence ; but on Monday the 19th
        of September 1808, he suffered an apoplectic stroke, from which he recovered
        only to endure another the next day. He languished in consequence until the
        Sunday night, and then expired without a struggle. The body was opened in
        the presence of several medical men, who gave a report, ascribing his death
        "to the effused lymph in and upon the brain, which they believe to have been
        the effect of recent inflammation. The heart was sound, and the peri cardium
        contained the usual quantity of lymph. The left lung had ad hesions to the

        that, which had always been his favourite object, to take the lead amid his
        intellectual pursuits, though not to the exclusion of others. From infancy
        his mind had been strongly impressed with devotional sentiments ; and although
        he had widely deviated from the doctrinal opinions which he had first imbibed,
        yet all the pious ardour and religious zeal of the sect among whom he was
        educated remained undiminished. He likewise retained in full force the principles
        of a dissenter from the establishment, and those ideas of congregational discipline
        which had become obsolete among many of the richer and more relaxed of the
        separatists. Numerous publications relative to these points soon marked his
        new residence. His '' Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion'' gave,
        in a popular and concise form, his system of divinity with its evidences.
        His '' View of the Principles and Conduct of the Protestant Dissenters'' exhibited
        his notions of the grounds of dissent and the proper character and policy
        of a religious sect ; and a variety of controversial and polemic writings
        presented to the world his views of the Christian dispensation. As a divine,
        if possible, still more than as a philosopher, truth was his sole aim, which
        he pursued with a more exalted ardour, in proportion to the greater importance
        of the subject. Naturally sanguine, and embracing the conclusions of his reason
        with a plenitude of conviction that ex cluded every particle of doubt, he
        inculcated his tenets with an ear nestness limited by nothing but a sacred
        regard to the rights of private judgment in others as well as himself. The
        favourable reception of the ''History of Electricity'' had induced Dr Priestley
        to adopt the grand design of pursuing the rise and pro gress of the other
        sciences, in a historical form ; and much of his time at Leeds was occupied
        in his second work upon this plan, entitled ''The History and Present State
        of Discoveries relating to Vision, Light, and Colours,'' which appeared in
        2 vols. 4to. 1772. This is allowed to be a performance of great merit; possessing
        a lucid arrangement, and that clear perspicuous view of his subject which
        it was the author''s peculiar talent to afford. It failed, however, of attaining
        the popularity of his '' History of Electricity,'' chiefly because it was
        impossible to give ade quate notions of many parts of the theory of optics
        without a more ac curate acquaintance with mathematics than common readers
        can be sup posed to possess. Perhaps too, the writer himself was scarcely
        compe tent to explain the abstruser parts of this science. It proved to be
        the termination of his plan ; but science was no loser by the circumstance,
        for the activity of his mind was turned from the consideration of the discoveries
        of others, to the attempt of making discoveries of his own, and nothing could
        be more brilliant than his success. We find that at this period he had begun
        those experiments upon air which have given the greatest celebrity to his
        name as a natural philosopher. In 1770, Dr Priestley quitted Leeds for a situation
        as different as could well be imagined. His philosophical writings, and the
        recom mendation of his friend Dr Price, had made him so favourably known to
        the Earl of Shelburne that this nobleman made him such advantage ous proposals
        for residence with him, that regard to his family would not permit them to
        be rejected. It was merely in the capacity of his lordship''s librarian, or
        rather his literary and philosophical companion, in the hours that could be
        devoted to such pursuits, that Dr Priestley', 1]

        \ following year he was elected physician to the Westminster Lying-in hospital\
        \ ; which added greatly to his chances of success, and we find that in consequence\
        \ his practice increased \" in a way and with a rapidity,\" to use his own\
        \ words, \"which surprised\" him. Very shortly after he became lecturer on\
        \ midwifery at St Bartholomew's hospital, along with Dr Thynne, and in the\
        \ following year he entered on the sole enjoyment of the emolu ments of that\

        \ but a very successful lecturer, and in a few years was considered one of\
        \ the best in London ; having acquired a surprising facility in communicating\
        \ his ideas, and along with the power of being able to dispense with the use\
        \ of notes. In January, 1814, Dr Gooch married for the second time. The lady\
        \ is sister to Mr Trevors, and the choice was a remarkably happy one. The\
        \ practice of Gooch continued to increase, but his health was not equal to\
        \ his continual exertions. For a long time he had been subject to occasional\
        \ attacks of asthma, and his stomach was beginning to give him considerable\
        \ uneasiness. In the early part of 1815 he had a dan gerous inflammation in\
        \ his lungs, which was happily soon recovered from. In April of the same year\
        \ his eldest son was born. He removed in 1816 to the west end of the town,\
        \ where his practice was rapidly extending. When on a visit to the marquess\
        \ of Wellesley at Ramsgate, the first symptoms of an alarming affection of\
        \ his stomach appeared. He could retain no food, and suffered for some days\
        \ from almost inces sant vomiting, but returned as soon as possible to London,\
        \ where in the course of a few weeks he was sufficiently recovered to be able\
        \ to resume his professional duties. In 1820 he lost his eldest son, a calamity\
        \ which affected him very deeply. His health was now so delicate that he was\
        \ frequently obliged to resign, for a few weeks at a time, his professional\
        \ duties. In 1822 he travelled on the continent, and visited Paris. The state\
        \ of his mind and body prevented him from receiving much enjoy ment from this,\
        \ or indeed from any source. In a tour through part of England the same year\
        \ he met with Dr Parr, and has described his interviews with him in a humorous\
        \ paper published in ' Blackwood's Magazine,' entitled ' Two days with Dr\
        \ Parr.' For some time afterwards his time was partly divided between his\
        \ practice in London and excur sions into various parts of the country. In\
        \ December, 1825, he inserted a paper on the ' Contagious nature of the Plague,'\
        \ in the ' Quarterly Review.' In the same year his health was extremely bad,\
        \ and be visited the continent, travelling in France and Flanders ; but returned\
        \ without receiving any benefit. He suffered from h\xE6morrhage from the lungs,\
        \ but recovered so far as to be able to spend a part of 1826 and 1827 in town,\
        \ attending to his practice, and pursuing his literary labours. In 1826 he\
        \ was chosen librarian to the king, through the influence of Sir William Knighton.\
        \ In 1829 he completed his excellent work on the diseases of children, and\
        \ lived to see his reward in his established reputation. It is said to be\
        \ an extremely valuable book. After this his powers of body gradually sunk\
        \ ; so that before his death he was reduced to a state of great debility ;\
        \ but the powers of his mind, with the excep tion of a few transient attacks\
        \ of delirium, remained unchanged to the last. He died on the 16th February,\

        was prevailed upon by him to put the books under the door of the play ground.
        His uncle''s library was not very extensive ; fortunately, however, there
        was a copy of Shakspeare in it, which he regularly read through every time
        he paid him the accustomed visit during the holidays." In the winter of 1794
        he attended Professor Dugald Stewart''s course of lectures on the Philosophy
        of the Mind, and gained the notice and friendship of that eminent man by modestly
        offering some objections to one of his metaphysical theories which evinced
        great acuteness and force of mind, especially in one so young. In 1798 our
        young meta physician first appeared as an author in a dissertation on Dr Darwin''s
        '' Zoonomia,'' which was very favourably received by the public, and exhibited
        astonishing prematurity of talents and attainments. In 1796 he commenced the
        study of law, with a view to the bar ; but he soon relinquished the legal
        profession, and devoted himself to the study of medicine, in which he took
        a doctor''s diploma in 1803. A few months after receiving his degree, he gave
        to the world the first edition of his poems in two volumes. His next publication
        was occasioned by the famous controversy relative to the election of Mr Leslie
        to the mathe matical chair in the university of Edinburgh. The tractate which
        on this occasion fell from his pen was afterwards matured and perfected into
        his celebrated essay, entitled, '' An Enquiry into the relation of Cause and
        Effect.'' In 1806 he entered into partnership with the celebrated Dr Gregory,
        a circumstance which sufficiently marks the high sense entertained of his
        professional abilities by that eminent man ; but still, says his bio grapher,
        "philosophy was his passion, from which he felt it as a misfor tune that his
        duty should so much estrange him." In the winter of 1808-9, Professor Stewart,
        feeling himself severely indisposed, engaged Dr Brown to read lectures for
        him in the Moral Philosophy class. In the following winter, Mr Stewart had
        again recourse to his assistance. " At this period,7'' says Dr Welsh, " the
        course of my studies had brought me to Mr Stewart''s class, and I trust I
        may be excused for mentioning, that this was the first time that I had the
        pleasure of seeing Dr Brown. I shall never forget his appearance, or the reception
        he met with. The eloquent panegyric he pronounced upon Mr Stewart, and the
        unaffected modesty with which he announced his intention of coming for ward
        with three lectures in the week, had already secured the attention of his
        hearers, and prepared them for all the ingenuity and eloquence of his introductory
        discourse. The expectations that were excited by his first appearance were
        more than equalled by the marvellous display of profound and original thought,
        of copious reading, of matchless inge nuity, and of great powers of eloquence
        which were displayed in his succeeding lectures. His elocution also attracted
        much notice. It was already observed that nature had led him to delight in
        recitation ; and in the English academies, by frequent recitations of select
        jassages in prose and verse, he was trained up to that command of voice and
        cor rectness of pronunciation which now obtained for him so decided a su periority
        in our Scottish University. The classical finish to which he was able in so
        brief a period to bring his lectures, must no doubt have added greatly to
        the enthusiastic admiration that day after day was ex hibited, and which was
        beyond any thing of the kind that I can recollect', 1]

  - - ["Feb., 187 i.] MONARCHISTS AND REPUBLICANS. 273 publicans had the whole even\
        \ of Paris to them selves. The middle-classes were for the most part monarchical,\
        \ though, until cheered by the triumph of their views in the provinces, they\
        \ had not the courage to say so. By the middle of February they began to declare\
        \ themselves \u2014 some with timidity and caution, others more boldly. The\
        \ Paris correspondent of the Times asked a librarian who had expressed strong\
        \ monarchical opinions, and had openly condemned the Republic, how he \u2022\
        -.ould venture to do so in Paris. His answer was that he had fought side by\
        \ side with the battalions of the National Guard from the Belleville quarter,\
        \ and had seen how ready they were to run away. \" They are arrant cowards,\"\
        \ he said, \" whom we know we can beat if it comes to fighting ; they are\
        \ no longer the men of '92.\" The same corre spondent heard a discussion in\
        \ a political club to much the same effect. At this meeting, \"a speaker,\
        \ dwelling upon the political cowardice which made his countrymen go like\
        \ sheep in a direction they secretly detested, urged upon them the necessity\
        \ of greater courage in expressing their sentiments in their choice of a form\
        \ of Government. ' Are you a Monarchist or a Republican ?' shouted a man in\
        \ the audience. This was rather too sudden an application of his own preaching\
        \ to suit the speaker, who seemed embarrassed for a moment, and then said,\
        \ amid loud laughter, * On this point I must be permitted to follow the example\
        \ of my audience, and remain silent.' It was evident that he was a Monarchist,\
        \ and afraid as yet to say so ; but, finding the meeting by no means hostile\
        \ to reactionary views, he took advantage of their ap parent sympathy, and\
        \ went so far in denouncing the Republic that another man took courage, and\
        \ with some boldness denounced it as unfit for the country in its present\
        \ condition, illustrating his position by the character of the local elections,\
        \ and by the fact that political exile was a far stronger qualification in\
        \ the eyes of the Republican than any talent. He alluded with gratification\
        \ to the election of the Duke d'Aumale and Prince de Joinville, and denied\
        \ that Paris could be considered in any way to represent even the large towns\
        \ of France.\" The existence of this feeling was doubt less much more general\
        \ than might have been sup posed. The Republic is always established in Paris\
        \ by a surprise ; and the return of so many extreme politicians in the recent\
        \ elections was rather to be attributed to the defective organisation of the\
        \ moderate party, and to civic cowardice, than to the existence of an actual\
        \ majority in favour of the Red Republic. much of its wonted aspect. The first\
        \ appearance of sullen gloom and smouldering anger dis appeared with the arrival\
        \ of food from the pro vinces and abroad, and in a little while something\
        \ of the old gaiety, self-esteem, and confidence re turned. People said that\
        \ after all Paris had not been conquered by the Prussians; it had only been\
        \ vanquished by hunger : a statement not without a certain degree of truth,\
        \ though subject to the im portant qualification that it was the Prussians\
        \ who produced the hunger. France was going to pre pare herself for a renewal\
        \ of the fight at no distant day, and in a few years' time her soldiers would\
        \ be in Berlin. For the present, there was life to be enjoyed, and the future\
        \ must take care of itself. It is true that a large proportion of the Parisian\
        \ populace was in mourning, and that hardly a woman was to be seen who did\
        \ not wear black. But the theatres were again open and well-attended ; and\
        \ the old animation returned to the streets; and Paris once more danced and\
        \ gesticulated as of yore, and tried to believe herself the queen and oracle\
        \ of the world. The men were never tired of admiring their own heroism, and\
        \ the women swore they would educate their children in the religion of undying\
        \ hatred of Prussia, to take effect as soon as the Republic had regenerated\
        \ the nation, and trained society to a practical faith in the brother- hood\
        \ of peoples. It was under this condition of things as regards the metropolis\
        \ that M. Thiers entered on the task of government at Bordeaux. On Sunday,\
        \ the 19th of February, the newly-appointed head of the Executive read a speech\
        \ in the Assembly, stating that, although he felt frightened at the painful\
        \ duty imposed on him, he nevertheless accepted it with obedience, devotion,\
        \ and love \u2014 sentiments of which France stood all the more in need as\
        \ she was now more unfortunate than at any other period of her history. The\
        \ country, however, was still great, young, rich, and full of resources, and\
        \ would always remain a lasting monument of human energy. M. Thiers then announced\
        \ that he had formed his Administration, and that, in selecting its members,\
        \ he had been guided solely by the public esteem they enjoyed, and their character\
        \ and capacities. The list was as follows : \u2014 M. Dufaure Minister of\
        \ Justice. M.Jules Favre Foreign Affairs. M. Picard Interior. M. Jules Simon\
        \ Public Instruction. M. Lambrecht Commerce. General Le F16 War. Admiral Pothuan\

        \ to make representations, and in a conversation which passed between the\

        \ in America, and perhaps also in England and in Belgium. In all other countries\
        \ she had to look to revolution as the sole means of securing her rightful\
        \ position. This then was the view of the priestly diplo matist stationed\
        \ at Munich in 1869, and formerly representing the Vatican at Paris. Well,\
        \ the revolution so ardently desired by the Vatican did not come to pass,\

        \ France ; that the \u0152cumenical Council was cut short on account of the\
        \ war ; and that very different votes would have been taken by the council\
        \ had the French been victorious. I know from the very best sources that the\
        \ Emperor Napoleon was dragged into the war very much against his will by\
        \ the Jesuitical influences rampant at his court, that he strove very hard\
        \ to resist those influences, that in the eleventh hour he determined to maintain\
        \ peace, that he stuck to this deter mination for half-an-hour, and that he\
        \ was ultimately overpowered by persons representing Rome.\" \u2022 \u2014\

        \ is on my side. (M. Thiers was here interrupted by various exclamations,\
        \ but he appealed to the Assembly to listen to him, and continued) : I give\
        \ these orders with sor row ; but was there ever a time when right was more\
        \ evident than at the present ? Everyone knows the truth of what I say. In\

        \ test the question whether the Queen's subjects are not entitled to have\
        \ gold and silver bullion converted into coin of the realm, on applica tion\
        \ at the Mint. The matter came before the Court on demurrer to the plaintiff's\
        \ declaration, and the substantial question was, whether the old common law\
        \ of the realm had been set aside by a Royal proclamation. On the part of\
        \ the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Solicitor- General conceded the right\
        \ to have gold bullion coined. The Act of 1 870 contained this clause: \u2014\
        \ \" That where any person brings to the Mint any gold bullion such bullion\
        \ shall be coined and delivered out to such person without any charge for\
        \ the coining.\" That was clear and specific, and therefore the right as to\
        \ gold could not be disputed. But as to silver, the Act of Charles II. was\
        \ expressly repealed by the Act of George III., which required a proclamation.\
        \ The contention on the part of Mr. Tomline was that a procla mation issued\
        \ in 181 7 was still in force, and that under it the same right exists with\
        \ respect to silver as with respect to gold. This was now decided against\

        \ of the Boulevards at Paris, Egyptian Pyramids, &c. : the gardens were suppressed\

        \ late Mr. Samp son Ho Igkinscm, who was familiar with the parochial history\
        \ of Marylebone. From this deed we learn that tie premises of Rysbraeck, the\
        \ statuary, were formerly part of the Great (Marylebone) Garden. (See Smith's\
        \ St. Marylebone, 1833.) The orchestra of tbe Gardens stood upon the site\
        \ of No. 17, Devonshire-place, nearly opposite the old church described at\
        \ page 183. Chatterton wrote a burletta, entitled The Revenge, to be performed\

        \ and clustered chimney-shafts, is very picturesque. The Gate-house, built\
        \ by Archbishop Morton about l490, consists of an embattled centre and two\
        \ immense square towers, of fine red brick with stone dressings, and a spacious\
        \ Tudor arched gateway and postern. The towers are ascended by spiral stone\
        \ staircases, leading to tbe Record-room containing many of the archives of\
        \ tbe see of Canterbury. Adjoining the archway is a small prison-room, with\
        \ high and narrow windows, and thick stone walls to which are fastened three\
        \ strong iron rings ; and in the wall are cuttings, including $obn (Grafton,\

        \ and the ancient brick wall on the Thames side, are chequered with crosses\
        \ in glazed bricks. At this gate the dole immemorially given to the poor by\
        \ the Archbishops of Canterbury is constantly distributed. It consists of\
        \ fifteen quartern loaves, nine stone of beef, and five shillings worth of\
        \ half pence, divided into three equal portions, and distributed every Sunday,\
        \ Tuesday, and Thursday, among thirty poor parishioners of Lambeth ; the beef\
        \ being made into broth and served in pitchers. The Lollards' Tower, on the\
        \ left of the outer court, is embattled, and chiefly of dark-red brick, faced\
        \ witb stone on its outer sides. It was built (143-1-5) by Arch bishop Chicheley,\
        \ whose arms are sculptured on the outer wall on tbe Thames side; beneath\
        \ them is a Gothic niche, wherein formerly stood the image of St. Thomas a\

        \ carved with angels and scrolls, and a head resembling that of Henry VIII.\

        \ of stone, with an oaken inner and outer door, each 3i inches thick, closely\
        \ studded with iron rivets and fastenings. This chamber is nearly 15 feet\
        \ in length, by 11 feet in width, and 8 feet high; and has two narrow windows,\
        \ and a small fireplace and chimney. About breast-high are fixed in the walls\
        \ eight large iron rings ; and upon the oaken wainscoting are incisions of\
        \ initials, names, short sentences, crosses, cubes, &c, cut by the unhappy\

        \ to have possessed. To Lambeth House tbe Popish prelates, Tunstall and Thirlby,\

        Royal Tiber may compare." These gardens had their water-gates j one of which,
        York-house-gate, remains, with a terrace shaded by lime-trees. Leicester House,
        at the north-east corner of Leicester-square, had its spacious gardens, now
        the site of Lisle-street, built in 1791. Holborn (Old-bourne) was famed for
        its gardens : Ely-place had its kitchen and flower gardens, vineyard and orchard,
        and the bishops were celebrated for raising choice fruit. (Hee Ely Place,
        p. 321.) Gerarde was an apothecary, and, before the year 1597, had a large
        physic-garden near his house in Holborn, where he raised 1000 plants and trees
        ; a proof " that our ground could produce other fruits besides hips and haws,
        acorns, and pignuts." Gerarde had another physic-garden, in Old-street : his
        earliest publication was the Catalogue (in Latin) of his own garden in Holborn,
        printed in 1596, 4to; reprinted in 4to, 1599. The first edition was dedicated
        to Lord Burghley, whose garden Gerarde had superintended for twenty years
        : the second edition was dedicated to Sir Walter Raleigh. A copy of the first
        edition (of extreme rarity) is in the British Museum; and it proved of great
        use to Mr. Alton in. preparing his Hortus Kewensis, by enabling him to ascertain
        the time when many old plants were first cultivated. Gerarde dated the first
        edition of his Herbal from Holborn. Wood calls him "the best herbalist of
        his time." Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum, is a letter of
        Gerarde''s own drawing-up, for Lord Burghley to re commend to the University
        of Cambridge the establishment of a physic-garden there, to encourage the
        " facultie of simpling." Several London localities of Gerarde''s sim fling
        may be gathered from his Herbal. Thus, he says : " Of water violets I have
        not found any such plenty in any one place as in the water ditches adjoining
        to Saint George his fielde, near London." He describes Mile End, Whitechapel,
        as " the common near London where penny-royal grows in great abundance." "
        The small wild buglosse grows upon the drie ditch bank about Pickadilla ;"
        and he found " white saxifrage, burr-reedes, &c.," in the ditch, right against
        the place of execution, St. Thomas-a- Waterings, now the Old Kent-road. Baldwin''s
        Gardens, between Leather-lane and Gray''s-inn-lane, were, according to a stone
        upon a corner-house bearing the arms of Queen Elizabeth, named after Richard
        Baldwin, one of the royal gardeners, who began building here in 1589. Montague
        House, Bloomsbury, had its spacious gardens, " after the French manner ;"
        and the gardens of the houses in Great Russell-street were noted for their
        fragrance. Strype (1720) describes the north side as having gardens behind
        the houses, with the prospect of pleasant fields up to Hampstead and Highgate,
        " inasmuch as this place is esteemed the most healthful in London." The garden
        of the Earl of Lincoln was highly kept, long before the mansion became an
        Inn of Court. The Earl''s bailiff''s accounts (24 Edward I.) show it to have
        pro duced apples, pears, large nuts, and cherries sufficient for the Earl''s
        table, and to yield by sale in one year 135?., modern currency. The vegetables
        grown were beans, onions, garlick, leeks ; hemp was grown ; the cuttings of
        the vines much prized ; of pear-trees there were several varieties; the only
        flowers named are roses. (T. Hudson Turner.) The "walk under the elms," celebrated
        by Ben Jonson, was a favourite resort of Isaac Bickerstaff. In 1 and 2 Philip
        and Mary, the walk under the trees in the coney-garth* or cottrel-garden was
        made; and in 15 Car. II. 1663, the said garden was enlarged, and a terrace-walk
        made on the left side ; of which Pepys says : " to Lincoln''s-inn, to see
        the new garden which they are making, which will be very pretty." The garden-wall
        in Chancery-lane is said to have been partly the labour of Ben Jonson. " Gray''s

        has its gardens with an avenue of limes ; the Inner Temple, a more extensive

        and by various ordinances of the Society, temp. Edw. IV., Henry VII., and

        corner of Down-street, Piccadilly, was built in 1849, for the late H. T. Hope,
        Esq., under the joint superintendence of M. Dusillion, a French artist, and
        Professor Donaldson. The fronts are Caen stone, and have panels of decorative
        marbles in the piers between the windows ; the arrangement of which is novel,
        especially in tbe attic-story. The total height from the street-level to the
        balus trade (surmounted with superbly-carved vases) is 62 feet. The entrance-porch
        in Down-street is very rich ; in the principal window-pediments are sculptured
        the armo rial bearings of Mr. Hope, repeated with the initial H in the very
        handsome iron railing, cast by Andre in Paris. The details throughout show
        very careful and elegant draw ing; and the carving, wholly by French artists,
        is beautifully executed. The grand staircase and hall occupy the centre of
        the building ; the upper hall is paved with coloured marbles in patterns.
        The walls are plastei -of- Paris polished, scagliola panels, and marble plinths
        ; the floors, fire-proof, are of cast-iron girders and tile arches. The ceilings

        to the owner. The collection was formed at the celehrated mansion in Duchess-street,
        Portland-place, in the deco ration of which Mr. Hope, the author of Anastasius,
        exemplified the classic principles illustrated in his large work on Household
        Furniture and Internal Decorations, 1805. Thus the suite of apartments included
        the Egyptian or Black Room, with ornaments from scrolls of papyrus and mummy-cases
        ; the furniture and ornaments were pale yellow and bluish-green, relieved

        Vase ; the furniture partly from Pompeian models. The New Gallery, for 100
        pictures of the Flemish school, antique bronzes and vases ; furniture of elegant
        Grecian design. Mr. Hope died at Duchess-street in 1S31 : he will ever be

        the mansion cost Lord Bute 25,O0OL The Marquis, in 1801, acknowledged the
        possession of the secret of the authorship of Junius''s Letters, which he
        promised to publish ; but his lordship died in the following week. The " Letters"
        are believed by some to have been the joint production of Lord Shelburne,
        Colonel Barre1, and Dunning, Lord Ash burton ; and their three portraits,
        painted in one picture by Sir Joshua Reynolds, in 1781-5, have been regarded
        as evidence of the joint authorship. Possibly, therefore, Junius''s Letters
        were written in Lansdowne, then Shelburne, House. It is better established,
        that oxygen was discovered here, Aug. 1, 1771, by Dr. Priestley, then librarian
        to Lord Shelburne. The reception-room contains a fine collection of sculpture,
        including about fifty statues, as many busts, besides bassi relievi : it was
        commenced by Gavin Hamilton, who first excavated the site of Adrian''s Villa.

        Lambeth was long noted as the residence of astrologers. At Tradescant''s bouse,
        in South Lambeth-road, lived Elias Ashmole, who won Aubrey over to astrology
        (sea pp. 309 and 396). Simon Forman''s burial is entered in the Lambeth parish-register
        : he died on the day he had prognosticated. Lilly says, Forman wrote in a
        book left behind him : " This I made the devil write with his own hand in
        Lambeth Fields, 1569, in June or July, as I now remember." Captain Bubb, contemporary
        with Forman, dwelt in Lambeth Marsh, and " resolved horary questions astrologically,"
        a ladder which raised him to the pillory. At the north corner of Calcot-alley
        lived Francis Moore, astrologer, physician, and schoolmaster, and the original
        author of " Moore''s Almanack." Next to Tradescant''s house lived the learned
        Dr. Ducarel, one of the earliest Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries, and
        librarian at Lambeth Palace. Lambeth Marsh, by Hollar''s map, extended from
        near Stangate to Broadwall ; and was bounded by tbe river on the north-west,
        and the ancient way or road called Lam beth Marsh on the south-east. The names
        of Narrow-wall and Broad-wall were derived from the embankments subsequently
        made. In cutting for the railway and lines of sewerage at the great terminus
        near York-road (a space in size equal to Grosvenor-square), there was found
        a large deposit from the inundations of the Thames, con taining gravel-stones
        and dark wet clay, or pressed river-mud, imbedding fragments of twigs, bones,
        pieces of Roman tile, &c. 1 Narrow-wall, Vine-street, and Cornwall-road are
        delineated in views of these suburbs in Queen Elizabeth''s reign : Vine-street
        is from eight to ten feet below the level ofthe adjacent streets. In the Marsh
        stood, until 1823, an old house, called Bonner''s house, which was traditionally
        known as the residence of Bishop Bonner. Near the Marsh resided Thomas Bushel],
        a man of scientific attainments, who was a friend of Lord Chancellor Bacon.
        He obtained from Charles I. a grant to coin silver money for the purposes
        of the king, when the use of his Mint at the Tower was denied to the king.
        When Oliver Cromwell assumed the protectorate, Thomas Bushell hid himself
        in this house, which it seems had a turret upon it. A large garret extended
        the length of the premises ; in this the philosopher lay hid for upwards of
        a year. This apart ment he had hung with black ; at one end was a skeleton
        extended on a mattress : at the other was a low bed, on which he slept ; and
        on the dismal hangings of the wall were depicted several emblems of mortality.
        At tbe Restoration, Charles II. supported Bushell in some of his speculations.
        He died in 1674, eighty years of age, and was buried in the little cloisters
        of Westminster Abbey. At South Lambeth, upon the site of Sir Noel Caron''s
        mansion and deer-park, are Beaufoy''s Vinegar and Wine Works. Here were a
        vessel of sweet wine containing 59,109 gallons, and another of vinegar of
        56,799 gallons ; the lesser of which exceeded the famous Heidelberg tun by
        40 barrels. Mr. Beaufoy, F.R.S., was an eminent mathematician, and a munificent
        patron of education; his bust is placed in the Council Chamber, Guildhall.
        In Lambeth Walk, close upon the South-Western Rail way, are the Lambeth Ragged
        Schools, founded in 1851 by Mr. Beaufoy, at tbe expense of 10,000/., and 4000/.
        endowment, as a memorial of the benevolent Mrs. Beaufoy, the wife of the founder.
        On part of the site of Belvedere House and Gardens were established, in 1785,
        the Lambeth Water-works, first taking their water from the borders of the
        Thames, then from its centre, near Hungerford Bridge, by a cast-iron conduit-pipe
        42 inches in diameter ; whence, in 1852, tbe works were removed to Seething
        Wells, Ditton, 23 miles by the river-course from London Bridge. Thence the
        water is supplied to the Company''s reservoirs at Brixton, 10s miles, by steam
        pumping-engines, at the rate of 10,000,000 gallons daily; from these reservoirs,
        100 feet above tbe Thames, the water flows by its own gravity through the
        mains; but at Norwood it is lifted by steam power 350 feet, or the height
        of St. Paul''s Cathedral, above the supplying river. K K 2', 1]

    - ['720 CURIOSITIES OF LONDON. side ; and at Gresham College. About 1648-9, some
        of the members, including Dr. (afterwards Bishop) Wilkins, removed to Oxford,
        and were joined by Seth Sinilh, Ralph Bathurst, Sir William Petty, and the
        Hon. Robert Boyle, who met at Petty''s lodgings in an apothecary''s house,
        " because of the convenience of inspecting drugs." The members in London continued
        also to meet, until, in 1658, they were ejected from Gresham College, which
        was required for barracks. Evelyn, Cowley, and Sir William Petty proposed
        separate plans for a " philosophical college :" Sprat says that Cowley''s
        proposition accelerated the foundation of the Royal Society, in praise of
        which he sub sequently wrote an ode. At the Restoration, in 1660, the meetings
        were revived ; and April 22, 1662, the Society was incorporated by royal charter,
        by Charles II. This charter is on four sheets of vellum, and has on the first
        sheet ornamental initials and flowers, and a finely executed portrait of Charles
        in Indian ink; appended is the Great Seal in green wax. The Charter empowers
        the President to wear his hat while in the chair, and the fellows addressed
        the President bareheaded till he made a sign for them to put on their hats
        ; customs now obsolete. Next year the King granted a second charter, which
        is of greater importance than the first ; and his Majesty presented tbe Society
        with the silver-gilt mace. The Mace is about 4 feet in length, and weighs
        190 oz. avoirdupois : its stem is chased with the thistle, and has an urn-shaped
        head, surmounted by a crown, ball, and cross. Upon the head are embossed figures
        of a rose, harp, thistle, and fleur-de-lis, and the initials CR. four times
        repeated. Under the crown are chased the royal arms ; and at the other extremity
        of the stem are two shields, one bearing the Society''s arms, the other a
        Latin inscription denoting the mace to have been presented to the Society
        by Charles II. in 1663. It was long believed by numberless visitors to be
        the " bauble" mace turned out of the House of Commons by Cromwell when he
        dissolved the Long Parliament; but Mr. Weld, the assistant-secretary and librarian,
        in a communication to the Society, April 30, 1846, proved this to be a popular
        error, by showing the warrant for making this mace and delivering it to Lord
        Brouncker, the first President of the Society. Again, the " bauble" was altogether
        different in form from the Society''s mace, and was nearly destitute of ornament,
        and without the crown and cross, as described in Whitelock''s Memorials, and
        represented accordingly iu West''s picture of the Dissolu tion of the Long
        Parliament. From this session, 1663, date the Philosophical Transactions,
        wherein the proceed ings and discoveries of the Society are registered. This
        year the Society exercised their privilege of claiming the bodies of criminals
        executed at Tyburn, which were to be dissected in Gresham College. In 1664,
        the king signed himself in the charter-book as the founder; and his brother,
        the Duke of York, signed as a fellow. In 1667 Chelsea College was granted
        to the Society, for their meetings, laboratory, repository, and library; but
        the building was too dilapidated, "the annoyance of Prince Rupert''s glass-house"
        adjoined it, and the property was purchased back for the king''s use for 1300?.
        The Society then resumed their meetings in Gresham College, until they were
        dispersed by the Great Plague and Fire, after which they met in Arundel House
        in the Strand. The Fellows now (1667) numbered 200, and their subscription
        Is. per week; from the payment of which Newton, who joined the Society in
        1674, was excused, on account of his narrow finances. In 1674 the Society
        returned to Gresham College. They were fiercely attacked : a Warwick physician
        accused them of attempting to undermine the Universities, to bring in popery
        aud absurd novelties ; but a severer satire was The Elephant in the Moon,
        by Butler. Among their early practices was the fellows gathering May-dew,
        and ex perimenting with the divining-rod; and the Hon. Robert Boyle believed
        in the efficacy of the touch of Greatrakes the Stroker for the evil. In 1686
        Newton presented his Principia to the Society, whose clerk, Halley, the astronomer,
        printed the work. The MS, entirely in Newton''s hand, is preserved in the
        library. In 1703 Sir Isaac Newton was elected president. In 1710 the society
        purchased the house of Dr. Brown, at the top of Crane-court, Fleet-street,
        " being in the middle of tbe town and out of noise." This house was built
        by Wren, after the Great Fire of 1666, upon tbe site of the mansion of Dr.
        Nicholas Barbon. This new purchase was considered unfortunate for the society.
        The house required several hundred pounds'' repairs ; the rooms were small
        and inconvenient compared with those of Gresham Col lege ; and the removal
        led to the separation of the Society from the College Professors, after being
        associated for nearly fifty years. Tbe bouse in Crane-court fronted a garden,
        where was a fishpond. There is a small hall on the ground floor, and a passage
        from the staircase into the garden, fronting which are the meeting-room, 25i

        \ and projecting oak cases ; the earliest printed works being in the south-west\
        \ bay-window recess. Until Bancroft bequeathed his books in 1610, each archbishop\
        \ brought his own private collection. Bancroft's books remained at Lambeth\
        \ till 164-6, two years after the execution of Laud, when being seized by\
        \ the Parliament, the use os' them was granted to Dr. Wincocke. They were\
        \ subsequently given to Sion College, and many began to get into private hands\
        \ ; when Selden suggested to the University of Cambridge a right to them,\
        \ and they were delivered, pursuant to an ordinance of Parliament, dated Feb.\
        \ 1617, into their possession. After the Restoration, and re peated demands\
        \ by Juxon and Sheldon, the books were collected, including those in private\
        \ hands, and in the possession of John Thurloe and Hugb Peters. Evelyn writes\
        \ to Pepys, in 16S9, that the library was then \"replenished with excellent\
        \ books, but that it ebbs and flows, like the Thames running by it, at every\
        \ prelate's accession or translation.\" The books left by Archbishops Bancroft,\
        \ Abbot, Laud, Sheldon, and Tenison, bear their arms. There is only one volume\
        \ in the collection known to have be longed to Archbishop Parker, which is\
        \ a volume of Calvin's writing : his arms are on the outside, and within is\
        \ written in red lead, \" J. Parker,\" who was the archbishop's son. The first\
        \ complete Catalogue made of the printed books was drawn up by Bishop Gibson\
        \ when librarian. In 1718 it was fairly copied by Dr. Wilkins, in three volumes\
        \ folio; and it has been continued by his successors to the present time.\
        \ The library consists of rare and curious editions ofthe Scriptures, commentaries\
        \ ofthe early fathers, scarce controversial divinity, records of ecclesiastical\
        \ affairs, English history and topography ; many fine copies, splendidly embellished.\

        \ the architect of the new chapel, as stated in the print by Vertue, in 1751\
        \ : it stands upon an open crypt or cloister, in which the students of the\

        \ about 1596, among the spoils acquired by the gallant Earl of Essex at the\
        \ capture of Cadiz. The ascent to the chapel is by a flight of steps, under\
        \ an archway and porch, the latter built by Hardwick in 1843. The windows\
        \ are filled with glass, unusually fine : those on the sides have figures\
        \ of prophets and apostles, by Flemish artists ; the great eastern and western\
        \ windows have armorial embellishments. The carved oaken seats are of the\
        \ time of James I., but the pulpit is later. The Organ, by Flight and Robson\
        \ (1820), is of great power and sweetness of tone ; and the choral service\
        \ is attentively performed. In the porch is a cenotaph, with Latin inscription,\

        \ of marvellous spontaneity and overpowering rapidity. In the morning it was\
        \ a question how much the legitimate pressure of public opinion could obtain\
        \ from the govern ment and Chamber. At noon one might still discern the symptoms\
        \ of resistance. At three o'clock the last vestige of the empire had disap\
        \ peared, and all Paris proclaimed the republic.\" A fine portrait of the\
        \ emperor, in one of the rooms of the Hotel de Ville, was on the point of\
        \ being destroyed, when M. Gambetta caused it to be turned against the wall,\
        \ exclaiming, \"It is useless.\" Unfortunately such was not the case with\
        \ the portrait painted by Horace Vernet, which surmounted one of the chimneys\
        \ in the Salle du Trone. This painting was torn to pieces ; and a panel in\
        \ the hall of the municipal council, representing the emperor handing to Baron\
        \ Haussmann the decree for annexing the suburbs of Paris, was also much injured.\
        \ Such, apart from a few benches and busts broken, was all the damage done\
        \ at the Hotel de Ville. The library of the municipal council, as well as\
        \ the other adjoining compartments, were re spected, owing to the efforts\
        \ of M. Dardenne, the librarian, and a few National Guards. M. Rochefort,\
        \ whose enlargement had been one of the first acts of the new government,\
        \ went to the hotel, and was received by M. Gam betta, who took him by the\
        \ arm, and gave him a place amongst the members already installed. Some animated\
        \ discussions took place at different points of the building, in the Salle\
        \ St. Jean, the court of Louis XIV., and the Salle du Trone, about the choice\
        \ of a flag for the new republic. Many workmen advocated the red, and some\
        \ standards of that colour had been hoisted on the Place de l'Hotel de Ville.\
        \ But MM. Gambetta, Sch\u0153lcher, and some officers of the National Guard,\
        \ reminded them that the tricoloured flag had conducted France to victory,\
        \ and might do so again; it was that of 1792 and 1793 \u2014 the only real\
        \ national one. Some voices then shouted, \" It is a bastard flag ! It has\
        \ the colour of the Bourbons !\" \"No,\" was the reply ; \" white was the\
        \ colour of old France.\" \" It is a tarnished bunting,\" cried others. \"\
        \ Then we will wash it,\" was the rejoinder of Gambetta. Now that the reign\
        \ of the emperor was deemed past, it was found that his civil list was paid\
        \ monthly, and in advance. He received, in cash, \xA31,000,000 a year; and\
        \ in rents, \xA3200,000. Prince Napoleon and his sister received \xA360,000;\
        \ making a total of \xA31,260,000. The Senate, which had just been abolished,\
        \ cost nearly \xA3200,000. The following characteristic article, under the\
        \ heading of \" The Wolves,\" appeared in the columns of Figaro : \u2014 \"\
        \ Fifty years hence, attentive students of the history of the war of 1870,\
        \ will be much sur- of the sovereign people, upstanding against the stranger.\
        \ In capturing the wretched hero of Strasburg and Boulogne and 2nd of Decem\
        \ ber, the Prussians believed the war ended ; they thought the nation would\
        \ imitate the dastardly abjection of him who, in a thoughtless hour, it accepted\
        \ as its chief. Let us prove to the Prus sians that they are deceived ; that\
        \ so far from being ended, the war has only commenced ; let us show them republican\
        \ France is up, armed and ready to sacrifice the last man, rather than bend\
        \ to the yoke of the stranger. To arms, then ! A nation of 36,000,000 cannot\
        \ be conquered. Spain, in 1808, has given us a memorable example of what a\
        \ nation can do even with out soldiers, against the bravest armies of the\
        \ world. Saragossa, without ramparts, without soldiers, almost without guns,\
        \ but defended by men who could die, arrested for months the best army of\
        \ Napoleon I. Let our cities be inspired by this heroic example. Let the country\
        \ dis tricts rise also, and begin, on the rear and flanks of the enemy, a\
        \ war to the death, a pitiless war of partisans. The Prussians cannot prolong\
        \ the war indefinitely ; they cannot sustain the efforts required for a protracted\
        \ invasion. Time is on our side ; let us fight, therefore, to gain time and\
        \ to use up the enemy. What if our young army still lose battles? Our volunteers\
        \ of 1793 learned to conquer in tbe school of adversity. WTe shall do as they\
        \ did, and like them, if we have republican spirit ; we shall have the glory\
        \ of having delivered our country from a twofold shame \u2014 despotism and\
        \ invasion. To arms, then ! To arms ! and Vive la Republique !\" The same\
        \ journal thus spoke of the emperor's surrender : \u2014 \" These wretched\

        \ THERON, was built by Eumedes, and was in lat 16\xB0 24'. PTOLEMY LAGUS,\
        \ or Soter, was the son of Philip of Macedon, by his coucubine Arsenoe. He\
        \ was a favourite of Alexander the Great, on whose death he obtained Egj-pt,\
        \ Lybia, aud part of Arabia, to which, ou the death of Perdiccas, he added\
        \ C\u0153lo- Syria, Ph\u0153nicia, Juda-a and the isle of Cy- prus. He made\
        \ Alexandria his capital aud built there a lighthouse, called the Pharos,\
        \ as a guide to pilots for that harbour. Alex- andria was now made the port\
        \ ou the Medi- terranean side, aud merchaudize from Europe was carried theuce\
        \ up the Nile to the city of Coptus (probably near Keneh) and conveyed across\
        \ the desert from thence to the sea-port of Myos-Hormos (probably near Cosseir)\
        \ on the Red Sea. He dug a canal from a branch of the Nile to Damietta, a\
        \ port ou the Mediter- ranean. The canal was 100 feet broad, 30 feet deep,\
        \ aud ten or twelve leagues in length, extending in fact to the ' bitter wells.'\
        \ He meant to have continued it to the Red Sea, but desisted from fear that\
        \ the Red Sea was three cubits higher thau the laud of Egypt ! That this canal,\
        \ though deeper thau that of M. de Lesseps, did not succeed is evi- dent from\
        \ the fact that iu 277 b. c. Ptolemy Philadelphus again changed the direction\
        \ of Indian traffic. Ptolemy Lagus died b. C. 285. PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS, son\
        \ aud successor of Ptolemy Lagus, was so named ironically because he killed\
        \ his two brothers. He was a great eucourager of commerce. He is said to have\
        \ caused the Hebrew Scrip- tures to be rendered into Greek, in that ver- sion\
        \ called the Septuagint. He was a liberal patron of learned men. He constructed\
        \ con- siderable fleets both on the Red Sea and the Mediterranean sea. On\
        \ account of the dangers attendiug the port of Myos Hormus, Pto- lemy Philadelphus\
        \ sent au army to construct the haven of Berenice, in which the ships engaged\
        \ in Indian commerce took shelter in great security. Trade increased enormously\
        \ by the new route, and Alexandria became rich and famous. Ptolemy Philadelphus\
        \ (287-246 b. c. ), on the recommendation of his chief librarian (Demetrious\
        \ Philaretes), is said to have sent a Jew of the name of Aristeas, to Jerusalem,\
        \ to ask the high priest for a MS. of the Bible, aud for 70 interpre- ters.\

        \ part of the 18th century. But the rise of the family is owing mainly to\
        \ his son, Ali Mahomed Khan, said to have been of hiudoo extraction, but who\
        \ was adopted by Daood Khan. When the Mahrattas had, in 1771, placed Shah\
        \ Alam on the throne of Delhi, they turned their attention to the conquest\
        \ of the Rohilla country. On the cession of Rohilcund to the British Government\
        \ in 1801, the family were con tinued in their possessions. Ahmad Ali Khau\
        \ died in 1839. 'Ihe succession of his only daughter was rejected, and the\

        importance to return a Burning, member to Oliver''s Parliament. Yet the manufacturers
        of Bir- ham. mingham were already a busy and thriving race. They boasted that
        their hardware was highly esteemed, not indeed as now, at Pekin and Lima,
        at Bokhara and Timbuctoo, but in London, and even as far off as Ireland. They
        had acquired a less honourable renown as coiners of bad money. In allusion
        to their spurious groats, some Tory wit had fixed on demagogues, who hypocritically
        affected zeal against Popery, the nickname of Birminghams. Yet in 1685 the
        population, which is now little less than two hundred thousand, did not amount
        to sour thousand. Birmingham buttons were just beginning to be known : of
        Birmingham guns nobody had yet heard ; and the place whence, two generations
        later, the magni ficent editions of Baskerville went forth to astonish all
        the librarians of Europe, did not contain a single regular shop where a Bible
        or an alma nack could be bought. On market days a bookseller named Michael
        John son, the father of the great Samuel Johnson, came over from Lichfield,
        and opened a stall during a few hours. This supply of literature was long
        found equal to the demand.* These four chief seats of our great manufactures
        deserve especial men tion. It would be tedious to enumerate all the populous
        and opulent hives of industry which, a hundred and fifty years ago, were hamlets
        without parish churches, or desolate moors inhabited only by grouse and wild
        deer. Nor has the change been less signal in those outlets by which the products
        of the English looms and forges are poured forth over the whole world. At
        present Liverpool contains more than three hundred thousand in- iverp o habitants.
        The shipping registered at her port amounts to between four and five hundred
        thousand tons. Into her custom house has been repeatedly paid in one year
        a sum more than thrice as great as the whole income of the English crown in
        16S5. The receipts of her post office, even since the great reduction of the
        duty, exceed the sum which the postage of the whole kingdom yielded to the
        Duke of York. Her endless docks, quays, and warehouses are among the wonders
        of the world. Yet even those docks and quays and warehouses seem hardly to
        suffice for the gigantic trade of the Mersey ; and already a rival city is
        growing fast on the opposite shore. In the days of Charles the Second, Liverpool
        was de scribed as a rising town which had recently made great advances, and
        which maintained a profitable intercourse with Ireland and with the sugar
        colonies. The customs had multiplied eightfold within sixteen years, and amounted
        to what was then considered as the immense sum of fifteen thousand pounds
        annually. But the population can hardly have exceeded sour thousand : the
        shipping was about fourteen hundred tons, less than the tonnage of a single
        modern Indiaman of the first class ; and the whole number of seamen belonging

        ; and although, during the wars of Napoleon, many of the treasures were taken
        away, enough yet remain to make the custodia a marvel of wealth. The key of
        the city, delivered to San Fernando when he captured it from the Moors, was
        shown to us ; also a vase of rock crystal, which contains within it one of
        the thorns from the Saviour''s crown. In the Sala Capitular, with its fine
        ceiling and remark able pavement, hangs the wonderful picture by Murillo of
        " The Conception." It is certainly almost divine. It seems to live, to breathe,
        and the eyes of the Virgin beam with a holy light, which steals into the soul,
        and lingers there for long hours afterwards. There were also paintings of
        Pa checo, and several other artists of celebrity. In the library of the cathedral
        we saw many interesting letters of Columbus. The old librarian kindly permitted
        me to read them. They were written in a bold, forcible hand ; the style was
        terse and graphic. In one he described the eclipse of the sun in Jamaica,
        and the means by which he told the difference of time between the two hemispheres.
        There was a bright and cheerful spirit in his language, a firm energy and
        determination in his words, indicating clearly that indomitable will which
        soared above all obstacles. In some of the letters there were traces of sadness
        and sorrow at the unkindness of his countrymen ; but like a golden thread,
        through both triumph and disappointment, ran the deep and abiding trust in
        the goodness of God, and perfect sub mission to his wisdom. A fine portrait
        of Columbus hangs in the library, where also was the famous sword of Fernan
        Gonsalvo, the great captain in the Moorish wars. His hand must have possessed
        a giant''s strength to have wielded it. From the library we went down into

        and of Montano, the first librarian. The ceil ing, which is extremely lofty,
        is painted by Carducho, and is now as fresh and bright as when painted, some
        three hundred years ago. The old monk was learned, kind, and courteous. He
        gave us most interesting and valuable information concerning the former occupants
        of this wonderful place. He showed us the small room in which Philip died,
        in 1598, at the age of 72. His last illness was of frightful duration, and
        he commanded his people to remove him to a spot whence his eyes could look
        constantly upon the great altar of the church. We also saw the seat where
        he was wont to place himself among the monks in the coro, and listen to the
        music swelling out from the giant organ. In his old age he was rigid in the
        observ ance of his religious duties, casting aside all the regal splen dor
        of the monarch. Just in the rear of the coro is the statue of Christ upon
        the cross, carved by Bcnvenuto Cel lini, and given to Philip by the King of
        Sardinia. It is ot exquisite workmanship, but painful to look upon. So pre
        cious was it deemed, that it was brought all the distance from Barcelona on
        the shoulders of men, for fear the shaking of a carriage might injure it.
        Although many<of the paintings have been removed to the Museo of Madrid, multitudes
        still remain, of rare excel lence. There are many of Raphael, of Tintoretto,
        of Mu rillo, of Titian, and Velasquez. The monk often paused before pictures
        by Navarrete el Mudo (Navarrete the Dumb), and commended them to my especial
        attention. They all por trayed the sufferings of our Saviour, and were indescribably
        affecting. This Navarrete was a poor deaf and dumb boy, who was permitted

        look, they would add, " But the Freuch have darkened our lives again." Just
        without the walls, near to* the Porta del Popolo, is the entrance to the Villa
        Borgliese. Ere its grounds were devastated by the Roman Republicans, in 1849,
        it was said to have been a paradise of smiling glades, quiet dells, long avenues,
        broad plains, thick groves, and sparkling fountains A sad air of neglect and
        decay now hangs over it. In the Casino (principal building) ther-.''1 are
        many works of art, modern as well as ancient. Upon the upper portion of the
        wall, opposite the entrance, is a colossal group in bas relief of Marcus Curtius
        leaping into the gulf of the forum. Then another, by Bernini, of Apollo and
        Daphne, which represents the transformation of the flying nymph into the laurel,
        just as the god is about to seize her. The hands and fingers are already leaves
        and stems, and around the legs the bark is formed and the foliage springing
        out. It is a very curious and remarkable work. In another apartment is Canova''s
        statue of La Venus Victorieuse, for which the Princess Pauline (sister of
        Napoleon the Great) sat as a model. It is very beautiful. The figure is Eve-like
        in cos tume, save a slight scarf thrown over the form. From the absence of
        all drapery arose the question by a friend to Pauline, "How could you endure
        such exposure?" The Princess quietly answered, " It was not in the slightest
        de gree unpleasant, the room was so well warmed;" thus accept ing her friend''s
        inquiry as a question of personal comfort, and not of delicacy of feeling.
        The Villa Albani is very lovely, and its collection of sculpture is ranked
        next to that of the Vatican. As the friend and librarian of Cardinal Albani,
        Winckelman lived many years in the Villa, continuing his researches, which
        have given so much delight to thousands.', 1]

        \ The hotel in which I write this, the well-known Maison Rouge, has been struck\

        \ in getting one of the few rooms which the German officers had not taken\
        \ possession of. Wishing to breakfast, I called for the bill of fare. It was\
        \ as long and elaborate as usual. I came to the con clusion that, although\
        \ the city had been severely injured by the bombardment, the inhabitants had\
        \ been able to procure not only the necessaries, but also the luxuries, of\
        \ life. But I was soon unde ceived. The bill of fare was a relic of pre-siege\
        \ days. I could get beef or ham or pate de foie gras. Towards the end of the\
        \ siege, when provisions became very scarce, pate de foie gras was one of\
        \ the most common articles of food. Large stores of it, intended for exportation,\
        \ had accumulated. Coffee and wine could be had in abundance, but milk was\
        \ unprocurable, and butter could not be purchased under five francs the pound.\
        \ I had not been many hours in Strasburg before a change took place in all\
        \ 1 these respects. Carts laden with vegetables entered the city. Butter was\
        \ again placed on the table. It was announced that milk would be obtain able\
        \ on the morrow.\" The writer lost no time in visit ing all the points of\
        \ interest, and of the cathedral 'he reported that the spire had been injured\
        \ in more places than one. The cross on its summit leaned on one side, as\
        \ if it had been struck by a projectile. Some of the ornamental work had been\
        \ carried away, and in one of the side towers a portion of the stone stairs\
        \ had been destroyed. The outer roof of the nave was burned, and the windows\
        \ here and there were broken with balls. \" To this place the German soldiers\
        \ hastened as soon as they got here. They ascended the tower, they explored\
        \ the interior! The officers were as eager as the men not only to see the\
        \ renowned cathe dral, but also to learn the truth as to the damage done to\
        \ it. All with whom I conversed expressed their satisfaction at the comparative\
        \ unimportance of the injury inflicted. They would have lamented the destruction\
        \ of the cathedral quite as sincerely as the Strasburgers themselves. It is\
        \ the belief of she latter that the destruction of the cathedral was one of\
        \ the designs of the besiegers. More than one German artillery officer assured\
        \ me that orders were daily given not only to spare the city, but also carefully\
        \ to avoid firing in such a way as would either damage or endanger the cathedral.\
        \ Other public buildings, however, have not escaped. The Prefecture, the theatre,\
        \ and the church \u2014 whereof the world-renowned Library formed a part \u2014\
        \ are now represented by bare walls.\" The destruction of the Library was\
        \ more par ticularly described by a correspondent of the Times, who said :\
        \ \u2014 \" In the choir of the Temple Neuf, divided from the nave, was lodged\

        \ in which the archives, antiquities, topo graphy, and early printing collections\
        \ were trea sured. All have perished. Since the apocryphal burning of the\

        \ was a collection of Gallo-Roman antiquities, altars, inscriptions, bas-reliefs,\

        \ which was cut a head of Louis XIV, and a notice that it had been taken from\
        \ the cachets of the Bastille, had a portion destroyed. In the interior of\

        ; but, just at that time, the veteran cartographer died. The East Indian Directors
        then appointed Mr. John Walker to compile and engrave the sheets of the great
        atlas of India. Mr. Walker comes of a family of map engravers. His father
        had worked for Dalrymple, and his name appears on the maps in Vincent''s Nearchus,
        on that in Salt''s Abyssinia, on those in the Arctic voyages of Parry and
        Franklin, and on many others of that period. His name was also immortalized
        by Sir Edward Parry on a lofty cape in the far north, which is well known
        to many an Arctic traveller. The son was thoroughly trained, and the amount
        of judgment and ability he brought to the great task he undertook is shown
        by the often disputed but ever approved excellence of his work. The Indian
        Atlas was designed to occupy 177 sheets, 40 inches by 27, and the globular
        projection and scale (4 miles to the inch), originally proposed by Mr. Aaron
        Arrowsmith, were adopted. The scheme embraces the region from Kurrachee to
        Singapore, and includes Ceylon. Since 1825 Mr. Walker has combined the various
        documents sent home by the surveyors in India, prepared the sheets for publication,
        engraved them on copper, and issued them to the Surveyor General in India
        and to the London Agent. Sir Charles Wilkins, the librarian who had charge
        of all geo graphical records, died in Baker Street, at the great age of 85,
        on the 13th of May 1836. Captain Horsburgh, the hydographer to the East India
        Company, died at Herne Hill, at the age of 74, on the 14th of the same month
        of the same year. Mr. Walker was then engaged to take charge of all the records
        that had previously been under the care of Sir Charles Wilkins, in addition
        to his other duties. As Captain Horsburgh''s coadjutor and successor, Mr.
        Walker produced nearly a hundred charts, many of which are of a large size,
        and the majority continue to be the chief authorities followed by navigators
        in the Eastern seas to this day. He also continued to engrave the sheets of
        the Atlas and other maps. Engraving was his special work. The care of records
        and conduct of geographical business required departmental agency for its
        efficient discharge. None was furnished. All geographical work ceased to be
        performed ; the records were lost or left to rot, and even the correspondence
        book was destroyed. But Mr. Walker''s duties as a cartographer were admirably
        performed.', 1]

        for the pur pose. The scheme was, to publish tracts from time to time on the
        geography, commerce, and products of the East. The result was " The Oriental
        Bepository," in two volumes, which contains several papers of considerable
        interest, especially those on the cidtivation of various Indian''products,
        by Dr. Boxburgh. Dalrymple''s strictly official work is represented by 58
        charts, 740 plans, and 57 views of coasts ; in all, 855 plates, besides 50
        nautical memoirs.* In 1795 the office of hydrographer to the Admiralty was
        created, and Dal rymple was the first to hold it, together with the same post
        at the India House. He filled it until 1808, when he was suddenly called upon
        to resign by Lord Mulgrave. He declined to do so, and was summarily dismissed
        on the 28th of May. On the 31st he published " The Case of A. Dalrymple,"
        bitterly complaining of the treatment he had received. It broke the old man''s
        heart, and he died on the 19th of the following June.f On Dalrymple''s death,
        Captain Hurd succeeded him at the Admiralty, but his post at the India House
        remained for some time vacant, until an accumulation of nautical materials
        led to the appointment of Captain Horsburgh, who had made himself known by
        the publication of several valuable charts of the China seas. Sir Charles
        Wilkins, the librarian, had charge of the original maps, memoirs, and other
        records, while Horsburgh performed the duties of hydrographer. James Horsburgh
        was born of humble and respectable parents at the small village of Elie, on
        the south-east coast of Fife. He com menced his career as a cook and cabin
        boy, and eventually rose to be captain of the " Anna," East Indiaman, in which
        he sailed from England in 1802, returning in 1805. In a paper printed in the
        " Fhilosophical Transactions," he detailed his meteorological obser vations,
        and in 1806 he began to collect materials for sailing direc tions. After some
        years of indefatigable research, he completed his East India Directory, which
        has gone through eight editions, and is still the recognized guide for the

        \ exercise of fancy, the poet himself seems to have intimated the cause of\
        \ it in the epithet he has given to the imagination. For if, according to\
        \ the atomic philosophy, the memory of things be preserved in a chain of ideas,\
        \ produced by the animal spirits moving in continued trains, the force and\
        \ rapidity of the imagination, breaking and dissipating the links of this\
        \ chain by forming new associations, must necessarily weaken, and disorder\
        \ the recollective faculties. Ver. 67. Would all but stoop to what they understand.]\
        \ The expression is delicate, and implies what is very true, that most men\
        \ think it a degradation of their genius to employ it in what lies level to\
        \ their comprehension, but had rather exercise their talents in the ambition\
        \ of subduing what is placed above it. Ver. 80. Some, to whom heaven, d-c]\
        \ Here the poet (in a sense he was not, at first, aware of) has given an example\
        \ of the truth of his observation, in the observation itself. The two lines\
        \ stood originally thus : There are whom heav'n has blest with store of wit,\
        \ Yet want as much again to manage it. In the first line, wit is used, in\
        \ the modern sense, for the effort of fancy ; in the second line it is used\
        \ in the ancient sense, for the result of judgment. This trick, played the\
        \ reader, he endeavoured to keep out of sight, by altering the lines as they\
        \ now stand, Some, to whom heav'n in wit has been profuse, Want as much more,\
        \ to turn it to its use. For the words, ' ' to manage it,\" as the lines were\
        \ at first, too plainly discovered the change put upon the reader, in the\
        \ use of the word \"wit.\" This is now a little covered by the latter expression\
        \ of \"turn it to its use.\" But then the alteration, in the preceding line,\
        \ from \"store of wit,\" to \"profuse,\" was an unlucky change. For though\
        \ he who has \"store of wit \" may want more, yet he to whom it was given\
        \ in \"profusion\" could hardly be said to want more. The truth is, the poet\
        \ had said a lively thing, and would, at all hazards, preserve the reputation\
        \ of it, though the very topic he is upon obliged him to detect the imposition,\
        \ in the very next lines, which show he meant two very different things, by\
        \ the very same term, in the two preceding : For wit and judgment often are\
        \ at strife, Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife. Ver. 88. TJtose\

        \ will, had the command of his study. Among the sweepings was the following\
        \ Satire, which was left unfinished by the poet. It fell, after Bolingbroke's\
        \ death, into the hands of a kinsman, or friend of his, and has since, by\
        \ some strange accident, strayed into Ireland. I saw it there about the year\
        \ 1774, in the possession of the Rev. Dr. Wilson, senior Fellow of Trinity\
        \ College, Dublin, together with a pocket book of Parnell's, Dryden's ' Limberham\
        \ ' corrected by himself, Pope's ' Farewell to London,' and several other\
        \ papers found in the same drawer.\" \u2014 Malone.1 \" I SHALL here present\
        \ the Reader with a valuable literary curiosity, a fragment of an unpublished\
        \ satire of Pope, intitled One Thousand Seven Hundred and Forty ; communicated\
        \ to me by the kindness of the learned and worthy Dr. Wilson, formerly fellow\
        \ and librarian of Trinity College, Dublin ; who speaks of the fragment in\
        \ the follow ing terms : ' This poem I transcribed from a rough draft in Pope's\
        \ own hand. He left many blanks for fear of the Argus eye of those who, if\
        \ they cannot find, can fabricate treason, yet, spite of his precaution, it\
        \ fell into the hands of his enemies. To the hiero glyphics, there are direct\
        \ allusions, I think in some of the notes on the Dunciad. It was lent me by\
        \ a grandson of Lord Chetwynd, an intimate friend of the famous Lord Bolingbroke,\
        \ who gratified his curiosity by a boxful of the rubbish and sweepings of\
        \ Pope's study, whose executor he was, in conjunction with Lord Marchmont.'\

        \ possesses great historical interest. It shows indeed so few signs of inspiration,\
        \ that at first sight the reader will be inclined to doubt whether it is really\
        \ Pope's. But the history of the piece seems to place its authenticity beyond\

        \ wreck cut to pieces and swept off, but, on the last visit of the boats,\
        \ they found the ice piled up around her in such quantities as to form a perfect\
        \ bulwark against the floating ice-fields. The barrier was sufficient to secure\
        \ her from farther injury until the breaking up ofthe ice in spring. Amongst\
        \ the material received at Plover Bay were five hundred sawed telegraph poles,\
        \ brought from British Colum bia for distribution over the tundra. These I\
        \ had at first looked upon as almost superfluous, but now they proved in valuable\
        \ for constructing shelter for the Gate's crew. Under Mr. Frost's superintendence,\
        \ in a couple of days a large, comfortable apartment was constructed, thirty-six\
        \ feet in length by eighteen in width, heaped over with dirt, hav ing good\
        \ berths for the men ranged around the sides, and the ship's stoves put up\
        \ for cooking and heating the room. When completed, their quarters were equally\
        \ as comfortable as our own. The station building was twenty-five feet square,\
        \ divided into four apartments, with a \" loft\" above for our light stores.\
        \ Stoves and berths were put up, and the outer walls made of a double thickness\
        \ of boards, six inches apart, the intervening space being stuffed with ground\
        \ moss for warmth. A kind of cache, or store-house, was built outside for\
        \ our heavy stores, such as beef, pork, molasses. This the men persistently\
        \ called \" Farnam's gash\" (cache), Mr. Far nam being the post quartermaster.\
        \ At Plover Bay, among other things, I was fortunate iu se curing about one\
        \ hundred volumes of poetry, travels, ro mance, and miscellaneous works for\
        \ a station library. These were ranged on shelves for general use \u2014 Mr.\

        \ ta bles, berth curtains, swinging lamps, and various other arti cles from\
        \ the same source, decked out our quarters in mag nificent style (for this\
        \ region), and gave the place such a cheerful and comfortable appearance that\

        \ curious relics of Indian anti quity that have yet been discovered and laid\
        \ before the world. The above were, as is of necessity the case in India,\
        \ where literature is not a separate profession, the produce of leisure hours,\
        \ not exacted by the conscienti ous discharge of efficient duties. The Assay\
        \ Office of the Calcutta Mint, united with that of Secretary to the Mint Committee,\
        \ gave H. H. Wilson constant occupation for a consi derable portion of every\
        \ day. His duties iu these offices were as important as they were useful and\
        \ laborious, and performed not ouly with credit, but in a manner to give him\
        \ high distinction. The Government of India had frequent occasion to acknowledge\
        \ its obliga tion to its learned Assay Master and Mint Secretary, for reforms\
        \ introduced into the coinage, and for other departmental services of eminent\
        \ public merit. But neither official duties, nor literary pursuits, nor both\
        \ these combined, were sufficient for the active mind of Professor Wilson\
        \ at this period of his life. As a member of society, he joined with ardour\
        \ in every scheme of public amusement ; and wasbesides, the originatorandproraoterof\
        \ many measures for the permanent improvement of the people among whom his\
        \ lot was cast. The Theatre of Chowringhee owed for many years its success\
        \ to his management and his trionic talents ; while his musical skill and\
        \ proficiency gave him a place in every concert. But his name will live in\
        \ India, and especial ly in Bengal, for the part he took in promot ing useful\
        \ instruction. H. H. Wilson was the first person who introduced the study\
        \ of Eu- ropean science arid English literature into the education of the\
        \ native population, whose knowledge of English had hitherto been con- fined\
        \ to qualification for the situation of an office clerk. For many consecutive\
        \ years Wilson was the Secretary to the Committee of Public Instruction at\
        \ Calcutta, and he devoted himself especially to directing the studies of\
        \ the Hindu College, from the date of its establishment ; and it was here\
        \ first that the native youth of India were trained to pass examinations that\
        \ would not have discredited first-class seminaries of Eng land. In 1833,\
        \ the University of Oxford having, through the magnificent bequest of Colonel\
        \ Boden, established a Professorship of Sanscrit, Mr. Wilson was selected\
        \ for that liberally endowed situation, as a tribute to the reputation won\
        \ by his literary works and the eminent position he occupied among orien tal\
        \ scholars. He returned soon after to Eng land, and was appointed also to\
        \ the office of Librarian to the East India Company in suc cession to Dr.\
        \ Wilkins. Thus placed in Eng- land, ina position of pecuniary independence,\
        \ he entered upon the career of usefulness and literary distinction which\
        \ reflected so much further honour upon himself. Scarcely a journal was published\
        \ by the Royal Asiatic Society, but was not enriched by an essay, or critique,\
        \ or disquisition from his prolific pen ; and his services at the meetings,\
        \ and ready aid in promoting every useful ob ject, and means of extending\
        \ information up on oriental subjects, were very great. The separate works\
        \ published by H. H. Wilson after his return from India are numerous and highly\
        \ valuable- They have all aimed at tbe wider spread of knowledge in the lore\
        \ which he had so thoroughly mastered,\u2014 like his essays and translations\
        \ of the Vedas and Puranas; \u2014 or like his Sanscrit Grammar, aud Glossary\
        \ of Indian Terms, for the useful pur poses of instruction ; \u2014 or like\
        \ his edition and continuation of \" Mill's History of British India ; \"\
        \ \u2014 or, like his Ariana Antiqua, on the antiquities and coins of Afghanistan,\
        \ with the higher aim of producing a lasting record for the information of\
        \ the world at large. It was the distinguishing characteristic of Professor\
        \ H. H. Wilson that he considered nothing un- worthy of his labours that was\
        \ calculated to be useful ; and was never influenced in his undertakings by\
        \ the mere desire of acquiring distinction, or increasing his fame. Many of\
        \ these works exhibit powers of illustration and close reasoning which place\
        \ their author in a high position among the literary men of the age. But it\
        \ is as a man of deep research, as a Sanscrit scholar aud orientalist, as\
        \ the successor of Sir William Jones and H. T. Colebrooke, aud inheritor of\
        \ the pre-eminence they enjoyed in this particular department of literature,\
        \ that his name will liveamoug th e eminent men of learning of his age and\
        \ country. He died A. D. 1860. His activity may be estimated by the following\
        \ summary. He was Secretary of the Bengal Asiatic Society till 1832 ; Professor\
        \ of Sanskrit in Oxford ; Director of Royal Asiatic Society ; Librarian of\

        \ of the present Mechanics' Institute (a previous one having had a brief existence)\
        \ was held in the year 1847, in the Friends' School-room, at that time situated\
        \ in the Back-way, at the upper end of Great Gates. A few friends of progress\
        \ wishing to improve the intedectual condition of the town, met together in\
        \ that place, and drew up a code of rules, and each lent a few volumes of\
        \ books untd the requisite funds were subscribed for the purchase of a few\
        \ cheap and popular works as a nucleus for a permanent library. Shortly after\
        \ that time a room was taken in the Market Place, wThich was used for about\
        \ seven years as a reading room and bbrary, and in which lectures were given\
        \ by several members of the com mittee and other friends. In the year 1855\
        \ the present site \u2014 on which previously stood the School of Industry\
        \ \u2014 was purchased from the Governors of Bishop Barrington's Charity,\
        \ principally through the instrumentabty of the late Wdliam Hepple, Esq.,\
        \ who was for many years President of the Institute, and who took a great\
        \ interest in its welfare. The building, including fittings for the reading\
        \ room and library, cost about \xA3500. The late Joseph Pease, Esq., subscribed\
        \ \xA3100 towards the purchase. This building being thought inconvenient,\
        \ and unequal to the increasing requirements of the Institute, the committee\
        \ determined upon rebuilding it, and accordingly, in 1865, plans for the present\
        \ structure were prepared, and in the month of June of the following year\
        \ it was completed and opened for the use of the members. The Institute during\
        \ its existence has held two Polytechnic Exhibitions \u2014 the first in the\
        \ large room connected with the building, in the year 1860 ; the last in the\
        \ Town Had, in the year 1864, both of which were highly successful in a pecuniary\
        \ point of view, as wed as a great treat to the general public. It has also\
        \ done much for the encouragement of Penny Readings, and has fre quently had\
        \ classes in the winter season for the study of the various elementary branches\
        \ of science, &c. It numbers at the present time about 200 members, and has\
        \ a library of 12,000* volumes in every department of history, science, and\

        We know that they had been keeping a regular register of the annual rising
        of the Nile then for nearly a thousand years, and that their written law ante-dated
        this library by between two and three thousand years. Both of these facts,
        to some degree, indicate collections of books. By a con currence of happy
        chances, which almost make one regret that a grateful offering can no longer
        be made to good fortune, papyrus-rolls have been found dated from this library,
        and in the Hager behind have been discovered the tombs of some of the Royal
        librarians. The Temple-palace of Sethos, the father of Rameses, though built
        with all the solidity of Egyptian archi tecture in its best days, is a very
        much smaller structure than the Rameseum. What remains of it is in very good
        preservation. It stands about a mile to the north-west of the latter building,
        some little way back in the Hager, and on somewhat higher ground, near the
        entrance of the Valley of the Kings. On one of the sphinxes belonging to it
        are inscribed the names of all the towns in the Delta Sethos conquered. This
        is an important record, as it shows either that the Semites had been able
        to some extent to re-establish them selves in the Delta, or that they had
        never been thoroughly subjugated in that part of the country before the time
        of Sethos. The work, however, was now done thoroughly, for from this time
        we do not hear of any troubles that can be assigned to them. The sculptures
        on the walls of this palace are in the freest and boldest style. They relate
        chiefly to religious acts and ceremonies. As Sethos was the designer and builder
        of the chief part of the stupendous hypostyle Hall of Karnak, it was not because
        his architectural ideas were less grand than those of his son that his', 1]

        very much dila pidated by neglect, and in other ways, during the intervenino-
        seven centuries of occasional violence and o constant decay. One, however,
        is hardly disposed to acquiesce in the opinion on this subject of the historian
        of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire : for, among so large a collection
        of books, there must, one o O would suppose, have been some precious works
        of antiquity which we should now value highly, but which were then lost to
        us irreparably. While we regard with reverence this great library, both for
        the antiquity of the date of its establishment, and for the useful and noble
        purposes it was intended to serve, those of perpetuating and extending know
        ledge, we should be guilty of an injustice if we were to forget that it was
        not the first institution of its kind. The idea of establishing a public library,
        which the Ptolemies deserve much credit for carrying out liberally and thoroughly,
        had nothing original in it in one country, at all events, of the world, and
        that one was Egypt. Eleven centuries before his time, as we have already seen,
        ''the Great Rameses in his temple-palace at Thebes had erected a public library.
        The walls of it are still standing. We need not repeat what we have said elsewhere
        about the sculptures on its walls, the inscription over its door, the manuscripts
        dated from it still in existence, and the tombs of its librarians. This was
        done more than three thousand years ago. Perhaps, then, other ideas and practices
        we may be in the habit of regarding as modern, were also familiar to the Egyptians
        of that remote day. Those times, indeed, may, in some not unim portant matters,
        be virtually nearer to us than the times of our Edwards and Henries.', 1]

        to resent the affront. This could be no justification to the Duchess, though
        it might have been a sufficient answer to Pope. CurU opened his third volume
        with a defensive but scoffing dialogue, which is stated to have taken place
        on September 12, 1735, between himself, and a person whom he caUs Squire Brocade,
        and who is declared to be one of the "Sifters" employed by Pope. Squire Brocade
        maintains that to caU the successive volumes "Mr. Pope''s Literary Correspondence,"
        when they were almost entirely composed of the writings of other people, was
        an imposition upon the town, and CurU had no excuse to offer for continuing
        the practice, except that he commenced the series with Pope materials. The
        title-pages are hardly less deceptive as regards the subsidiary contributions.
        This third volume, for example, is represented as consisting of " Mr. Pope''s
        Literary Correspondence, with letters to and from the Duke of Shrewsbury,
        Lord Lansdowne, the Bishop of St. Asaph, Sir Berkeley Lucy, Dean Swift, etc''
        But there is no letter to the Duke of Shrewsbury, Lord Lansdowne, or the Bishop
        of St. Asaph, who was Dr. Tanner, and only a short note each from the Duke
        and the Bishop, both of which were addressed to CurU. There is no letter from
        Sir Berkeley Lucy, and only one letter to him, and not a single letter either
        to or from Swift.] The same in duodecimo. Mr. Pope''s Literary Correspondence.
        Yol. IY. Printed by the same. [8vo. 1736. j Contains not one letter of this
        author. [Even the refuse which CurU had swept together was nearly exhausted.
        He announced on his title-page that there were letters, among others, to and
        from Addison and Bishop SmaUridge. The letters of Addison consisted of a scholastic
        discourse in Latin delivered before the University of Oxford in 1693, and
        the letters of SmaUridge were a Latin oration which he spoke in Convocation
        in 1710. In his opening address " To the Sifters " CurU stated his readiness
        to pro duce '' '' every letter he had ever printed of Mr. Pope in his own
        handwrit ing, not copied either from Twickenham or Dover Street manuscripts,"
        and he appealed to Mr. Minshul, the late librarian of Lord Oxford, in support
        of his assertion. Curll must have meant that he could produce every letter
        which he was the first to print, and must still have excluded the four letters
        of Voiture, which were professedly transcripts, unless he assumed that the
        hand of Pope was visible in the copy. The object of the bookseUer in these
        publications was not more to advance his trade than to gratify his enmity
        against the poet, and the volume abounds in the usual scurriUties. Pope, in
        1731, prefixed to his " Essay on False Taste," a prose Epistle to Lord Burlington,
        in which he defended himself from the charge of having satirised the Duke
        of Chandos under the name of Timon. This epistle was subscribed "your faithful
        affectionate servant," and he told Lord Oxford, on January 22, 1732, that
        "he had been much blamed by the formaUsts of the town " for his familiar epithet.
        The pubhc thought that Pope was parading his intimacy with a peer, and laughed
        at the foible. As little vanities are remembered when graver faults are forgotten,

        of Churchwarden of the Parish of St. Michael, Cornhill, London, questions
        were frequently brought under my official cogni zance affecting the proper
        disposition of the Revenue derived from the Parish Estates. The decisions
        from time to time arrived at appearing to me to be in some instances wanting
        in authority, I was induced to endeavour to trace out, if possible, the precise
        nature of the Original Trusts under which the several properties were held.
        With this view, and with the assistance of my friend Mr. Edwin Roffe, I procured
        a transcript of the oldest record belonging to the parish, known as the Great
        Book of Accounts. Although not altogether successful in the immediate object
        of my search, I found in the volume many matters of considerable import ance
        ; and it has been suggested to me that, whilst they would undoubtedly possess
        great value to the Parish, they might have an antiquarian and historical interest
        which would justify their circula tion even beyond its limits. Acting upon
        this suggestion, I have, with the consent of the Vestry, printed this book;
        which I now commend to the consideration of my fellow-parishioners. The superintending
        of the sheets through the press has been almost entirely the work of my friend
        Mr. W. H. Overall, the Librarian to the Corporation of London, who has also
        added the Introduction, Notes, and Index; and, I may add, but for the assistance
        of the two gentlemen above named, the task would never have been under taken

        \ Library at Edinburgh, of which Hume was librarian. He says, in his short\
        \ autobiography: 'In 1752, the Faculty of Advocates chose me their librarian,\
        \ an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me\
        \ the command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the history\
        \ of England.' It appears from his own statement that Hume wrote the portion\
        \ of his history of England which extended from the accession of the House\
        \ of Stuart to the death of Charles I. in about two years \u2014 a period\
        \ of time quite in adequate for the examination of the materials which were\
        \ then accessible, even if the writer had come to that ex amination with an\
        \ unbiassed mind, which Hume, from his own account, does not appear to have\
        \ done. For he says he thought the accession of the House of Stuart ' an epoch\
        \ when the misrepresentation of faction began chiefly to take place.' tV When\
        \ we recollect that Adam Smith has described his friend David Hume as approaching\
        \ as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the\
        \ nature of human frailty will permit, we can only account for the manner\
        \ in which Hume has drawn the character of James I. by supposing that its\
        \ darker and more repulsive features may have appeared to him to require more\
        \ conclusive evidence for belief in them than was accessible, at least to\
        \ a man of his indolent habits, when he wrote his history; and thatHume moreover\
        \ was, as I have said, though an active and fertile thinker, an indolent reader.*\

        \ John, was, at the age of 15, sent with him to Merton College, and when compelled\
        \ to leave it, went to Douay, at the instigation of a Romish priest, who sometimes\
        \ frequented the University. About this time several English Franciscans were\
        \ endeavouring to form themselves into a provincial body, and Mr. Davenport\
        \ being resolved to become one of that order, entered into his noviceship\
        \ at Ipres, October 7, 1617, which being completed, he returned to Douay,\
        \ in 1618, and joined the small convent of English Franciscans there. He was\
        \ afterwards sent to Salamanca, where in a few years he not only arrived at\
        \ a consummate knowledge in school divinity, but by a constant application\
        \ to the Scriptures, and the ancient fathers, he obtained the character of\
        \ being one of the ablest divines of his time. Returning to Douay, he was\
        \ made First Professor of Divinity in the new community, and after being distinguished\
        \ by several honourable employments in his Order, he was sent a Missionary\
        \ into England, where he went by the name of Franciscus a Sancta Clara. Here\
        \ he became Chaplain to Henrietta Maria, and sometimes appearing at Court,\
        \ the comeliness of his person, agreeableness of his conversation, and the\
        \ reputation of his learning, brought him acquainted with many of the Nobility\
        \ ; and indeed, he became highly honoured, not only by those of his profession,\
        \ but many scholars, both Protestants and Catholics. The King had a particular\
        \ respect for him, understanding that he was a divine of a reconciling temper,\
        \ and more disposed to make up breaches than widen them. Archbishop Laud also\
        \ admitted him sometimes into his conversation upon the same account, for\
        \ which both the King and Archbishop were severely censured on the breaking\
        \ out of the civil war ; and one of the articles of impeachment against Laud\
        \ charged him with this intimacy ; to which the Archbishop gave a satisfactory\
        \ explanation and reply. Davenport, about this time, found it necessary to\
        \ conceal himself, some times in London, sometimes in Flanders, and occasionally\
        \ at Oxford, where he was entertained with great civility at the public Library,\
        \ by Mr. Barlow, the Librarian. After the Restoration of Charles 2, he was\
        \ made one of Queen Catherine's Chaplains, and resided in Somerset House,\
        \ where he died, May 31, 1680, and was buried in the church belonging to the\
        \ Savoy. During this last residence in England, he was several times chosen\
        \ Provincial of his Order, being accounted the great and chief pillar thereof.\
        \ Wood, who personally knew him, thus sums up his account of him : \u2014\
        \ \" He was excellently well vers'd in school-divinity, in the fathers and\
        \ councils, in philosophers, and in ecclesi astical and profane histories.\
        \ He was a person of very free discourse, but Cressy was reserved ; of a vivacious\
        \ and quick countenance ; the other clouded and melancholick ; of a quick\
        \ apprehension, but the other not, or at least would not : all which accomplishments\
        \ made his company acceptable to great and worthy persons.\" His works were\
        \ coUected and reprinted at his own charge, in*2 vols. folio, 1665, at Douay.\

        \ On the death of his father he purchased Blythe Hall. He became acquainted\
        \ in 1630 with Sir Simon Archer, by the advice of whom, and other antiquarian\

        \ to see what was the state of opinions at the time when the Kantian doctrine\
        \ first prevailed in Germany : it was opposed at the same time to the system\
        \ of Locke, as tending to materialism, and to the school of Leibnitz, as having\
        \ reduced every thing to abstraction. The ideas of Leibnitz ' were lofty ;\
        \ but his disciples, Wolf 1 \" Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz was born in 1646,\
        \ at Leipsic, where his father was professor. Having chosen the law as his\
        \ profession, he entered the university in 1661, and in 1663 he defended for\
        \ his degree of doctor in philosophy his dissertation de principio inditidui,\
        \ a theme well character istic of the direction of his later philosophizing.\
        \ He afterwards went to Jena, and subsequently to Altdorf, where he became\
        \ doctor of laws. At Altdorf he was offered a professorship of jurisprudence,\
        \ whicii he refused. The rest of his life was unsettled and desultory, spent\
        \ for the most part in courts, where, as a versatile courtier, he was employed\
        \ in the most varied duties of diplomacy. In the year 1672 he went to Paris,\
        \ in order to induce Louis XIV to undertake the conquest of Egypt. He subsequently\
        \ visited London, whence he was afterwards called to Hanover, as councillor\
        \ of the Duke of Brunswick. He received later a post as librarian at Wol fenbiittel,\
        \ between which place and Hanover he spent the most of his sub sequent life,\
        \ though interrupted with numerous j*oumeys to Vienna, Berlin, ete. He was\
        \ intimately associated with thc Prussian Electress, Maria Charlotte, a highly\
        \ talented woman, who surrounded herself with a circle of thc most distinguished\
        \ scholars of the time, and for whom Leibnitz wrote, at her own request, his\
        \ Theodicee, In 1701, after Prussia had be come a kingdom, an academy was\
        \ established at Berlin, through his efforts, and he became its first president.\
        \ Similar, but fruitless attempts were made by him to establish academies\
        \ in Dresden and Vienna. In 1711 the title of imperial court councillor, and\
        \ a baronage, was bestowed upon him by the Emperor Charles VI. Soon aster,\
        \ he betook himself to Vienna, where he remained a considerable period, and\
        \ wrote his Monadology, at the solicitation of Prince Eugene. He died in 1716.\
        \ Next to Aristotle, Leibnitz was the most highly gifted scholar that had\
        \ ever lived ; with the richest and most extensive learning, he united the\
        \ highest and most pene trating powers of mind. Germany has reason to be proud\
        \ of him, since, after Jacob B\u0153hme, he is the first philosopher of any\
        \ note among the Germans. With him philosophy found a home in Germany. It\
        \ is to be regretted that the great variety of his efforts and literary undertakings,\
        \ together with his roving manner of life, prevented him from giving any connected\
        \ exhibition of his philosophy. His views are for tl.e most part developed\
        \ only in brief and occasional writings and letters, composed fre quently\
        \ in the French language. It is hence not easy to state his philoso phy in\
        \ its internal connection, though none of his views are isolated, but all\
        \ stand strictly connected with each other.\" \u2014 (Schwegler, History of\

    - ["101 THE FINE ARTS. Tlie second, and the finest epoch of the art of painting,\
        \ was that in which the painters preserved the truth of the middle ages, and\
        \ added to it all the more recently acquired splendor of the art : nothing\
        \ among the Germans corresponds to the age of Leo X. Towards the end of the\
        \ seventeenth century, on to the middle of the eighteenth, the fine arts almost\
        \ everywhere fell into a singular decay ; taste degenerated into affectation\
        \ : Winckelmann1 then exerted the greatest influence not only over his own\
        \ country, but over the rest of Europe ; and it was his writings which directed\
        \ the minds of different artists to the study and admiration of the monuments\
        \ of antiquity : he was better skilled in sculpture than in poetr}7 ; and\
        \ he there fore led painters into the practice of placing colored statues\
        \ in their pictures rather than the animated forms of living nature. Painting\
        \ also lost much of its charm by being so nearlv allied to sculpture ; the\
        \ illusion necessary to the one is directly con trary to the immovable and\
        \ decided forms of the other. When painters take their models exclusively\
        \ from the remains of an cient beauty, as it is only in statues that it can\
        \ be discovered, we may address to them the reproach which has been applied\
        \ 1 \"J. J. Winckelmann, the son of a poor shoemaker, was born Decem ber 9,\
        \ 1717, at Stendall, in the Altmark. He studied theology at Halle, and, in\
        \ 1743, became a schoolmaster at Seebausen. His leisure time there he gave\
        \ to the study of the ancient classics, and his thoughts were alto gether\
        \ turned towards Greece and Rome. Appointed librarian (1748) to the Count\
        \ Bunau, he had opportunities of examining tho valuable collec tion of antiquities\
        \ in Dresden, and of becoming acquainted with Lippert, Hagedorn, and Oeser,\
        \ and more deeply initiated in the fine arts. Through Cardinal Archinto, who\
        \ held out to him promotion at Koine, he became, in 1755, a convert to the\
        \ Komish faith, and secretary to the Vatican library. He hastened to Rome,\
        \ where he led for more than ten years the happy life of a man enabled to\
        \ indulge in his favorite pursuits. In 17tiS, when he returned to Germany,\
        \ to visit his friends, the sight of snow and of smoky houses drove him back\
        \ to Italy. On his way thither he was joined by an Italian who affected to\
        \ be greatly interested in numismatics, and when Winckelmann, on their arrival\
        \ at Trieste, readily displayed to him his col lection of gold coins, assassinated\
        \ him, June 8, 1768^ \"Winckelmann is founder of the school of art-criticism.\

  - - ["i XIV Life of Oliver Goldsmith. Bob Bryanstonc, afterwards, seem to have been\
        \ his only friends. The college i| life of Goldsmith is not one on which we\
        \ dwell with pleasure. His tutor, the jf Rev. Theaker Wilder, a man of some\
        \ mathematical ability, was violent in jj temper, insolent, and overbearing\
        \ in manners, and of a harsh, vicious, and >tf brutal nature. Oliver detested\
        \ mathematics, and so incurred the wrath of his U tutor, which the indolence\
        \ and thoughtlessness of the pupil gave too many Jg occasions to gratify.\
        \ He was subjected to taunts, ridicule, and insults almost || daily, sometimes\
        \ even to personal chastisement from one who, exercising over ji him the rights\
        \ of a master over a servant, persecuted him with unremitting <$a rancour.\
        \ Still Oliver was not without some white days in his college career. it More\
        \ than once he received \"the thanks of the house\" for his attendance at\
        \ If morning lecture, and this, too, in midwinter, at seven o'clock. It is\
        \ useless to IT speculate what the young man's progress might have been under\
        \ kindlier jg treatment. Brutality first outraged and then discouraged a sensitive\
        \ nature. j\\L He sought relief from his wretchedness sometimes in dissipation,\
        \ often in jl reckless disrespect of discipline \u2014 he wasted his time,\
        \ neglected his studies, and ?| dissipated the scanty supplies which his father\
        \ could afford him. But even Sf those supplies were soon to cease. Early in\
        \ 1747, that father was snatched from him. How truly the son loved and revered\
        \ the parent is proved in that A enduring and pious monument which, in after\
        \ years, he reared to his memory. vj$ The image of that father seems ever\
        \ present when he would portray J| humanity in its loveliest aspects. First\
        \ sketching him, with all his pleasant \\t foibles and large-heartedness,\
        \ in the \"Citizen of the World,\" then recurring to Jct the subject for a\
        \ fuller treatment and a more accurate delineation in the \" Vicar vl of Wakefield,\"\
        \ and at last lavishing all the riches and all the power of his love ]\\ in\
        \ the production of that portrait of the pastor in the \" Deserted Village,\"\
        \ so %* exquisite, so pathetic, so finished, and so lovely, that it seems\
        \ to this hour jj unrivalled in its excellence. Scant as were the young man's\
        \ resources before, Jft they now become scantier. His widowed mother leaves\
        \ the parsonage, and W takes a lodging in Ballymahon, living \" in low circumstances\
        \ and indifferent si health, nigra veste setiescens ;\" and he is cast pretty\
        \ much on his own ways and >K means. The genius that brutality checked was\
        \ quickened at the call of \\ \"squalid poverty.\" To supply the pressing\
        \ wants of daily life, he wrote % ballads for street minstrels. There was\
        \ a printer of the name of Hicks who 73 Forster adopted it. The building was\
        \ taken down in 1837, when the portion of the pane on which the name was written\
        \ was preserved, and is now in the manuscript room of the college. My friend,\
        \ the Rev. Dr. Todd, F.T.C.D., the learned librarian has kindly permitted\
        \ me to give a sac-simile of it {the only one ever published) in this work,\
        \ and communicated to mt the history of its preservation. When the buildings\
        \ were about being taken down, Provost Lloyd, at the suggestion of- Dr. Todd,\
        \ had the sash of the window on which the name was written removed to the\
        \ library. \" On examining it \" writes the Doctor, \" I thought it was not\
        \ the genuine scratch, which I well remembered, and I mentioned iny suspicions\
        \ to the Provost. Shortly afterwards the last occupant of the rooms sent to\
        \ the Provost the bit of glass which contained the genuine name, which you\
        \ have seen. He had attempted to cut the piece out of the window, but, owing\
        \ to the thickness of the el iss he broke it in several places, and to repair\
        \ the accident, he had the fragments put together and imbedded in a piece\
        \ of wuod \" The counterfeit pane was long shown in the library as the original,\
        \ which all the time lay safely locked up in the MS room", 1]

        \ was not fully organized until 1833 or 1834, at which time it included the\
        \ entire township of Vance (as it was then called), and said town ship comprised\
        \ the entire county of Hillsdale, which was then attached to and formed a\
        \ part of Lenawee County. The loss of early records, and the loose manner\
        \ in which those which have been preserved were kept, renders it impossible\
        \ to give with accuracy the names of officers of the district or teachers\
        \ of the school for a number of years after it was organized. It would seem\
        \ that Benaiah Jones, one of the first settlers in the county, who laid out\
        \ and gave name to the village, and his brother-in-law, James Olds, were the\
        \ first officers, hired the first teachers, furnished the school room, and\
        \ boarded the teachers. The school was opened in the fall of 1832 by Dr. William\
        \ Mottram, in a bedroom in a block tavern kept by Benaiah Jones, and which\
        \ stood on the northwest corner of what are now known as Chicago and Waters\
        \ Streets, on lot 24, Jones' Plat of Jonesville. Dr. Mottram kept the school\
        \ but a few weeks, and was succeeded by Dr. Chase, who taught during the remainder\
        \ of the winter and the next spring. The entire village at that time consisted\
        \ of one log taverns four log dwellings, one small frame dwelling, and two\
        \ log barns. \" The district appears to have been first organized as a union\
        \ school district in 1843, when the township of Scipio, comprising a part\
        \ of ihe territory of the district, appears to have been organized. \xA7 Among\
        \ the earliest preserved records of the district we find a vote, April 19,\
        \ 1838, to raise by tax on the property of the district $62, to be used, so\
        \ far as necessary, for the instruction of indigent pupils ; and from that\
        \ time forward, so long as the school was in part supported by rate bills,\
        \ we find each year liberal amounts voted to be raised by tax for instruction\
        \ of indigent pupils ; and we find abundant evidence from the records, aside\
        \ from the traditions of the school, that no child has ever been debarred\
        \ from any of its benefits by reason of poverty. From the directors' report,\
        \ made Oct. 7, 1840, we find there were then in the district, of school age\
        \ : between 5 and 17, 86 ; attending school under 5 or over 17, 9 ; total\
        \ in district, 95 ; attending district school, 84. There was at the same time\
        \ a private school kept in the village, where the rest were no doubt taught.\
        \ \" In the fall of 1847 the first two-story union brick school-house, erected\
        \ under the general school laws of the State, was completed on the west half\
        \ of the present school house lot, at a cost of about $3000, being 30 by 60\
        \ feet, two stories high, with cupola and bell; and the school was opened\
        \ in the new building by A. S Welch, a graduate of Michigan University, and\
        \ under his able management became, and has since continued, one of the best\
        \ union or graded schools in the State. At the annual meeting, Sept. 24, 1849,\
        \ the district was reorganized under the law passed the previous winter, authorizing\
        \ districts containing more than 100 scholars to enlarge the board by the\
        \ election, in addition to the three officers previously allowed, of four\
        \ trustees, making the school board consist of seven members. The two-story\
        \ school-house was found insufficient for the wants of the district, aud in\
        \ 1859 additional ground was purchased east of the school-house, making grounds\
        \ 16 rods on Chicago Street by 12 rods on East Street, and steps were taken\
        \ for the erection of a new school building. At \" In the fall of 1833 a log\
        \ house, known as the ' Bell House,' which stood on what is now Maumee Street,\
        \ and a little north of the present Methodist church, was fitted up for a\
        \ school- house, by boring holes into logs and laying boards upon wooden pins\
        \ driven into them for desks, and school was taught for five months by Benjamin\
        \ L. Baxter, then a lad of eighteen. Among those who attended his school were\

        of Messrs. Skardon and Sons, the enterprising auctioneers. The principal room
        (up-stairs) is a fine apartment, and was tastefully decorated. Here for some
        time musical gatherings took place, and the building was the centre of much
        of the literary life of the town. We now pass through the Market gates, and

        arrangement or appearance of effected buildings. Tbe Market in fact, is large

        probable that, ere long, the Town Council, having overcome the burden of providing

        with a fine street running through it, as a continuation of the street we
        have just left. Such a scheme has been mooted, and will, doubtless, soon be
        made a reality. The Market, which was opened in 1804, occupies an area of
        three acres, and contains covered vegetable, butter, fish, and poultry markets,

        of the Library and its contents must suffice. The Library contains about 10,000
        volumes in all departments of literature. They are arranged on shelves around
        the walls, to the height of 16 feet, while in the centre is a block of shelving
        lately added, and the Issuing Desk. On either side of the centre space is
        placed the " Library Indicator," an ingenious contrivance by which borrowers
        are enabled to select their books, with very little trouble to themselves
        or the attendants. Each book or volume has a separate place in the " Indicator,"
        and by means of coloured slips of board the borrower can see at a glance whither
        the book he requires is in or not, and the reason of its absence. The plan
        works admirably. The average daily issues in the lending department exceed
        400 volumes, and in the period between the opening of the Lending Library,
        October, 1876, to the end of the year 1878, about a quarter of a million of
        volumes were issued. The Reference Library is small, and not yet developed.
        Arrangements are now being made to give further accommodation in the present
        building, which will have the effect of giving the much-needed accom- modation
        for a Reference Library, as well as of increasing the news-rooms and general
        reading-rooms. The entrance of the news-room is opposite that of the Library
        on the same landing, and is fitted up in the most approved style. Many of
        the daily and weekly journals are placed upon stands, and on the tables are
        arranged the monthlies and quarterlies, as well as many weekly publications.
        These rooms are very popular, and are thronged at all hours of the day. The
        Public Librarian is Mr. W. H. K. Wright, Fellow of the Royal Historical Society,

        185 1 it has been kept in a room, provided and fur nished for it by its directors,
        in the Congregational meeting-house. The books furnished to the people of
        Hollis from this library have been of great use to them, from the time of
        its foundation, in the promotion of useful knowledge and in cultivating and
        supplying a taste for reading among the inhabitants generally, the extent
        of which may in some measure be seen from the fact stated in one of the last
        annual reports, that in the preceding year there had been given out to be
        read between twenty-four hundred and twenty-five hundred volumes, the same
        book, however, in many instances, having been given out more than once. THE
        HOLLIS LYCEUM AND PUBLIC LECTURES During most of the winters since 1851, either
        lyceums or courses of public lectures have been maintained in Hollis for the
        intellec tual entertainment and improvement of its citizens. The constitu
        tion of the lyceum has commonly provided for a monthly election of its officers,
        and also for its exercises, including select readings and recitations, vocal
        and instrumental music, a discussion of some topic or question of general
        interest to its members, and a paper, known as the " Lyceum Reporter," edited
        by some of its lady mem bers, appointed for that purpose. The exercises of
        this association have usually been public. Separate committees have ordinarily
        provided for the selection of the subjects for these exercises, and the assignment
        and acceptance of their various parts, and when these duties of the committees
        have been faithfully performed, the public interest in them has been so general
        as to insure a large attendance at the meetings. The public lectures have
        commonly been provided for by volun tary subscriptions of the citizens, and
        have been free to all who wished to attend them. They have embraced a great
        variety of subjects of interest, and some of the lecturers engaged have been
        persons of distinction in this and other States. Also a club for the rehearsal
        and acting of dramas has occasionally existed, and public entertainments given

        led me to waive my objections to undertaking the task and going on with the

        I may be permitted to say, was a sincere filial regard, not to say veneration,
        for the memory and character of the early settlers of the town as shown by
        the records of their doings, among whom, and its inhabitants afterwards, were
        three generations of both my paternal and maternal ancestors. I also participated
        in the sen timent felt and expressed by man}'' others that it was but doing
        tardy justice to their memories, that their history should now be written,
        accompanied by the fear, also often expressed by those interested. that otherwise
        it might not be soon, if ever, done. In my view it would also be needless,
        as well as tedious, here to enumerate the many books and public documents
        which have been consulted in the collecting of the facts presented in this
        history. The references to them, at least for the most part, will si ff.ciently

        that it has been my aim to gather these facts from all such pertinent original
        documents as were at my command, and from all other sources that seemed to
        me authentic and trustworthy, whether boohs, letters of correspondents or
        well-established tradition. It has been said by a late author. " that one
        must write a book to know how courteous the world can be." It has been my
        fortune in the compilation of this history very fully and most cordially to
        appreciate that sentiment, and I take unfeigned pleasure in expres sing my
        grateful acknowledgements to the very many correspon. dents who have aided

        \ What a blessed fire-side ! How happy should I be to pass a winter evening\
        \ under their venerable roof ! and smoke a pipe of tobacco, or drink water-gruel\
        \ with them ! What solemn, lengthened, laughter-quashing gravity of phiz!\
        \ What sage remarks on the good-for-nothing sons and daughters of indiscretion\
        \ and folly ! And what frugal lessons, as we straitened the fire-side circle\
        \ on the uses of the poker and tongs ! Miss N. is very well, and begs to be\
        \ remembered in the old way to you. I used all my eloquence, all the persuasive\
        \ flourishes of the hand, and heart-melting modulation of periods in my power,\
        \ to urge her out to Harvieston, but all in vain. My rhetoric seems quite\
        \ to have lost its effect on the lovely half of mankind. I have seen the day\
        \ \u2014 but that is a \" tale of other years.\" \u2014 In my con science\
        \ I believe that my heart has been so oft on fire that it is absolutely vitrified.\
        \ I look on the sex with something like the admiration with which I regard\
        \ the starry sky in a frosty Decem ber night. I admire the beauty of the Creator's\
        \ workmanship ; I am charmed with the wtid but graceful eccentricity of their\
        \ motions, and \u2014 wish them good night. I mean this with respect to a\
        \ certain passion dont j'ai eu I'honneur d'etre un miserable esclave: as for\
        \ friendship, you and Char lotte have given me pleasure, permanent pleasure,\
        \ \" which the world cannot give, nor take away \" I hope ; and which will\
        \ outlast the heavens and the earth. B. B. LXXXI. TO MISS MARGARET CHALMERS.\
        \ [That fine song, \" The Banks of the Devon,\" dedi cated to the charms of\
        \ Charlotte Hamilton, was en closed in the foUowing letter.] Without date.\
        \ I have been at Dumfries, and at one visit more shall be decided about a\
        \ farm in that country. I am rather hopeless in it ; but as my brother is\
        \ an excellent farmer, and is, besides, an exceedingly prudent, sober man\
        \ (qualities which are only a younger brother's fortune in our family), I\
        \ am determined, if my Dumfries business fail me, to return into partnership\
        \ with him, and at our leisure take another farm in the neighbourhood. I assure\
        \ you I look for high compliments from you and Charlotte on this very sage\
        \ instance of my unfathomable, incomprehensible wisdom. Talking of Charlotte,\
        \ I mu'st tell her that I have, to the best of my power, paid her a poetic\
        \ com pliment, now completed. The air is admirable : true old Highland. It\
        \ was the tune of a Gaelic song, which an Inverness lady sung me when I was\
        \ there ; and I was so charmed with it that I begged her to write me a set\
        \ of it from her sing ing ; for it had never been set before. I am fixed that\
        \ it shall go in Johnson's next number; so Charlotte and you need not spend\
        \ your precious time in contradicting me. I won't say the poetry is first-rate\
        \ ; though I am convinced it is very weU ; and, what is not alw*ays the case\
        \ with com pliments to ladies, it is not only sincere, but just. R. B. LXXXII.\
        \ TO JAMES HOY, ESQ., GORDON CASTLE. [James Hoy, librarian of Gordon Castle,\
        \ was, it is said, the gentleman whom his grace of Gordon sent with a message\
        \ inviting in vain that \" obstinate son of Latin prose,\" Nicol, to stop\
        \ and enjoy himself.] Edinburgh, 20th October, 1787. Sir, I will defend my\
        \ conduct in giving you this trouble, on the best of Christian principles\
        \ \u2014 \" Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so\
        \ unto them.\" \u2014 I shall certainly, among my legacies, leave my latest\
        \ curse to that unlucky predicament which hurried \u2014 tore me away from\
        \ Castle Gordon. May that obstinate son of Latin prose [Nicol] be curst to\
        \ Scotch mile periods, and damned to seven league paragraphs ; while Declension\
        \ and Conjugation, Gender, Num ber, and Time, under the ragged banners of\
        \ Dis sonance and Disarrangement, eternally rank against him in hostile array.\
        \ Allow me, Sir, to strengthen the small claim I have to your acquaintance,\
        \ by the following request. An engraver, James Johnson, in Edin burgh, has,\
        \ not from mercenary views, but from an honest Scotch enthusiasm, set about\
        \ collecting all our native songs and setting them to music ; particularly\
        \ those that have never been set before. Clarke, the well-known musician,\
        \ presides over the musical arrangement, and Drs. Beattie and Blacklock, Mr.\
        \ Tytler of Woodhouselee, and your humble servant to the utmost of his small\
        \ power, assist in coUecting the old poetry, or sometimes for a fine air make\
        \ a stanza, when it has no words. The brats, too tedious to mention, claim\
        \ a parental pang from my hardship. I sup pose it will appear in Johnson's\
        \ second number \u2014 the first was published before my acquaintance with\
        \ him. My request is \u2014 \" Cauld Kail in Aber-", 1]

        Dr. Daniel, Jr., Israel (who had two wives and was the father of twenty-two
        children), Tilly, William, and Mr. Orrick H. Early in life he learned the
        business of tanning leather in Nunda, and afterward that of currier in Seneca
        Falls, N. Y., where he was for some time employed. Moving to Springfield,
        Mass., in September, 1845 he engaged as foreman in Mr. Bliss'' tannery, but
        began deal ing in " paper stock" in 1847, and opened the first paper ware
        house in the Connecticut Valley, in 1848, at Springfield, under the firm-name
        of "Greenleaf & Taylor" (Mr. Taylor being his brother-in-law). They soon did
        the largest business in Western Massachusetts in their line, and in 1853 they
        built a mill at Huntington, Mass., for the manufacture of printers'' paper.
        In 1854, Mr. Greenleaf organized the " Greenleaf & Taylor Manufacturing Company."
        In 1859, Mr. Taylor re tired from the company. They purchased in Springfield
        the mill formerly owned by D. and J. Ames, and changed the Huntington mill
        to one for fine writing-paper. While the business was under the management
        of Mr. Greenleaf it proved very successful, but in 1868 he disposed of his
        interest, having become previously largely interested in the manufac ture
        of paper elsewhere. In 1865 he purchased of Stephen Holman and others a controlling
        interest for himself and friends in the " Holyoke Piper Company," since which
        time its business has been under his management. He was elected to the General
        Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1856, and was one of the leaders
        on the anti-slavery side in the great controversy then going on in relation
        to slavery in the church. He was also a delegate to the General Conference
        of 1870, taking an active part in its proceedings, and serving on various
        important committees. At this session, provision was made for the appointment
        of a committee to revise the Methodist hymn-book. Dr. Rice was selected as
        a member of this committee, and devoted much time and attention to the work.
        When the revision was com pleted, he was appointed chairman ofthe editorial
        committee, under whose supervision the hymnal was published. This re vised
        hymnal has received the commendation of the bishops, and the high appreciation
        in which it is held by the Metho dist Church is indicated by its immense circulation.
        Dr. Rice has given attention, also, to other literary work. He published,
        some years ago, a "Pastor''s Manual," for the use of clergymen, and an octavo
        volume of " Moral and Re ligious Quotations from the Poets," containing more
        than four thousand selections, topically arranged. These works have been highly
        commended by the press, and widely circulated. He also prepared and published
        the excellent catalogue of the Springfield City Library, still in use. In
        1853 the Wesleyan University conferred upon him the honorary degree of A.M.,
        and in 1876 the degree of D.D. Soon after this purchase he began the enlargement
        of the mill to a capacity of seven tons per day, being a larger amount of
        fine writing-paper than is manufactured by any other single mill in the countrj-.
        This corporation has been emi nently successful, owing largely to Mr. Greenleaf''s
        careful oversight and business ability, its goods standing at the head of
        the market. For eighteen years Dr. Rice has been secretary of the trus tees
        of the Wesle}''an Academy, and for many years a trustee of the college at
        Middletown. He has been a member of the school committee of tbe city of Springfield
        for the past fifteen years, and a member of the State board of education for
        six teen years. During that period he has devoted much time and labor to the
        work of popular education. Dr. Rice has been very closely connected with the
        histor}'' of the City Library in Springfield. In its early days he was un
        tiring in his labors in its behalf, soliciting subscriptions to its funds,
        donations of books, and seeking, by persistent and self-sacrificing efforts,
        to secure its growth and permanent es tablishment. Later in its history he
        co-operated heartily with the few noble men whose zeal and labor to secure
        a suitable building for tbe ingathered literature resulted in the erection
        of the beautiful library edifice on State Street. Having beeu the librarian
        since the year 1861, almost from the beginning of tbe present library, the
        selection and purchase of books, and their arrangement and classification,
        have devolved en tirely upon him. His wide range of reading, liberal views,
        cultivated literary taste, and sound judgment eminently fitted him for this
        work, and have given to the library in a great degree its present high position
        and established reputation. During the present year it received a gold medal
        at Paris for these specialties (linen and parchment papers). Mr. Green leaf
        has been a director in the First National Bank of Spring field since its organization,
        and is interested in other enter prises. He began the erection of his present
        fine residence in 1872, and finished it the following year. It is situated
        on Crescent Hill, Springfield, overlooking the city and adjacent country toward
        the Berkshire Hills, and commanding a charming view both up and down the Connecticut
        Valley, the one to the south extending many miles into Connecticut. This residence
        is one of the finest in Western Massachusetts. Mr. Greenleaf has been a member
        of the Baptist Church for many years, and of the First Baptist Church of Springfield
        thirty-four years. Unlike many of our wealthy men, he has believed that while
        living he could dispose of his income in part, and during the last dozen years
        has given more than seventy thousand dollars for various public and private
        pur poses. In 1847 he was married to Miss Mary Ann, daughter of Robert Baldwin,
        Esq., of East Windsor, Conn. In the year 1843, Dr. Rice was married to Caroline
        L., daughter of Wm. North, of Lowell, Mass. She was a lady of superior culture,
        and has been a helpmeet to her husband in all his varied work. Their children
        are Rev. Wm. North Rice, Ph.D., professor in the Wesleyan University, Middle
        town, Conn. ; Edward H. Rice, Ph.D., classical teacher in the Worcester High
        School ; Rev. Charles F. Rice, A.M., a min ister in the Methodist Episcopal
        Church ; and Caroline L. Rice, a member of the senior class in the Wesleyan
        Univer sity. DANIEL B. WESSON was born in Worcester, Worcester Co., Mass.,
        May, 1825. The family of Wesson settled in the town of Worcester over a cen
        tury ago. Abel, great-grandfather of Mr. D. B. Wesson, was the first settler,
        and for four generations they were among the prominent families of that place.
        His father, Rufus Wesson, followed the occupation of making wooden plows during
        his early days, and only abandoned tbe trade when iron plows came into use.
        He spent the remainder of his days as a farmer. He lived to be eighty-seven
        years of age. and died in his native town in the year 1874. His mother, Betsy
        Baird, who was descended from one of tbe oldest and most prominent families
        of Worcester, survived her husband about two years, and died at the age of
        eighty-eight, in the year 1876. The children of this family were five sons
        and five daughters, of whom four sons and three daughters are living. The
        eldest son, Edwin, died in Hartford thirty years ago. His name ORRICK HERMAN
        GREENLEAF was born in Nunda, N. Y., July 18, 1823. He was one of the nine
        children of William Greenleaf, of Nunda, N. Y., and Almira Sanford, of Vermont,
        and is one of the ninth generation after Edmund Greenleaf, who came from England
        and settled in Newbury, Mass., in 1634, from whom all ofthe Greenleafs in
        America are believed to have descended. The family is of Huguenot stock originally.
        Mr. Greenleaf''s lino of descent in America is as follows : Edmund, who settled
        in Newbury in 1634; Stephen, who came to America with bis', 1]

        \ the statements of his students, it is hardly possible to speak too highly\
        \ of his piet\\-, learning, sound judgment, and the grace and dignity of his\
        \ manner. He was equally distinguished for the skill with which he conducted\
        \ the varied interests of a great school or college, and for a most impressive,\
        \ convincing, and persuasive eloquence in the pulpit.* Before the days of\
        \ normal schools it had a class for the training of teachers, and for many\
        \ years each winter from 50 to 80 went out to give instruction in the schools\

        \ missionary work. With such material for students, there is of course much\
        \ earnest work done, and the school has a salutary moral and religious atmosphere.\
        \ Bev. David Patten, D. D., Bev. Charles Adams, D.D., and Rev. Robert Allyn,\
        \ D.D., have each spent many years in la borious and successful educational\
        \ work since leaving the academy. Rev. Miner Raymond, D.D., presided over\
        \ the academy sixteen years, \u2014 longer than any other principal. He was\
        \ connected with the school as pupil, teacher, and principal some twenty-five\
        \ years. During his administration the present magnificent and commodious\
        \ buildings were erected, and the institution prospered in all its interests.\
        \ For fifteen yeare Dr. Raymond has been professor of theology in the Biblical\
        \ Institute, at Evanston, 111. He has recently published a vtsry able and\
        \ elaborate work on \"Systematic Theology.\" Government. \u2014 The guardianship\
        \ and general management of the school is in the hands of a board of trustees,\
        \ consisting of about 30 members. This body elects its own members. It meets\
        \ yearly; but for cases of emergency it chooses a pruden linl committee, or\
        \ local board, to act with full powers in the interim of the yearly sessions.\
        \ This committee is composed of men who reside either in Springfield or Wilbraham,\
        \ or some place easy of access to Wilbraham. To watch over its present educational\
        \ growth and advancement, a visiting board is appointed by the patronizing\
        \ Conferences, the New Eng land and the New York East. The committee for term\
        \ examinations is usually chosen by the teachers. Libraries, Cabinets, etc.\
        \ \u2014 There are libraries connected with the academy, and also with each\
        \ of the 4 literary societies. The number of volumes is 6306. Dr. Edward Cooke\
        \ came to Wilbraham with the wisdom acquired from a long experience at the\
        \ head of similar in-ti tutions, which eminently fitted him to improve, organize,\
        \ and classify the school so that it compares favorably with the best scientific\
        \ and classical schools of New England. Dr. Cooke is now president of Claflin\
        \ University, South Carolina. There are several collections in tho department\
        \ of natural history, containing about 500 specimens of plants, 800 geo logical\
        \ B] imens, and numerous fossils; the collection of birds is especially good.\
        \ The philosophical apparatus includes, among other things, a lever air-pump,\
        \ a 5-inch telescope, plate electrical machine, magneto-electric and galvanic\
        \ bat teries, spectroscope, compound microscope, etc. The mathe matical apparatus\
        \ includes a line transit instrument, compass, level, quadrant, sextant, etc.\
        \ The art-room has the finest location of any in the academy, but is entirely\
        \ without fur nishings, save a few busts, chromos, and paintings, used as\
        \ models. There is a fine hall in the music building devoted to gymnastic\
        \ purposes, supplied with Indian-clubs, dumb-bells, etc., etc. A very excellent\
        \ reading-room is connected with the school, abundantly supplied with dailies,\
        \ weeklies, month lies, and quarterlies, secular and religious. The music\
        \ de partment is supplied with 10 new pianos, one a concert grand, with pipe-organs\
        \ and a cabinet-organ. Lyceums, etc. \u2014 There are four literary societies\
        \ connected with the school. The oldest is the \" Young Men's Debating Club\
        \ and Lyceum,\" established in 1825. A scion of this is tho \"Union Philosophical\
        \ Society,\" formed in 1832. The two ladies' societies were formed, as they\
        \ now stand, in 1851. They arc named \" Athena\" and \"Pieria.\" Such a pleasant\
        \ rivalry has always existed between them that they have always been prosperous\
        \ and thoroughly active. \" Club\" and ' Philo\" are old familiar names to\

        \ physician was descended from James Deane, one of the earliest settlers of\
        \ Stonington, Conn. Christopher and Prudence Deane, his father and mother,\
        \ removed from Stonington early in their married life to Coleraine, Franklin\
        \ Co., Mass., where the subject of this notice was born, on the 24th of February,\
        \ 1801, being the eighth child of the family* The home of his childhood, which\
        \ was a very humble one, was situated near the summit of one of the picturesque\
        \ hills of Western Massachusetts, within full view of the Grand Monadnock\
        \ and the lesser up lift of gray Wachusett, while the whole vast horizon was\
        \ bounded by a magnificent line of undulating hills and moun tains, with the\
        \ intervening space filled up with quiet vales and beautiful pastoral scenery.\
        \ He was from his early years a close student of Nature, watching the growth\
        \ of the forest trees, pondering the multitudinous forms in which she arrayed\
        \ herself, and adapting himself but indifferently to the busy duties of farm-life.\
        \ His education was such as the district schools of the time afforded, supplemented\
        \ by one term at the then somewhat noted Deerfield Academy. He also, as his\
        \ tastes developed, was allowed the privilege of taking lessons in the Latin\
        \ language, under the instruction of Isaac B. Barber, Esq., an attorney of\
        \ his native town.f This last re quired a daily journey of three miles on\
        \ foot through the woods. The entire family were studiously inclined, as is\
        \ illus trated by the fact that each ofthe sons became in turn teacher in\
        \ the district school, while three of them studied medicine. He became a fellow\
        \ of the Massachusetts Medical Associa tion in 1814, and was one of its counselors\
        \ for twenty-five years. He took an active part in the formation of the Franklin\
        \ District Medical Society, founded in 1851, was one of its counselors, and\
        \ served for some time as librarian. In 1813 he was elected an honorary member\
        \ of the American Eseulapian Society of New York. In 1825 he received the\
        \ honorary degree of Doctor of Medicine from Williams Col lege ; in 1849 was\
        \ appointed by the Massachusetts Medical Association a delegate to tbe American\
        \ Medical Association ; and in January, 1851, was elected first president\
        \ of tbe Frank lin District Medical Society. Dr. Stone died Sept. 5, 1851,\
        \ aged seventy-three years and four months. He was three times married. His\
        \ first wife was a daughter of Beriah Willard, Esq., of Greenfield; his second\
        \ was Har riett Russell, of Rutland, Mass.; and his third, Mrs. Fanny Gushing\
        \ Arms, widow of George Arms, Esq., of Deerfield, whom he married about 1820.\
        \ His son, Charles Stone, was a graduate of West Point, and served during\
        \ the Mexican war with distinction, rising to the rank of captain in the regular\
        \ army. Subsequently he visited Europe to perfect his military studies. At\
        \ the opening of the great Rebellion in 1861 he took an active and prominent\
        \ part, and received the commission of brigadier-general of volun teers. He\
        \ commanded at the disastrous battle of Ball's Bluff, which reverse to the\
        \ Union arms was more the result of errors on the part of the War Department\
        \ than of any fault in the commander. He soon after retired from the service,\
        \ and subsequently visited Europe and Egypt, where he entered the army of\
        \ the khedive, and has, by his thorough military knowledge and soldierly qualities,\
        \ won the high distinction of virtual Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian army.\
        \ When James was nineteen years of age his father finally gave up the idea\
        \ of making a farmer of him, and consented that he might seek a more congenial\
        \ occupation. He accord ingly made his way to that goal of a Yankee's boy's\
        \ ambition, the wonderful city of Boston, scarcely comprehending what he wanted\
        \ or why he went. He was disappointed in finding employment, and after a few\
        \ days' absence returned to his father's house. About all the remark he made\
        \ of the trip was, that \"he had met with some lonesome places.\" Dr. Samuel\
        \ Stearns, son of Charles Stearns, was born in Leyden, Franklin Co., Mass.,\
        \ June 29, 1792. He studied medicine with Dr. Samuel Norris, of Homer, CortlandCo.,\
        \ N. Y., for two years, and afterward with Dr. George Wins low, of Coleraine,\
        \ Franklin Co., Mass. Sept. 22, 1816, he married Luseba, daughter of Capt.\
        \ Edward Adams, of Cole raine. He practiced medicine in Brookfield, Madison\
        \ Co., N. Y., and New Haven, Vt., previous to the year 1821, at which date\
        \ he returned to Coleraine, where he remained until 1835, when he removed\
        \ to Greenfield, Franklin Co., Mass., where he continued the practice of his\
        \ profession until about the year 1860, when he became incapacitated, by reason\
        \ of spinal disease, from active business. This difficulty was super induced\
        \ by a fall from a load of hay. His death occurred on the 16th of June, 1867,\
        \ at the age of seventy-five years. But he could not content himself upon\
        \ the farm, and upon arriving at his majority he bade adieu to his home, and,\
        \ coming to Greenfield, offered his services to Elijah Alvord, Esq., then\
        \ clerk ofthe courts and register of Probate. Here he remained during the\
        \ four succeeding years, which were among the happiest of his life. While\
        \ in the employ of Mr. Alvord, he began the study of medicine as a pupil of\
        \ Dr. Brigham, an eminent practitioner of Greenfield, spending a few hours\
        \ of each day in this pur suit. In 1829-30 he attended his first course of\
        \ medical lec tures, given by Professors Delafield, Stevens, Smith, Beck,\
        \ and others, of New York. He received the degree of M.D. in March, 1831,\
        \ and immediately afterward commenced prac tice in Greenfield, where he soon\
        \ established an excellent rep utation as a physician and surgeon, and eventually\
        \ built up a large practice. A number of respectable medical gentlemen, at\
        \ various periods, located in the place, but retired from com petition with\
        \ him after brief experience. His success was steady and sure, and he soon\
        \ took the first rank as a surgeon in this vicinity. Christopher Deane, M.D.,\
        \ was a native of Stonington, Conn., where he was born on the 12th of August,\
        \ 1783. At an early age he removed with his father to Coleraine, Frank lin\
        \ Co., Mass., where the family settled on a farm. His edu cation was obtained\
        \ at the common district school and at the Deerfield Academy. Succeeding his\
        \ school-days he taught a district school during the winter months for several\
        \ years, and studied medicine with Dr. Samuel Ross, the first settled physician\
        \ of the town of Coleraine. He commenced practice about the year 1807, and\
        \ continued uninterruptedly until his death, July 25, 1854, a period of almost\
        \ half a century. His practice grew to extensive proportions, though the remunera\
        \ tion was somewhat disproportioned to the amount of labor performed. He possessed\
        \ an excellent library for those days, and kept himself fully abreast of the\
        \ progress of the age, and, probably, somewhat in advance of his contemporaries\
        \ in country practice. He was a man of unassuming manners, quiet and gentlemanly\
        \ in his bearing toward all. His services in the department of surgery, and\
        \ in rare and difficult cases of disease, were in demand over a region cover\
        \ ing a radius of thirty miles around Greenfield. He felt the need of additional\
        \ knowledge, and in 1849 spent several weeks in New York, studying the latest\
        \ and most approved works, and bringing himself fully up with the advance\
        \ thoughts of the time. This was subsequently of immense advantage to him.\
        \ His experience as a contributor to the press began in 1837, with a communication\
        \ to the Boston Mi, Heal and Surgical Journal, and continued until January,\
        \ 1855, during which He married Sarah, daughter of Dr. Samuel Ross, by whom\
        \ he had thirteen children, \u2014 six sons and seven daughters. His sons\
        \ were all business or professional men, only two of whom are now living,\

        \ stationed at Barre, in September, 1839, under the direction of Prof. Samuel\
        \ P. Newman, who died in 1842. In 1844 the school was removed to Westfield,\
        \ and was in that year and in 1845 under the charge of Rev. Emerson Davis.\
        \ In September, 1846, the present structure was first occupied by tbe school.\
        \ The original building cost $6500, of which the State appropriated $2500,\
        \ the town $500, the central school district $1500, and private subscriptions\
        \ the residue. Later, in 1861 and 1869, the building was remodeled and materially\
        \ extended by the State, at an additional expense of upward of $25,000. Previous\
        \ to the erection of the Normal School build ing the sessions were held in\
        \ the basement of the Westfield Academy, and in the Westfield town-hall. Tuition\
        \ is free to every pupil who gives a pledge to teach school in the State.\
        \ Others are required to pay a tuition-fee. The pupils num bered, in 1878,\
        \ 110, and the corps of instructors 7, in addition to the principal. The course\
        \ of study is a thorough one, is intended to be such as shall fit any scholar\
        \ for college, and covers a period of two years. A supplemental course of\
        \ two years is provided for graduates of the regular course. Con nected with\
        \ the school (supported by the State to the extent of $500 annually) is a\
        \ School of Observation, a valuable library, apparatus for the illustration\
        \ of the important principles in the natural sciences, a cabinet of mineral,\
        \ geological, and zoological specimens, a chemical laboratory, and a handsomely\
        \ appointed art-room. Adjacent to the school building is the Normal School\
        \ boarding-house, an elegant brick mansion, erected by the State in 1873-74,\
        \ at a cost of $84,000, with ac commodations for 130 scholars. In 1878 it\
        \ had 70 inmates. They were further empowered to hold the donation of Samuel\
        \ Mather, and all other donations, etc., to be thereafter made, and to purchase\
        \ and hold real estate to an amount not exceeding $30,000, and personal estate\
        \ to an amount not ex ceeding $100,000. The first meeting for organization\
        \ was held Dec. 15, 1866, and immediately thereupon Mr. Mather delivered to\
        \ the treasurer of the corporation $10,000 in United States bonds as a fund\
        \ whose income should be applied toward the salary of librarian, and the heating\
        \ and lighting of the library. In that year Mr. Harrison erected the present\
        \ library building, at a cost of $10,000, and presented it, with the land\
        \ it occupies, to the Atheneum, in pursuance of a cherished desire to pro\
        \ mote, in WTestfield, the growth of such an institution. Shortly after this,\
        \ private subscriptions, aggregating $10,000, were made by citizens of Westfield,\
        \ and persons from abroad, who lived here formerly, the largest of these donations\
        \ being that of Mr. Henry T. Morgan, of New York City. In 1872, Mrs. John\
        \ B. Eldredge, of Hartford, donated $1000 to the Atheneum. These donations\
        \ were for the purpose of purchasing books, etc., for tbe library, while there\
        \ have been privately donated as well, to this time, upward of twelve hundred\
        \ volumes. There are at present in the library 9200 bound volumes. The library\
        \ was opened to the public Jan. 1, 1868, and has since then been kept continuously\
        \ open. Periodicals and daily newspapers are kept on file, which visitors\
        \ to the library may read free of charge. There is a nominal charge of $2\
        \ per year for the privilege of withdrawing books from the library. The annual\
        \ revenue from this source is about $450. The library has been in charge of\
        \ P. L. Buell, Esq., as librarian, since May, 1873. The list of principals\
        \ from 1844 to 1878 is as follows ; Em erson Davis, David S. Rowe, Wm. H.\
        \ Wells, J. W. Dickin son, and Joseph G. Scott. From the foundation of the\

        \ The cemetery is beautified with smooth and well-kept drives and foot-paths,\
        \ abounds in the luxuriant shade of hundreds of pines, and promises to become\

        \ at West Farms, one at West Parish, and another north of Westfield village,\
        \ belonging to the Catholic Church. Among the citizens of Westfield who have\

        \ A special effort was made to increase the number of annual subscriptions,\

        \ of the association from all sources from 1857 to 1871, when the library\
        \ was removed to the new building, amounted to about \xA750,000, and a large\

        \ of $100,000, and the library was opened to the public in the fall of the\
        \ same year. The library building is on State Street. It is 100 feet long\
        \ and 65 feet deep, standing some 12 or 15 feet above the general level of\
        \ the street, and 60 feet back from the front of the lot. Two flights of broad\
        \ granite steps ascend from the street to an arched stone porch before the\
        \ central tower. The building is of Monson gneiss to the height of the water-table\
        \ ; above, it is constructed of good faced brick, relieved by strongly con\
        \ trasting and richly cut and carved light sandstone, from quar ries at Amherst,\
        \ O. The graceful porch, the bay-windows on the west and east ends, the arch-stones,\
        \ panels, moldings, bands, dormers, and tracery are all of this delicate-tinted\
        \ stone. The roof is the most peculiar and picturesque feature of the building,\
        \ and is trimmed with light iron tinials and railings, decorated and gilded.\
        \ The architecture is the mod ern adaptation of the Gothic, prevalent in the\
        \ Middle Ages on the continent, and in England at the present time, and is\
        \ known as the medi\xE6val revival.* It is admirably adapted to isolated public\
        \ buildings like this, by its free and varied out line and its opportunity\
        \ for elaborate ornamentation. The entrance-hall is 25 feet wide, extending\
        \ from front to rear of the building. Opening from the hall on the right is\
        \ the museum-room, 20 by 50 feet, furnished with alcoves and cases. On the\
        \ west is a similar though smaller hall, to be used as a reading-room, while\
        \ beyond, and also entered from the entrance-hall, is the janitor's room.\
        \ A museum of Ethnology and Natural Histor}- was founded in 1859, under the\
        \ auspices of the association, in which were gathered collections of much\
        \ interest and value, especially in some departments of local zoology. The\
        \ rooms in the city hall, ample at first, soon became crowded by the rapid\
        \ growth of the library and museum, and the necessity for more commodious\
        \ quarters became obvious. It was now apparent that the library was an established\
        \ insti tution, and it was felt that provision should be made for its per\
        \ manent accommodation and its continued growth. The associa tion was therefore\
        \ reorganized under a new charter, which con stituted it a corporation for\
        \ the purpose of \" establishing and maintaining a library for the diffusion\
        \ of knowledge and the promotion of intellectual improvement in the city of\
        \ Spring field.\" The corporation was authorized \" to hold real and personal\
        \ estate to the amount of $150,000, exclusive of the books in its library,\
        \ and the collections of natural history and works of art in its museum.\"\
        \ And all its real and per sonal estate were to be held in trust \"for the\
        \ uses and pur poses appropriate for a public and social library and museum,\
        \ to be used and enjoyed by the inhabitants of Springfield, under such regulations\
        \ as the corporation might from time to time prescribe.\" The city of Springfield\
        \ was authorized to make appropriations for its maintenance so long as the\
        \ corporation allowed the inhabitants of the city free access to the library\
        \ at reasonable hours, for the purpose of using the same on the premises.\
        \ Entering the library proper by the spacious stairway, the visitor stands\
        \ in one of the most beautiful library interiors in this country. It occupies\
        \ the entire building above the first floor, extending therefrom to the oblong\
        \ dome. A clear space of <)G feet by 20 on the floor, and 50 feet in height,\
        \ is surrounded by alcoves 15 feet deep. A series of clusters of columns en\
        \ compass this open space, and from their carved, leafy capitals, each different\
        \ and all beautiful, spring arched ribs, which meet and intersect beneath\
        \ the glass dome. From these col umns radiate in every direction the alcoves\
        \ and galleries of the library. In the centre and front of the building, opposite\
        \ the stairway, occupying the room of two alcoves, is the dis tributing centre,\
        \ faced with a counter for the librarian and attendants. A winding iron staircase\
        \ connects this with tbe galleries, with the floor above, and with the tower.\
        \ Tin- centre alcoves at each end extend beyond the line of the building in\
        \ a bay-window, which gives additional appa rent length to the room and space\
        \ for a table and chairs. Each alcove has a height of 17 feet, with two divisions,\
        \ the upper accessible from a light gallery, from which in each corner alcove\
        \ a circular staircase leads to the floor below. The galleries form an unbroken\
        \ connection one with the other, and entirely surround the library. The new\
        \ organization was effected in May, 1864, and the fol lowing board of officers\
        \ were elected : John L. King, President ; D. L. Harris, Vice-President ;\
        \ Wm. Rice, Clerk and Librarian ; J. D. Safford, Treasurer ; George Bliss,\
        \ C. W. Chapin, J. M. Thompson, Chas. Merriam, Geo. Walker, E. W. Bond, J.\
        \ G. Holland, J. B. Stebbins, James Kirkham, and P. B. Tyler, Directors; O.\
        \ H. Greenleaf and Henry Smith, Auditors. The officers of the society at this\
        \ first meeting received a commu nication from Hon. Geo. Bliss offering to\
        \ donate a lot of land for a library building. A committee was at once appointed\
        \ to confer with architects and to obtain plans for a building. The president\
        \ of the association was also requested by the directors to secure subscriptions.\
        \ Many of the citizens re sponded liberally to this appeal, and in February,\
        \ 1865, the sum of $77,000 was raised, more than half this amount hav ing\
        \ been subscribed by the board of officers. Considerable delay was occasioned\
        \ by the difficulty of obtaining a plan for the building, but the one finally\
        \ accepted was by George Ha thorne, of New York. The building committee, in\
        \ October, 1867, contracted for the erection of the building with Ama ziah\
        \ Mayo. It was completed in the spring of 1871, at an A remarkable feature\
        \ of this library is the abundance of light, \u2014 a rare thing in such structures.\
        \ The dome is a large central skylight, some 50 feet in length, of ground\
        \ glass; this is covered above at a height of six or seven feet by a larger\
        \ frame-work containing an outer skylight. By this ar rangement tho heating\
        \ and ventilation are more thoroughly controlled in winter, the direct rays\
        \ of the sun tempered in summer, and at all times a softer and better light\
        \ secured. In addition to the centre light, the alcoves have also a mure direct\
        \ light, one or more windows being arranged in each alcove. A great defect\
        \ largely experienced in most existing libraries, namely, dark alcoves, has\

        \ the enterprise cost the town nearly $250,000, it has always been considered\
        \ a valuable investment, chiefly because it offers excellent facilities for\
        \ the prompt extinguishment of fires, and it was this motive which was the\
        \ primary cause of the creation of the works. The town was authorized by the\
        \ Legislature, in 1873, to construct water-works. They were begun the same\
        \ year, and completed in 1874. The storage reservoir, located in Montgomery,\

        \ 51 acres, and has a capacity of 184,000,000 gallons. Porter & Buell continued\

        \ interest, and Buell & Carter carried the publication forward to Febru ary,\

        \ 1824, by Maj. Joseph Root, was the first newspaper published in Westfield.\
        \ The paper was Federal in politics at the outset, but upon a change of proprietorship,\
        \ April, 1827, N. W. Smith and John B. Eldridge (the latter the original publisher\
        \ of the Hampden Whig, of Springfield) assuming control, Democratic tenden\
        \ cies soon began to appear in its columns, and its patronage fell away. Mr.\
        \ Smith withdrew the following September, and in November, 1828, Eldridge\
        \ relinquished the journal into the hands of its original proprietor, Maj.\
        \ Root. The latter lost no time, however, in disposing of his interest to\
        \ J. D. Hun tington, who, changing its name to the Westfield Register, and\
        \ its polities to Whig, conducted it until Nov. 29, 1831, when it was discontinued.\
        \ Besides the newspapers here mentioned may be noted The Westfield Standard,\
        \ a Democratic journal, which, first issued in 1845, was owned by a stock\
        \ company, and edited success ively until December, 1848, by Hiram A. Beebe,\
        \ J. D. Bates, and Wm. W. Whitman. At the last-mentioned date, James M. Ely\
        \ bought it, but sold it to Gilbert W. Cobb in 1852. Mr. Cobb edited it two\
        \ years, when it was discontinued. Shortly after his retirement from The News-Letter,\

        \ and on Sept. 10, 1833, the town having for two years been without a newspaper,\
        \ Joseph Bull issued the first number of the Westfield Journal. Until April,\
        \ 1835, it was neutral in politics, but at that time Norman T. Leonard, purchasing\
        \ it, changed the name to the Democratic Herald, and its politics were, of\

        \ first year of its existence, liberal support from members of both parties.\
        \ In October, 1841, Dr. William O. Bell bought the paper, and shortly afterward\
        \ changed its name to the Woronoco Palla- dium. He continued it under that\

        \ HISTORICAL SOCIETY.* The Connecticut Valley Historical Society was organized\
        \ by the adoption of by-laws and the choice of officers at a meeting held\
        \ at the City Library in Springfield on the 21st of April, 1876. A charter\
        \ was secured from the Secretary of the Commonwealth under Chapter 375 of\
        \ the Acts and Resolves of 1874, and the society thus became a corporation\
        \ legally es tablished under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachu setts,\
        \ May 9, 1876. The officers of the corporation elected at its organization\
        \ were the following: President, Judge Henry Morris ; Vice-Presidents, Judge\
        \ A. L. Soule, Hon. William L. Smith, and Samuel Bowles; Clerk and Treasurer,\
        \ Rev. Wm. Rice, D. D. ; Executive Committee, Rev. S. G. Buck ingham, D.D.,\
        \ Rev. E. A. Reed, Homer Merriam, Joseph C. Pynchon, Henry S. Lee, Charles\
        \ Marsh. In 1869 a donation of $6000 was made to the association by Miss Mary\
        \ Bryant, of Boston, with the condition that this amount be invested, and\
        \ the interest only be used for the pur chase of books. This was the first\
        \ donation made to the asso ciation looking toward an endowment. In 1878 a\
        \ donation of $1000 was also made to the permanent funds by Charles Mer riam,\
        \ on condition that the interest on the investment should be used under the\
        \ direction of the librarian, for the issue of free subscriptions to worthy\
        \ persons. Simultaneously with the opening of the library in the new building\
        \ a catalogue was published, prepared by the libra rian. The catalogue is\
        \ upon what is called the dictionary plan. The books are entered under the\
        \ name of the author and title, and they arc arranged also under subjects,\
        \ where the nature of the title will admit of it. To add to the value of the\
        \ catalogue for practical purposes, the scientific, philosophi cal, and theological\
        \ departments are thoroughly classified, and appropriate cross-references\
        \ are made. For the further con venience of the reader lists of authors and\
        \ titles of anony mous works are given, under poetry, fiction, and juveniles;\
        \ and lists of authors also, under religion and drama. The library was opened\
        \ in the new building with 31,400 volumes upon the shelves. Since that period\
        \ there has been an annual increase, and it now numbers (1878) 42,000 volumes.\
        \ The reasons which led to the organization of this society and the importance\
        \ of the objects which it contemplates are so ad mirably set forth in the\
        \ opening address of the president, Judge Henry Morris, that we cannot do\
        \ better than to present a considerable part of that address as a portion\
        \ of this brief history : \" The valley of the Connecticut presents a field\
        \ for historic research equaled by few, surpassed by none. True, we have no\
        \ Revolutionary battle-fields conse crated in the great struggle for independence.\
        \ The armies of England never penetrated so far into the interior. The only\
        \ British soldiers who came here came as prisoners, and some of these took\
        \ so kindly to our valley that they settled among us as citizens, married\
        \ wives, established homes, and raised fami lies. Some of their descendants\
        \ are with us at this day, filling positions of responsibility and usefulness.\
        \ In addition to the volumes belonging to the association, the library contains\
        \ a collection of the public documents of the United States, placed on deposit\
        \ for reference, by the trustees of the State Library. This collection now\
        \ numbers more than 2000 volumes, and is one of the most complete in the United\
        \ States. The library also contains the \" Reports of Drawings and Specifications,\"\
        \ published by the United States Patent-Office. The reading-room department\
        \ connected with the institution is well supplied with papers, magazines,\
        \ and reviews. \"But while we have in the valley no battle-grounds famous\
        \ in Revolutionary annals, we are rich in memorials of earlier trials. We\
        \ can point to many a spot where the war-whoop of the savage has echoed in\

        \ seven years accumulated a library of about 900 volumes. The first books,\
        \ 651 in number, were purchased in 1847 with funds contributed by the various\
        \ cor porations and by individuals. At a meeting held at \"Cabot Hall,\" April\
        \ 4, 1853, the inhabitants voted to accept a propo sition which had been made\
        \ by the institute to donate this collection to the town, with the condition\
        \ that the latter should for ten years appropriate annually the sum of $100\
        \ for new books, and pay the incidental expenses of the library. The books\
        \ were transferred to the town on the 14th of May follow ing. At the expiration\
        \ of the ten years the supervision of the library was duly vested in a committee\
        \ to be annually chosen by the selectmen. Upon the completion of the town-hall,\
        \ in 1871, the library was transferred to a room therein, set apart for the\
        \ purpose. The first librarian was J. R. Childs. The first catalogue was published\
        \ in 1846 ; additions in 1862 and 1866. During 1877-78 there were added 363\
        \ volumes, making a total of 4843. The new \" Encyclop\xE6dia Britannica\"\
        \ is among the late accessions, a gift from Hon. George Robinson. The library\
        \ possesses many other valuable works of refer ence, and, of course, a large\

        \ OF SPRINGFIELD.* The earliest library in Springfield of which any record\
        \ can be found is the collection of the Springfield Library Company, which\
        \ published a catalogue in 1796. It seems to have been a small library, to\
        \ which only the proprietors had access. The catalogue contained the regulations\
        \ of the library and a classified list of books. The regulations were as follows:\
        \ \" The hours in which the Librarian delivers books to the Proprietors are\
        \ from four to seven o'clock on the last Saturdays of the months of April,\
        \ Slay, June, July, August, and September, and from two to five o'clock on\
        \ the last Saturdays of the months of October, November, December, January,\
        \ February, and March. Each proprietor Is allowed by the by-laws of the company\
        \ to take out each day of delivery for each share he may own two folios or\
        \ three quartos, or one quarto and two octavos, or one quarto and four duodecimos,\
        \ or three octavos, or two octavos and three duodecimos, or one octavo and\
        \ four duodecimos, or six duode cimos.\" In 1859, Mayor W. B. Calhoun in his\
        \ inaugural refers to the association, and recommends that the city should\
        \ stand forth as the acknowledged patron of the library by an appro priation\
        \ for its support, and argues \" that, in view of the bene fits of a public\
        \ library as the fruitful source, not of the ordi nary and acknowledged blessings\
        \ of intelligence merely, but of an efficient and all-pervading economy, it\
        \ would be liter ally an institution of saving.'' But in view, probably, of\
        \ the continued heavy indebtedness of the city, and the necessity of large\
        \ appropriations for the current expenses, no action was had upon this recommendation.\
        \ The catalogue contains the titles of 320 volumes, classified under the following\
        \ divisions: divinity and ethics; history, biography, voyages, and travels;\
        \ poetry; novels; and mis cellaneous. What became of this library is unknown.\
        \ The second library organization of which any record remains was the Franklin\
        \ Library Association, which was composed of the workmen in the United States\
        \ Armory. The date of the establishment of this library is unknown. It existed\
        \ as a separate library until the year 1844, when it was made over to the\
        \ Young Men's Institute. During the year, however, the library of the association,\
        \ now numbering about 1500 volumes, with the consent and approbation of the\
        \ mayor and the committee on city property, was removed to the library-room\
        \ in the city hall. From the period of removal the city furnished rent, and\
        \ during most of the time fuel, lights, and the services of a janitor, free\
        \ of charge to the association. In January, 1824, the Hampden Mechanics' Association\
        \ was established. It founded a library called the Apprentices' Library. It\
        \ had for a time, also, a weekly evening school for apprentices and annual\
        \ courses of lectures. This association continued in existence until 1849,\
        \ but in 1845 its library was transferred to the Young Men's Institute. A\
        \ catalogue of the Apprentices' Library, published in 1834, gives 627 as the\
        \ number of books. Simultaneously with the occupancy of these rooms com menced\
        \ an earnest and persistent series of efforts to increase the resources and\
        \ extend the usefulness of the library. A subscription of about $8000 was\
        \ raised, and in the following year a fair was held by the ladies of the city\
        \ for the benefit of the association, the result of which was a gain to the\

        \ on the north bank of the Deerfield River, west of the centre of the town,\
        \ and on Rice and Mill Brooks. The village is surrounded by some of the most\
        \ pic turesque scenery in the county, which serves as a beautiful background,\
        \ and helps to make this a very attractive place. It is a station on the Troy\
        \ and Greenfield Railroad, about twenty miles from the latter place, and about\
        \ eight from Shel burne Falls. There are mills, stores, a tavern, a good school\
        \ house, Baptist, Methodist, and Congregational Churches, and about 400 inhabitants.\
        \ About 1845 an academy was built at the village of Charle mont by a stock\
        \ company, in which a select school was taught several years. The house was\
        \ a two-story frame, and base ment, and stood north of the Mayhew Block. For\
        \ a number of years it was unoccupied, and was frnally destroyed by fire.\
        \ The bell which formerly belonged to it is now in use on the public-school\
        \ building. Aaron Rice is credited with having sold the first goods in the\
        \ place, although not having a regular store. One of the first to engage in\
        \ trade on a larger scale was Samuel Rath bone, who, about 1800, opened a\
        \ store in the building now oc cupied by Nathan Ballard. The next store was\
        \ opened by Henry Sheldon, in the present tavern building. The third was on\
        \ the site of Dr. Dample's office, by George and Anthon Mayhew. Other stores\
        \ were soon opened at the stands now occupied by A. L. Tyler and Wells ; and\
        \ about 1852 the May hews built a large business house, which is now occupied\
        \ by Amos Avery. The place has had numerous merchants, and at present supports\
        \ five stores. CHARLEMONT LIBRARY was opened to the public in February, 1879,\
        \ with nearly 100 volumes. It is controlled by an association, legally organized\
        \ in December, 1878, and has for its first officers E. A. Field, President;\

        \ AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY. The movement which led to the formation of this society\
        \ originated at a cattle show held at Charlemont, Oct. 13, 1870, when the\
        \ following gentlemen were appointed to give effect to the purpose of founding\
        \ a society \" whose object shall be the attainment and diffusion of scientific\

        \ before the Revolution, Dr. Moses Heaton located in Charlemont as the physician\
        \ of the town. He was followed by Dr. Stephen Bates, who lived a mile east\
        \ of the village, and who was in practice until after 1820. He was succeeded\
        \ by his son, William K., and he in turn by his brother, Stephen, Jr., the\
        \ latter living at the village at the time of his death. Others in practice\
        \ have been Drs. George Winslow, Merritt F. Potter, David B. Hawks, Ashmun\
        \ H. Taylor, George M. Hanner, and James N. Fitch. At present Dr. H. Temple\
        \ is in practice here. This committee appointed agents in the above towns\
        \ to so licit life members for the above society, and it was resolved that\
        \ when 100 had been secured the organization should take place. A meeting\
        \ for this purpose was warned by Justice Tyler, Nov. 26, 1870, when a constitution\
        \ was adopted, and R. H. Leavitt, A. L. Tyler, and S. P. Everett were appointed\
        \ to secure a proper charter from the State. Having secured recognition from\
        \ the State authorities, the following were elected as the first board of\
        \ officers : President, R. H. Leavitt, of Charlemont ; Vice-Presidents, Willis\

        \ Oct. 10,1849, and resigned March 9, 1853. Then followed H. H. Harris, until\
        \ May 9, 1869; E. M. Doten, until Oct. 1, 1871, when F. B. Doten, the present\
        \ cashier, took charge. Present directors, Timothy W. Carter, Edwin O. Carter,\

        \ Wells. This bank has now (1878) a surplus of \xA775,000, the capital remaining\
        \ unchanged. In 1845, Charles W. McClallan and R. E. Bemis constructed the\
        \ first works for supplying water through pipes to the vil lage of Chicopee,\
        \ \u2014 then Cabotville. For this purpose water was taken from springs and\
        \ wells at the higher elevation just south of the village. These works answered\
        \ a temporary purpose, and in 1874, after the death of Mr. Bemis, became by\
        \ purchase wholly the property of Mr. McClallan. In 1876 arrangements were\
        \ made for a more satisfactory supply from certain spring-fed brooks, beyond\
        \ the east line of Chicopee, in Springfield, and there a dam was accordingly\
        \ erected. The following year a company was incorporated with a capital limited\
        \ to \xA775,000. The interests of Mr. McClallan were pur chased by this company,\
        \ he remaining a stockholder. The incorporators were Charles McClallan, Emerson\
        \ Gaylord, George A. Denison, C. H. Hyde, Erastus Stebbins, and Wil liam C.\
        \ McClallan. The company was organized as the \"Chicopee Water Company,\"\
        \ April 18, 1877, with \xA750,000 capital. The mains have been extended, and\
        \ are chiefly of iron, cement-lined, though some are of iron only. The sup\
        \ ply of water is large, and is furnished to the corporations and private\
        \ dwellings, and also to the fire district. The works have about eighty feet\
        \ head. Officers : Charles McClallan, President; William C. McClallan, Treasurer.\
        \ THE CHICOPEE SAVINGS-BANK was organized in 1854. Jerome Wells was the first\
        \ presi dent, and continued until 1874, when George D. Robinson assumed the\
        \ position, and remained until 1878. He was suc ceeded by Emerson Gaylord,\
        \ the present president. Henry H. Harris, the present treasurer, has held\
        \ that office from the date of organization. RAILROADS. The Connecticut River\
        \ Railroad has a station at Chicopee Junction, from which point a branch road\
        \ leads up the south side of the Chicopee River to Chicopee Falls. The main\
        \ line was opened for travel Dec. 13, 1845, \u2014 the branch in August, 1846.\
        \ The former passes just west of the village of Chicopee (centre), crossing\
        \ the river of that name near its mouth, and the Connecticut at the village\

        \ The first bridge across the Chicopee River, at Chicopee, was built in or\
        \ about the year 1778, and crossed near where the present bridge stands. Its\
        \ piers were of plank and filled with stone. This bridge was in part paid\
        \ for by a lottery sanctioned by law. THE CHICOPEE FALLS SAVINGS-BANK was\

        \ bridge crossing the Connecticut at Chicopee Junction was erected as a toll-bridge\
        \ by the Chicopee and West Spring field Bridge Company, in 1848-49. It was\
        \ some time since made free to the public, and is now maintained b}- the town.\

        \ Belcher, son of Benjamin, has lived nearly all his days at Chicopee Falls,\
        \ where his father so early settled. The region was almost an unbroken wilderness,\
        \ with only an occasional dwelling, and those not within neighborly distance\
        \ of one another, when his father made the purchase from Ste phen Wright and\
        \ Levi Hitchcock, who then owned nearly all the land at that place. So undisturbed\
        \ had been the order of nature in the solemn aisles of the wildwood that the\
        \ shy wild turkey, in considerable numbers, frequented their deeper recesses,\
        \ and the gamy salmon abounded in the river. GAS-WORKS. In 1849 the subject\
        \ of lighting the mills was introduced, and resulted in the organization of\
        \ a gas company at Chico pee Centre, in which the four large manufacturing\
        \ companies \u2014 Ames, Cabot, Perkins, and Dwight\u2014 united. Gas-works\
        \ were erected in 1850, with a capacity sufficient to supply the mills and\
        \ meet the ordinary wants of the village, and in cluded a retort-house for\
        \ fifteen retorts, a purifying-house, and a gas-holder 60 feet in diameter\
        \ and 20 feet in height. \" Main\" to the amount of 4000 feet was laid, and\
        \ gas intro duced in the mills early in May the same year. Since then the\
        \ pipes have been extended through the principal streets and the village supplied\
        \ with gas. In early deeds the place was called Skenungonuck, and in modern\
        \ days has often been confounded with Skipmuck, which is one and a half miles\
        \ farther east. Mr. Belcher says that his father moved into the house that\
        \ Wright had occupied, and there lived from 1802 until 1S15.", 1]

        \ of Chicopee, a soldier of the Revolution, died on the 8th day of August,\
        \ 1800, at the age of ninety-eight year? and ten months. He was huried with\
        \ military honors, at Chicopee Falls, a detachment of the Springfield City\
        \ Guards, under the command of Lieut. G. A. Fuller, acting as escort and guard\
        \ of honor on the occasion. Torrent Engine Com pany of that village, with\

        \ to garrison duty at Fort Ticonderoga, then containing 3000 troops, and was\
        \ present at the time of Burgoyne's attack, July 5th of that year. After the\
        \ retreat to Whitehall and Southern Ver mont, his term of enlistment having\

        \ locality un surpassed in the quiet beauty of the landscape it presents,\
        \ \u2014 \"not excepting the Bay of Naples,\" says a distinguished traveler.\
        \ At the Mill village R. N. Porter produced $35,000 manu facturing lumber,\
        \ grain, and husks, and W. W. Porter about $5000 in grain. Robert Childs,\

        \ & Phelps $7000 worth was turned out. Wm. P. Allen made shingles to the amount\
        \ of $3000. The scene of the Bars fight is a point of historic interest, and,\
        \ near by, the romantic Stillwater, where the wearied Po comptuck sleeps in\
        \ a cradle which it has quarried hundreds of feet deep from the solid rock.\
        \ The grand old trees which sentinel the Old Street and shade its quiet walks\
        \ are rarely excelled, while the Champney elm, queen of them all in size,\
        \ grace, and majestic beauty, has scarce its fellow in all New England. The\
        \ John Russell Cutlery Works, the pioneer in America, established about forty\
        \ years ago, had, in 1869, a capital of $520,000. It produced in that year\
        \ knives to the value of $721,000, employing 500 men and consuming $85,000\
        \ worth of stock.* LIBRARIES. Before the close of the last century there was\
        \ an agricul tural library here, and another devoted to military science.\
        \ Soon after, there appears a \" Union Library,\" which, perhaps, absorbed\
        \ the others. The Union was finally dissolved and scattered, and upon its\
        \ ruins was founded the \" Social Li brary,\" which contained about 4000 volumes\
        \ in 1830. This being broken and getting behind the times, a more radical\
        \ club was started in 1840. This now exists as the \" Deerfield Reading Association,\"\
        \ with about 2000 volumes. Its main features have been periodical literature\
        \ and history. It has met every Thursday night since its organization. Its\
        \ librarians have been Charles Williams, E. H. Ames, Geo. Sheldon, C. M. Crittenden,\
        \ Alanson Thayer, C. S. Williams, James C. Hitchcock, Nathaniel Hitchcock,\
        \ Eliza D. Williams, and Martha G. Pratt, who is now serving her eighteenth\
        \ year. Before the advent of railroads, Cheapside, being at tbe head of \"\
        \ fall boat\" navigation on the Pocomptuck, was a place of considerable trade.\
        \ Goods were hauled by teams from hereto Greenfield and tbe towns to the north\
        \ and west. A cooper shop, an establishment for barreling beef, and a cabinet-shop\
        \ were located here, and other industries. OBJECTS OF INTEREST. The Pocomptuck\
        \ Valley Memorial Association, with head quarters at Deerfield, was incorporated\
        \ by an act of the Legis lature in 1870. The then \" Trustees of the Old Indian\
        \ House Door\" \u2014 George Sheldon, Robert Crawford, Nathaniel Hitch cock,\
        \ Luke Wright, and Samuel F. Wells \u2014 were named as cor porators. The\
        \ meeting for organization was held May 26, 1870. The officers chosen were\
        \ George Sheldon, President ; Josiah D. Canning, of Gill, and James M. Crafts,\
        \ of Whately, Vice-Presidents ; Recording Secretary and Treasurer, Na thaniel\
        \ Hitchcock ; Corresponding Secretary, Rev. Robert Crawford, D.D. ; Councillors,\

        \ of Mon tague ; Moses Stebbins, of Bloody Brook ; Rev. Edgar Buck ingham,\
        \ L. W. Rice, of Greenfield. The date of the annual meeting was fixed for\
        \ the last Tuesday in February. The president, secretaries, and treasurer\
        \ have been annually re elected. The objects of the association are collecting\
        \ and pre serving memorials, books, papers, ancient furniture, relics, implements,\
        \ etc., which may tend to illustrate tbe history of bygone generations, both\
        \ Indian and English. A juvenile library was founded some sixty years ago,\
        \ which was probably the foundation of the first Congregational Sun day-school\
        \ library. A library was established at Bloody- Brook a few years ago, which\

        \ Salah Barnard, son of Ebenezer, was born in 1725, and was a soldier, merchant,\
        \ tavern-keeper, and farmer. He mar ried, in 1765, Elizabeth, daughter of\
        \ Jeremiah Nims. He was in the old French war, and served under Capts. Thomas\
        \ Ste vens, John Hawks, and other partisan officers. He was in the Canada\
        \ expeditions in the last French war, in 1757, as lieu tenant in Capt. Burk's\
        \ Rangers; in 1758, as lieutenant under Capt. John Catlin, and on the death\
        \ of the latter he was made captain. With this company he served in Col. Ruggles'\
        \ regi ment, and was with tbe army of conquest in Canada with the commission\
        \ of a major. At the fall of Fort William Henry he narrowly escaped the perfidious\
        \ butchery that followed the surrender. He lived on the old Frary lot, and\
        \ ahout a century ago he enlarged his house to its present dimensions and\
        \ set up tavern- and store-keeping. He died in 1795. The association has had\
        \ 130 members, scattered through the Northern States. It now owns the Deerfield\
        \ Academy build ing, which will soon be fitted up to receive the collections,\
        \ and be the Memorial Hall. No stranger comes to Deerfield but has heard of\
        \ the tragic events of Feb. 29, 1704, and has a curiosity to see the \" Old\
        \ Indian House Door,\" with its rough carvings by Indian hatchets. This relic\
        \ \u2014 \" old, and brave, and scarred\" \u2014 is now in the hands of the\
        \ Pocomptuck Valley Memorial Association, and will soon be placed in Memorial\
        \ Hall. Maj. Seth Catlin, son of Capt. John Catlin, was horn in 1743. He married,\
        \ July 1, 1762, Abigail Denio. In the last French war he was a drummer in\
        \ his father's company, \u2014 in 1757-58. On the death of the latter he was\
        \ appointed second lieutenant, and served under Amherst in the campaign of\
        \ 1759. He was a lieutenant in the army of conquest, and came home with the\
        \ title of quartermaster in Col. Ruggles' regi ment. Maj. Catlin was a notable\
        \ man in many respects. A contemporary says of him, \" He was a man of strict\
        \ integrity, of very strong feelings, \u2014 could never pass a scene of distress\
        \ on the other side.\" These traits are proved by many anec dotes. Another\
        \ wrote, \" From sincere and honest motives he was opposed to tbe war of the\
        \ Revolution, but be often re fused important offices in that war from the\
        \ British govern ment, as also from his own country.\" He was a gentleman\
        \ from intuition, and his society was sought by men of all sta tions. He was\
        \ selectman nine years, and a representative in Around the spot occupied by\

        \ as an obstetrician, and probably had a larger practice in that line than\
        \ almost any other physician in the Connecticut Valley. He had a great reputation\
        \ in the treat ment of women and children, and was a man of most urbane and\

        \ in Berkshire County in 1797, educated at Williams College, and studied medicine\
        \ at Boston. He was an excellent physician, and for many years one of the\
        \ prominent men of the town. Drs. Wheeler, Reed, Sheldon, and Barber were\
        \ also in practice a short time, but did not remain long enough to become\
        \ identified with the town. About 1808, Selah Munson built a fulling-mill\
        \ at the village, but soon after sold his interests to Ebenezer Nims. After\
        \ 1812, Erastus and Moses Gleason enlarged the business, and added sixty spindles\
        \ for the manufacture of satinets. The machin ery for carding was then removed\
        \ and the clothing-works car ried on by Solomon Amidon and Moses Gleason,\
        \ who changed the location of the factory to a point farther up the stream,\
        \ where it was successfully operated. EDUCATIONAL. It is generally believed\
        \ that Rev. Cornelius Jones taught the first school in Rowe, in a small cabin\
        \ near the centre, some time before the Revolution. Sept. 14, 1785, the town\
        \ voted to have three school divisions, to be formed by Jonas Gleason, Benjamin\
        \ Brown, and William Taylor. The report of this committee, made the following\
        \ year, denominated the districts as the north, the east, and the west divis\
        \ ions. In the two last named school-houses were built soon after, and, in\
        \ 1789, three months' school were taught in each of them at the expense of\
        \ the town. The school-house in the east district was of stone, and stood\
        \ near the old Wells place. In 1836, Solomon Amidon and Joseph Burton erected\
        \ the present factory building, \u2014 a large three-story frame structure,\
        \ \u2014 and supplied it with good machinery for the manufacture of satinets.\
        \ This business was afterward carried on by a stock company, which was discontinued\
        \ before 1848. Subse quently the factory has been partially operated by S.\
        \ P. Day. Wooden-ware has been manufactured here, and it is said that an invoice\
        \ of howls was sent to California for use in the placer-washings when gold\
        \ was first discovered. Cut nails have also been made by Erastus Gleason.\
        \ Other small in dustries flourished for a short time between 1825 and 1850.\
        \ The town is yet well supplied with the ordinary mechanic shops. In 1790\
        \ the town voted to pay Isaac Langdon 13s. for board ing the schoolmaster\
        \ and his horse two weeks, and made an appropriation of \xA330 for schooling.\
        \ Seven years later three school-houses were ordered to be built, and the\
        \ following year it was \"Voted that the tax laid on dogs the present year\
        \ be appropriated to the support of schools, each division to be en titled\
        \ to the money that it pays for said animals.\" HAMLETS. The pioneers of Rowe\
        \ endeavored to locate the business of the town at or near the geographical\
        \ centre. There the first stores and taverns were kept until more important\
        \ industries attracted them to points better adapted for business centres.\
        \ The geographical centre of the town is north of the present village. There\
        \ the first church was erected, and there is now located the Unitarian Church,\
        \ around which are clustered half a dozen buildings. The place was formerly\
        \ much larger than at present, and was locally known as In 1878 the town had\
        \ seven school districts, in each of which two terms of school were maintained\
        \ per year, at a cost of about $1000. The total number of scholars enrolled\
        \ was 226, and the supervising committee was composed of V. M. Porter, L.\
        \ E. Henry, and J. A. Stanford. MIDDLE ROWE. ROWE SOCIAL LIBRARY Here, before\
        \ 1790, was opened the first store in town, by a man named Ransom. The business\
        \ was continued by William Langdon. Afterward the Tutties put up a large building\
        \ for mercantile purposes, a part of which yet remains, and forms the public-hall.\

        \ P. Smith, Capt. Willam Taylor, and Dr. Pardon Haj'nes, Judges. Ambrose Potter\
        \ had the first public-house in town, near where Dr. Gould afterward lived,\
        \ as early as 1780. At the centre, Ezra Tuttle kept an inn, and was followed\
        \ by Thomas Riddle. On the road east, the Langdons and others kept taverns.\
        \ In 1806 the library contained 130 volumes, chiefly works on history, travels,\
        \ philosophy, and theology. It was success fully continued by the association\
        \ until March, 1869, when the town assumed charge, agreeing to pay $25 annually\

        \ the centre, on Pelham Brook, and contains a Baptist Church, a good school-house,\
        \ a store, factory, tannery, and mills. The population is about 125. A store\
        \ was opened here about 1845, by Cyrus Ballou, in a building which has been\
        \ occupied since 1853 by E. E. Amidon, at present one of the oldest merchants\

        \ man agement of H. E. Nelson. RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES. The post-office was established\
        \ at the centre, and remained there until 1874, since which it has been kept\

        \ from Zoar, in Charlemont. At the Hoosac Tunnel a post-office has lately\
        \ been established in connection with a hotel. The first religious society\
        \ dates from the settlement of the Rev. Cornelius Jones, in 1770. He and his\
        \ family composed the first members of the Church of Christ in Myrifield,\
        \ which was formally organized about 1774 with a few additional members, viz.\
        \ : Deacon Archibald Thomas and his wife, Elizabeth ; Deacon Jonas Gleason\
        \ and his wife, Lucy ; and one or two others. In the fall of 1776 the church-roll\

        \ the settlement of the valley. It is a short distance south of the old church.\
        \ The Cabot House was built in 1834-35 by Chester W. Chapin. The land \u2014\
        \ about three-quarters of an acre \u2014 was purchased by him from the Springfield\
        \ Canal Company, Oct. 30, 1833, and the deed of that date recites that \"\
        \ no building or part of a building thereon shall ever be occupied or used\
        \ for the sale of spirituous liquors, except as a public tavern house.\" The\
        \ first landlord was Gardner Kimball, who was succeeded by Marvin and Ethan\
        \ Chapin, and they, from 1849 to April, 1804, by Madison Kendall. William\
        \ H. Dickinson then be came proprietor and landlord, and continues cheerily\
        \ to serve the friend and the stranger. CHICOPEE. The Catholic Cemetery is\
        \ in the southern portion of the town, was a gift from the Springfield Canal\
        \ Company, and was opened in 1836. Maple Grove Cemetery is situated in the\
        \ eastern portion of the village of Chicopee, and now contains about two acres.\
        \ It was originally much smaller and used as a common burial place. The additions\
        \ to this cemetery were made by private parties, who laid out and sold the\
        \ lots therein; but the whole was afterward placed under the control of an\
        \ organization repre sented by a president, clerk, and board of trustees.\
        \ The first burial in this ground was in 1836. President, Silas Mosman ; Cleik,\
        \ R. E. Robertson. Wilde's Hotel, corner of Front and Church Streets, Chico\
        \ pee Falls, was built in 1834, by Elihu Adams, who for a long time was its\
        \ landlord. Since his time the following have catered to the public within\
        \ its hospitable walls : Messrs. Newell, Dodge, Perry, Chapin, Rounds, and\
        \ Anson F. Weldes, the present proprietor. The new cemetery, opened by the\
        \ town in 1869, contains about 25 acres, and is situated in the southern portion\
        \ of the town, near the Springfield line. The land was purchased -in four\
        \ parcels from Robert E. Bemis, the estate of Ruel Van Horn, George W. Paine,\
        \ and Michael Conway. The first burial in this ground was that of Lydia A.\
        \ Hyde, wife of Chauncey H., who died March 13, 1870. A house was opened by\
        \ Monroe Chapin at the corner of Perkins and Exchange Streets, about the year\
        \ 1840-45, and named the Perkins Street Lunch. This became, in process of\
        \ time, the Eagle Hotel, and as such was first kept by Monroe Chapin, of lucifer-mateh\
        \ fame, and subsequently by Rufus Mosher and Horace Adams. Lafayette Temple,\
        \ Henry S. Herrick, and Jonathan R. Whittemore are the present cemetery committee.\
        \ A public-house was constructed of an old farm-dwelling, at the corner of\
        \ Centre and West Streets, in 1840, and named the Connecticut River House.\
        \ William Miller was the first landlord. It was afterward kept by Charles\
        \ W. Mead and others. Fire finished its career about tho year 1845, and few\
        \ were they who wept above its ashes. CHICOPEE FALLS. The cemetery at Chicopee\
        \ Falls stretches from East Street to the Springfield road, and contains somewhat\
        \ less than three acres. It originated in a lease of one acre made by Ben\
        \ jamin Belcher to the Chicopee Manufacturing Company for nine hundred and\
        \ ninety-nine years. The same was to be used by the inhabitants of School\
        \ District No. 16 for burial purposes. A condition required that a fence be\
        \ built and maintained around the property. Additions, afterward made, extended\
        \ the grounds to East Street. Committee in charge, T. B. Wattles, William\

        \ In 1849 a farm was purchased and an almshouse erected, by which the first\
        \ indebtedness was created, amounting to $5001. 72. The farm was sold in 1860.\
        \ In 1877, $15,000 were appropriated by the town for the pur chase of land\

        \ of St. Benet, Paul's Wharf, towards the upper end of the aisle. He was about\
        \ seventy two years old. Amongst his works is a preface to Izaak Walton's\
        \ 'Angler.'\" squandered away his small patrimony, when he became first an\
        \ attendant in Lord Oxford's library j and afterwards librarian. He was a\
        \ little mean- 1 looking man, of a vulgar address, and, when I knew him, rarely\
        \ sober in the afternoon, never after supper. His favourite liquor was porter,\
        \ with a glass of gin between each pot. Dr. Ducarrel told me he used to stint\
        \ Oldys to three pots of beer whenever he visited him. Oldys seemed to have\
        \ little classical learning, and knew nothing of the sciences ; but for index-reading,\
        \ title-pages, and the knowledge of scarce English books and editions, he\
        \ had no equal. This he had probably picked up in Lord Oxford's service, after\
        \ whose death he was obliged to write for the booksellers for a subsistence.\
        \ Amongst many other publications, chiefly in the biographical line, he wrote\
        \ the ' Life of Sir Walter Raleigh,' which got him much repu- tation. The\
        \ Duke of Norfolk, in particular, was so pleased with it that he resolved\
        \ to provide for him, and accordingly gave him the patent of Norroy King at\
        \ Arms, then vacant. The patronage of that duke occasioned a suspicion of\
        \ his being a Papist, though I really think without reason ; this for a while\
        \ retarded his appointment. It was underhand propagated by the heralds, who\
        \ were vexed at having a stranger put in upon them. He was a man of great\
        \ good-nature, honour, and integrity, particularly in his character as an\
        \ his- torian. Nothing, I firmly believe, would ever have biassed him to insert\
        \ any fact in his writings he did not believe, or to suppress any he did.\
        \ Of this delicacy he gave an instance at a time when he was in great distress.\
        \ After the publication of his ' Life of Sir Walter Raleigh,' some booksellers,\
        \ thinking his name would sell a piece they were publishing, offered him a\
        \ considerable sum to father it, which he refused with the greatest indig-\
        \ nation. He was much addicted to low company ; j most of his evenings he\
        \ spent at the ' Bell ' in the Old Bailey, a house within the liberties of\
        \ the Fleet, j frequented by persons whom he jocularly called rulers, from\
        \ their being confined to the rules or limits of that prison. From this house\
        \ a watchman, whom he kept regularly in pay, used to lead him home before\
        \ twelve o'clock, in order to save sixpence paid to the porter of the Heralds'\
        \ office, by all those j who came home after that time ; sometimes, and not\
        \ unfrequently, two were necessary. He could not resist the temptation of\
        \ liquor, even when he was to officiate on solemn occasions ; for at the burial\
        \ of the Princess Caroline he was so intoxicated that he could scarcely walk,\
        \ but reeled about with a crown j coronet' on a cushion, to the great scandal\
        \ of his brethren. His method of composing was somewhat The following pretty\
        \ anacreontic, on a fly drink ing out of his cup of ale, which is doubtless\
        \ well known, is from the pen of Oldys : \u2014 \"Busy, curious, thirsty fly,\

        \ and sip it up. Make the most of life you may ; Life is short, and wears\

        \ ; Thine's a summer, mine no more, Though repeated to threescore ; Threescore\
        \ summers, when they're gone, Will appear as short as one.\" The Rev. Mark\
        \ Noble comments upon Grose's text by saying that this story of the crown\
        \ must be incorrect, as the coronet at the funeral of a princess is always\
        \ carried by Clarencieux, and not by Norroy. In 1794, two eminent heralds,\
        \ Benjamin Pingo, York Herald, and John Charles Brooke, Somerset Herald, were\

        \ The total frontage of the new buildings to this street is 150 feet, and\
        \ the depth upwards of 100 feet. The structure consists mainly of two rooms,\
        \ or halls, placed one over the other, with reading, committee, and muniment\
        \ rooms surrounding them. Of these two halls the museum occupies the lower\
        \ site, the floor being level with the ancient crypt of the Guildhall, with\
        \ which it will directly communicate, and is consequently somewhat below the\
        \ present level of Basinghall Street. This room, divided into naves and aisles,\
        \ is 83 feet long and 64 feet wide, and has a clear height of 26 feet. The\
        \ large fire proof muniment rooms on this floor, entered from the museum,\
        \ are intended to hold the valuable archives of the City. Within an elevated\
        \ niche of dark-coloured marble, at the upper end of the room, is a fine statue,\
        \ in white marble, by Chantrey, of George III., which was executed at the\

        \ but in very varying and \u2014 in comparison with the size and im portance\
        \ of the wards \u2014 inconsequential numbers. Bassishaw and Lime Street Wards\

        \ could use books more roughly. He had no affectation about books, nor, indeed,\

        \ a grosser exhi bition than this man's intoxication.\" The library of the\
        \ institution appears, however, to have derived little advantage from Porson's\
        \ supervision of it, beyond the few criticisms which were found in his handwriting\
        \ in some of the volumes. Owing to his very irregular habits, the great scholar\
        \ proved but an inefficient librarian; he was irregular in attendance, and\
        \ was fre quently brought home at midnight drunk. The directors had determined\
        \ to dismiss him, and said they only knew him as their librarian from seeing\
        \ his name attached to receipts of salary. Indeed, he was already breaking\
        \ up, and his stupendous memory had begun to fail. On the 19th of September,\
        \ 1806, he left the Old Jewry to call on his brother-in-law, Perry, in the\
        \ Strand, and at the comer of Northumberland Street was struck down by a fit\
        \ of apoplexy. He was carried over to the St. Martin's Lane workhouse, and\
        \ there slowly recovered consciousness. Mr. Savage, the under-librarian, seeing\
        \ an advertisement in the British Press, describing a person picked up, having\
        \ Greek memoranda in his pocket, went to the workhouse and brought Porson\
        \ home in a hackney coach ; he talked about the fire which the night before\
        \ had destroyed Covent Garden Theatre, and as they rounded St. Paul's, remarked\
        \ upon the ill treatment Wren had received. On reaching the Old Jewry, and\
        \ after he had breakfasted, Dr. Adam Clarke called and had a conversation\
        \ with Porson about a stone with a Greek inscription, brought from Ephesus\
        \ ; he also discussed a Mosaic pavement recently found in Palestrina, and\
        \ quoted two lines from the Greek Anthologia. Dr. Adam Clarke particularly\
        \ noticed that he gave the Greek rapidly, but the English with painful slowness,\
        \ as if the Greek came more naturally. Then, apparently fancying himself under\
        \ restraint, he walked out, and went into the African or Cole's coffee-house\
        \ in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill; there he would have fallen had he not\
        \ caught hold of one of the brass rods of the boxes. Some wine and some jelly\
        \ dissolved in brandy and water considerably roused him, but he could hardly\
        \ speak, and the waiter took him back to the Institution in a coach. He expired\
        \ exactly as the clock struck twelve, on the night of Sunday, September 25,\
        \ 1808. He was buried in the Chapel of Trinity College, Cam bridge, and eulogies\
        \ of his talent, written in Greek and Latin verse, were affixed to his pall\u2014\

        \ nicety and regularity,\" says his bio grapher, \"that the eye of the reader,\
        \ unless upon the closest examination, takes them for print.\" Lord Byron\
        \ remembered Porson at Cambridge ; in the hall where he himself dined, at\
        \ the Vice- Chancellor's table, and Porson at the Dean's, he always appeared\
        \ sober in his demeanour, nor was he guilty, as far as his lordship knew,\
        \ of any excess or outrage in public ; but in an evening, with a party of\
        \ undergraduates, he would, in fits of intoxication, get into violent disputes\
        \ with the young men, and arrogantly revile them for not knowing what he thought\
        \ they might be expected to know. He once went away in disgust, because none\

        \ the London mob accused the Jews of aiding the king, and plundered their\
        \ houses : all the Israelites would have perished, had they not taken refuge\
        \ in the Tower. By royal edict the Christians were forbidden to buy flesh\
        \ of a Jew, and no Jew was allowed to employ Christian nurses, bakers, brewers,\
        \ or cooks. Towards the close of Henry's life the synagogue in Old Jewry was\
        \ again taken from the Jews, and given to the Friars Penitent, whose chapel\
        \ stood hard by, and who complained of the noise of the Jewish congregation\
        \ ; but the king permitted another synagogue to be built in a more suitable\
        \ place. Henry then ordered the Jews to pay up all arrears of tallages within\
        \ four months, and half of the sum in seventeen days. The Tower of London\
        \ was naturally soon full of grey-bearded Jewish debtors. \" Whole rolls full\
        \ of patents relative to Jewish estates,\" says Mr. Margoliouth, \"are still\
        \ to be seen at the Tower, which estates, together with their rent in fee,\
        \ permissions, and mortgages, were all seized by the king.\" \u25A0 Old Jewry,\
        \ and Jewin Street, Aldersgate, where their burial-ground was, still preserve\
        \ a dim memory of their residence among us. There used to be a tradition in\
        \ England that the Jews buried much of their treasure here, in hopes of a\
        \ speedy return to the land, where they had suffered so much, yet where they\
        \ had thriven. In spite of the edict of banishment a few converted Jews continued\
        \ to reside in England, and after the Reformation some unconverted Jews ventured\
        \ to return. Rodrigo Lopez, a physician of Queen Elizabeth's, for instance,\
        \ was a Jew. He was tortured to death for being accused of designing to poison\
        \ the Queen. No wonder, with all these persecutions, that the Chancery Lane\
        \ house of converts began soon to sill. \"On one of the rolls of this reign,\"\
        \ says Mr. Margoliouth, probably quoting Prynne's famous diatribe against\
        \ the Jews, \" about 500 names of Jewish converts are registered.\" From the\
        \ 50th year of Henry III. to the 2nd of Edward I., the Crown, says Coke, extorted\

        \ Sheriff of London, at his own house, where we had a great feast; it is built,\

        \ and the diffusion of useful knowledge.\" This institution was temporarily\
        \ located in Sir Robert Clayton's famous old house. Upon the first committee\
        \ of the institution were Mr. R. Angerstein and Mr. Richard Sharp. Porson,\
        \ the famous Greek scholar and editor of Euripides, was thought an eligible\
        \ man to be its principal librarian. He was accordingly appointed to the Edward\

        \ yellow taffety, as a distinguishing mark of their nationality, and demanded\
        \ from each of them threepence every Easter. Then began the plunder. The king\
        \ wanted money to build Car narvon and Conway castles, to be held as fortresses\
        \ against the Welsh, whom he had just recently con quered and treated with\
        \ great cruelty, and the Jews were robbed accordingly. It was not difficult\
        \ in those days to find an excuse for extortion if the royal exchequer was\
        \ empty. In the 7 th year of Edward no less than 294 Jews were put to death\
        \ for clipping money, and all they possessed seized by the king. In his 17\
        \ th year all the Jews in England were imprisoned in one night, as Selden\
        \ proves by an old Hebrew inscription found at Winchester, and not released\
        \ till they had paid ,\xA320,000 of silver for a ransom. At last, in the year\
        \ 1290, came the Jews' final expulsion from England, when 15,000 or 16,000\

        \ of laughter, and of anger, and of pain. There was a dreadful con fusion\
        \ of sounds, and as I listened, with wonder and affright, he said, ' This\
        \ is my organ of hearing ; this great bell is in communication with all other\
        \ bells within the circle of hieroglyphics, by which every word spoken by\

        ). Smith and Barham both died in 1845. Of Sydney Smith's connection with St.\

        \ Grey said on entering Downing Street, to a relation who was with him, was,\
        \ \" Now I shall be able to do something for Sydney Smith,\" and shortly after\
        \ he was appointed by the Premier to a prebendal stall at St. Paul's, in exchange\
        \ for the one he held at Bristol. Mr. Cockerell, the architect, and superintendent\
        \ of St. Paul's Cathedral, in a letter printed in Lady Holland's \" Memoir,\"\
        \ describes the gesta of the canon residentiary ; how his early communications\

        \ unpleasant ; but when the canon had investigated the matter, and there had\
        \ been \" a little collision,\" nothing could be more candid and kind than\
        \ his subsequent treatment He examined the prices of all the materials used\
        \ in the repairs of the cathedral \u2014 as Portland stone, putty, and white\
        \ lead ; every item was taxed, pay ments were examined, and nothing new could\
        \ be undertaken without his survey and personal super intendence. He surveyed\
        \ the pinnacles and heights of the sacred edifice ; and once, when it was\
        \ feared he might stick fas. in a narrow opening of the western towers, he\
        \ declared that \" if there were six inches of space there would be room enough\

        \ us, engaged his early attention; St. Paul's was speedily and effectually\
        \ insured in some of the most substantial offices in London. Not satisfied\
        \ with this security, he advised the introduction of the mains of the New\
        \ River into the lower parts of the fabric, and cisterns and movable engines\
        \ in the roof; and quite justifiable was his joke, that \" he would re produce\
        \ the Deluge in our cathedral.\" It is probable that this gentleman had actually\
        \ ascended to the top of St. Paul's, and that impres sions there received,\
        \ being afterwards renewed in his mind when in a state of vivid excitement,\
        \ in a dream of ecstatic reverie, became so blended with the creations of\
        \ fancy as to form one mysterious vision, in which the true and the imaginary\
        \ were afterwards inseparable. Such, at least, is the best explanation of\
        \ the phenomena which occurs to us. In 1855 the fees for seeing St. Paul's\
        \ completely were 4s. 4d. each person. In 1847 the mere two pences paid to\
        \ see the forty monuments produced the four vergers the sum of \xA3430 3s.\

        \ by Jennings, the carpenter, in 1707, as a fund for the injured during the\
        \ building of the cathedral. He had also the library heated by a stove, so\

        \ The other Abbots were' subject to the diocesan in spiritual affairs and\

        \ in his absence. He lived \"in considerable state and pomp\" in his apartments\
        \ in the Monastery. Besides a common Prior there were also Lord- Priors, who\
        \ had special jurisdic tions, and were Lords of Parliament. In Dunfermline\
        \ Abbey there .was at least one Prior before the Abbots were introduced (see\
        \ An. Duns, dates 1 104- 1 120); and although they are not always specially\
        \ mentioned in the Register of the Abbey, still every Abbot would have his\
        \ Prior; and thus there would be at least 37 Priors of Dunfermline between\
        \ A.D. 1 100 and 1560. 3. Sub-Prior. \u2014 This functionary was the Prior's\
        \ assistant, and sometimes acted as his substitute. His special duties appear\
        \ to have been to take notice of any of the conventual brethren who neglected\
        \ their duties, or were absent without leave. He took care that the doors\
        \ were kept locked from five o'clock in the evening till five o'clock in the\

        \ or Steward, was the Abbot's deputy, in his character of temporal lord of\
        \ the Abbey property. This office was usually held by a layman of distinction\
        \ in the locality. Latterly, the office became in a great measure hereditary\
        \ in families. 5. The Sacrist, Sacristan, or Secretarius, took charge of the\
        \ vessels and orna ments of the altar and church, and of the robes, chalices,\
        \ candles, sacramental elements, &c. 6. The Precentor or Chanter led the service\

        \ missals, breviaries, festival robes, all the records, and frequently the\

        \ History of Ireland to the Thirteenth Century, and now made a strong effort\
        \ to complete it. He procured the help of the Rev. Michael Kinsella a learned\
        \ Ca puchin friar, and with his aid the work was prepared for the press. In\
        \ 1824 it appeared in four volumes, and \" is a work which,\" says Dr. Doyle,\
        \ \"for extensive knowledge, deep research, and accurate criticism, surpasses,\
        \ in my opinion, all that has ever been produced by the Established Church\
        \ collectively or in dividually in Ireland.\" Success had at last come, but\
        \ it was too late for the unfortunate author to enjoy. After the appearance\
        \ of the History he became partially deranged, and remained so in Dr. Harty's\
        \ asylum at Finglas near Dublin, till the 7th of July, 1828, when he passed\
        \ away at the age of seventy. He was buried in Finglas church yard, and his\

        \ when he had the good fortune to meet General Valiancy, the eccentric and\
        \ enthusi astic but good-hearted philologist. Through the general's influence,\
        \ who was vice-president of the Royal Dublin Society, he obtained a post in\
        \ that institution at the exceedingly moderate salary of a guinea and a half\
        \ a week. His duties seem to have been some thing of a sub-editorial kind\
        \ \u2014 translating, cor recting proofs, and making catalogues. During the\
        \ first few years of this employment he received occasional sums for extra\
        \ work, and in 1808, when he had outlived the opposition to him because of\
        \ his religion, his salary was increased to \xA3150 per annum, and he was\
        \ also appointed to the duties of assistant librarian. In this year also he\
        \ took a great share in the formation of the Gaelic Society of Dublin. SAINT\
        \ ITA OF MUNSTEE. (FROM \"ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY OF IRELAND.\") St. Ita, who\
        \ may justly be called the St. Bridget of Munster, was of the princely house\
        \ of the Desii or Nandesi, in the now county of Waterford. Her father's name\
        \ was Kenn foelad, her mother's Necta. They were Chris tians, as appears from\
        \ St. Ita having been baptized in her childhood. The time of her birth is\
        \ not recorded ; but it must have been some yeare prior to a.d. 484, if it\
        \ be true that she had for some time under her care Brendan of Clonfert when\
        \ an infant. Yet unless we are to suppose that she lived to an extra ordinary\
        \ great age, only a few years can be allowed for this priority of birth. .\
        \ . . While labouring for the Royal Society almost like a pack-horse, Lanigan\
        \ still found time at home to prepare for publication the first editiou of\
        \ the Roman Breviary ever pub lished in Ireland. In 1809 he published his\
        \ letters which had appeared up to that time in different magazines over the\
        \ signature \" Iren \xE6us,\" and he still continued to write further letters\
        \ up to 1811, when we find one in the Irish Magazine for May \" On the Imbecility\
        \ and Breaking up of the Present Ministry.\" It is related that while she\
        \ was still very young, a room in which she was asleep seemed to be all in\
        \ a blaze, and that some persons who hastened to extinguish what they thought\
        \ to be fire found it uninjured, and observed Ita, on awaking, to exhibit\
        \ an angelical form of exquisite beauty. Having reached the age fit for choosing\
        \ a permanent state of life she applied to her mother, and after expatiating\
        \ on the divine commandments requested of her to procure her father's permission\
        \ to consecrate herself to Christ. The mother acted according In the spring\
        \ of 1813 Lanigan's brain began to show signs of overwork, and rest from mental\
        \ labour became necessary. A holiday was granted him, during which he visited\
        \ his friends at Cashel. He returned to his labours apparently restored, but\
        \ the rest had been too short, and the recovery proved only temporary. During\
        \ 1814 he grew rapidly worse, and in November he resigned his post as librarian,\

        \ Napoleon heard this story, and made Baron Denon repeat it to him, laughing\
        \ immoderately all the time, and frequently after he would, when he saw Denon,\
        \ inquire \"how was poor Friday ? \" If ignorant \u2014 as is asserted \u2014\
        \ there is no symptom of it in her language. To be sure, she says little ;\
        \ but that little is expressed with propriety : and if reserved, she is scru\
        \ pulously polite. Her dames de compagnie and chambe'lan treat her with profound\
        \ respect, and she acknowledges their attentions with civility. To sum up\
        \ all, the impression made upon me by the Princesse Talleyrand was, that she\
        \ differed in no way from any other princess I had ever met, except by a greater\
        \ degree of reserve and formality than were in general evinced by them. BORES\
        \ AND TOADIES. (FROM \"CONFESSIONS OF AN ELDERLY LADY.\") The first visit\
        \ we paid was to the seat of the Marquis of Doncaster, in the eyes of whose\
        \ fastidious Marchioness I had been so fortunate as to find favour ; a distinction\
        \ rarely accordei i even to the most meritorious, and consequently sought\
        \ with greater avidity by those who valued it, as many other worthless objects\
        \ are valued, for its rarity. I could not help smiling inwardly when look\
        \ ing at her, as I remembered Baron Denon's amusing story of the mistake she\
        \ once made. When the baron's work on Egypt was the topic of general conversation,\
        \ and the hotel of the Prince Talleyrand was the rendezvous of the most distinguished\
        \ persons of both sexes at Paris, Denon being engaged to dine there one day,\
        \ the prince wished the princess to read a few pages of the book, in order\
        \ that she might be enabled to say something compli mentary on it to the author.\
        \ He consequently ordered bis librarian to send the work to her apartment\
        \ on the morning of the day of the dinner ; but, unfortunately, at the same\
        \ time also commanded that a copy of Robinson Crusoe should be sent to a young\
        \ lady, a pro tegee of hers, who resided in the hotel. The Baron Denon's work,\
        \ through mistake, was given to mademoiselle, and Robinson Crusoe was delivered\
        \ to the princess, who rapidly looked through its pages. The Marquis was a\
        \ dull, pompous, but not an ill-tempered man. Naturally disposed to entertain\
        \ a very high opinion of himself and his possessions, this feeling had been\
        \ encour aged by the partner he had selected to share them ; until he had\
        \ arrived at that happy, though not unfrequent state of mind, in which people\
        \ are so wholly engrossed by self as to become totally oblivious of others,\
        \ except in relation to themselves. The Marchioness of Doncaster never for\
        \ a moment forgot that she was of ancient descent, possessed immense wealth,\
        \ and arrogated great importance ; neither was she disposed to permit any\
        \ one else to forget these distinctions. The slightest symp tom of a want\
        \ of recollection on these points produced an increase of hauteur on her part,\
        \ and not unseldom a sententious diatribe on the respectful deference which\
        \ she considered to be her due. The seat of honour at table being assigned\
        \ to the baron, the princess, mindful of her husband's wishes, had no sooner\
        \ eaten her soup than, smiling graciously, she thanked Denon for the pleasure\
        \ which the perusal of his work had afforded her. The author was pleased,\
        \ and told her how much he felt honoured ; but judge of his astonishment,\
        \ and the dismay of the Prince Talleyrand, when the princess exclaimed, \"\
        Yes, Monsieur le Baron, your work has delighted me ; but I am loncin'' to\
        \ know what has become of your noor man Friday, about whom I feel such an\
        \ interest!\" Denon used to recount this anecdote with Such is the weakness\
        \ or meanness of the o-enerality of people, that she found no lack of persons\
        \ willing to propitiate her favour by a system of subserviency that served\
        \ to render her still more dictatorial; falsely attributing to her own acknowledged\
        \ superiority that which was but the proof of the unworthiness of her flatterers.\
        \ She and her lord lived in a state of complete illusion, and this illusion\
        \ constituted their happiness. They continually quoted each other's opinions,\
        \ as if they consid ered them worthy of forming a code to regu late the conduct\

        \ meagre, seco de carnes y enjuto de rostro, like Don Quixote, clean-shaven,\

        \ neckcloth with a very large bow, a broad-brimmed hat, and the ribbon of\
        \ the Legion of Honour. ' Eureka ! ' I cried mentially, ' here is the Nice\

        \ the Mazarin librarians. Perhaps a conchologist. Perhaps, even, an Academician.'\

        through the distant waters. "That ship will never return," said the old sailor,
        "she is overmasted." His prediction was, indeed, fulfilled ; for the Vestal
        sunk in one of those sudden squalls so frequently met with on the banks of
        Newfoundland. Mr. Knight, when he related his narrow escape from joining a
        crew, every one of whom met with a watery grave, acknowledged in the most
        feeling manner the merciful intervention of Providence in his preservation.
        He recollected very well seeing poor George Philp and his high-minded wife
        pass under the Church Bow on the morning of their fatal parting. He remembered
        the peculiar expression of Mrs. Philp''s countenance ; not a tear was in her
        eye, she was perfectly composed, but she looked as if her heart was dead within
        her. She was, he added, a most remarkable woman : one so resolute or so patient
        in hard fortune he had never seen. Mr. Knight, who died last year, was universally
        respected, and, as librarian, a loss to the town. Amongst the remarkable characters
        in this town deserving particular notice is Thomas Henwood, a youth whose
        promptitude and intrepidity in saving the life of a fellow-creature merit
        the highest praise, and have been rewarded by a silver medal from the Humane
        Society of London, and, above all, by that self-satisfaction which the remembrance
        of the cir cumstance must afford him to the last hour of his existence. Thomas
        Henwood, the son of poor but respectable parents, was about fifteen years
        old when the event I have to detail occurred. He was a lad of a quiet disposition,
        modest in his address, and always steady and industrious in his calling.',

        \ now before me) the Rev. E. A. Bray, Mr. John Commins, Mr. John Taylor, and\
        \ the Rev. W. Evans, of Park Wood. These gentlemen founded the Public Library\
        \ amongst themselves in the year 1799. They soon entertained hopes of widely\
        \ extending their plan, and the Duke of Bedford became the patron of this\
        \ most useful institution. Numerous subscribers in a short space gave in their\
        \ names, and a subscription was next proposed for the erection of a library\
        \ to contain the books, which had greatly increased in number. A sum of 1000/.\
        \ was, I believe, speedily raised, of which ioo/. was generously given by\
        \ John Rundle, Esq., the banker.3 Finally a portion of the Abbey, above the\
        \ archway that once formed the principal entrance, was fitted up by the Duke\
        \ of Bedford to receive the books, and thither they were placed. The library\
        \ is supported by yearly subscriptions, and a librarian receives a regular\
        \ salary from the sums thus collected. About five years ago an institution\
        \ was founded here for the purpose of giving lectures on any subjects connected\
        \ with art, science, or literature \u2014 religion and politics being alone\
        \ excluded, in order to prevent any disputes amongst the members of the society.\
        \ Mr. Bray recommended that, as this neighbourhood is so rich in minerals,\
        \ the society should add to their insti tution a Museum of native specimens\
        \ of every kind. These could be easily collected at a small expense ; and\
        \ geological specimens, from Dartmoor and else where, would likewise be useful\

        been introduced at our institutions, and a new librarian appointed in the
        place of Mr. Knight, recently deceased. I can not here resist the opportunity
        afforded of mentioning a very remarkable circumstance connected with Mr. Knight.
        You recollect the story I related of George Philp, in Mary''s book, who was
        lost, together with his young son, in the Vestal, off the coast of Newfoundland.
        Lieut. Edgcumbe5 was on board the ship; and Mr. Knight, then a boy, being
        related to Edgcumbe, was persuaded by him to go to sea in the next voyage
        he was to make with his captain. Young Knight con sented, and set off to join
        the Vestal at Plymouth at the appointed time. A trifling circumstance delayed
        him on the road, so that on his arrival he found him self too late ; for the
        Vestal had weighed anchor, and he caught sight of her, under a favouring gale,
        far out at sea, making her way rapidly through the waves. To join her proved
        impossible, for though he made the effort, the boat into which he immediately
        leaped could not reach the ship ; he was therefore obliged to put back. On
        landing, greatly disappointed in all his plans, young Knight found an old
        seaman standing alone on the beach, and still attentively observing 4 A museum

        \ it may interest our readers to learn, were by Cipriani, Dance, Richards,\
        \ Baker, and Benjamin West (after wards president). Sir Martin Archer Shee,\
        \ who will be remembered as the author of \" Rhymes on Art,\" and similar\
        \ works, was born in Dublin, in 1770. He came to London at the age of eighteen,\
        \ and in the following year exhibited at the Royal Academy. He became a Royal\
        \ Academician in 1800, and received the honour of knighthood on his appointment\
        \ to the presidential chair, in 1830. He died at Brighton, in 1850. A few\
        \ short notices of the distinguished men who have successively occupied the\
        \ presidential chair of the Royal Academy may not be out of place here. Sir\
        \ Joshua Reynolds, the first on the list, was a native of Plympton, near Plymouth,\
        \ in Devonshire, where he was born in the year 1723. At the age of seventeen\
        \ he became a pupil of Hudson, but after two years' study he returned to Plymouth.\
        \ He subsequently paid visits to Italy with Keppel, and afterwards settling\
        \ in London, founded the Literary Club, in conjunction with Johnson, in the\
        \ year 1764. He was a man highly cultivated and scholar-like, and had immense\
        \ power in grasping the principles of art ; in fact, he may be put down as\
        \ the real originator of the English school of painting. Among his principal\
        \ pictures may be mentioned, \"Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy,\" \" Mrs.\
        \ Siddons as the Tragic Muse,\" \"The Infant Hercules,\" \"Sheridan,\" &c.\
        \ Sir Joshua was appointed principal painter to the king in 1784, became partially\
        \ blind in 1789, and died in 1792. Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, the successor\
        \ of the above, was a native of Plymouth, and was born in 1793. He became\
        \ a student of the Royal Academy in 1808, and in early life paid visits to\
        \ Italy in company with Sir C. Barry and Brockendon. He was appointed Secretary\
        \ to the Commission of Fine Arts in 1841, and Librarian to the Royal Academy\
        \ in the following year. He was afterwards chosen Keeper of the National Gallery,\
        \ and subsequently became Director. He will be best remembered by his pictures\
        \ of \"Christ Weeping over Jerusalem\" and \"Christ Blessing Little Children.\"\
        \ Sir Charles Eastlake died at Pisa, in 1865. Sir Francis Grant, the late\
        \ President, was the fourth son of the late Mr. Francis Grant, of Kil graston,\
        \ Perthshire. He was born in 1803, and first exhibited at the Royal Academy\
        \ in 1834. He became an Associate in 1842, and attained full honours in 185\
        \ 1. He died in 1878. Benjamin West, his successor, who was born at Springfield,\
        \ in Pennsylvania, in 1738, was some what heavy and formal in his style of\
        \ painting. He visited Rome in 1760. and three years later arrived in England,\

        \ painter to the king in 1772, and occupied the presidential chair from 1792\
        \ down to his death in 1820. Sir Frederick Leighton, the present President,\

        \ in 1830. He was admitted an Associate in 1864, and elected a Royal Academician\

        \ many of them of great curiosity, rarity, and value, but have suffered injury\
        \ from dust and neglect; were they properly cleaned and repaired, and the\
        \ room made comfortable to readers, it would, in my opinion, be much frequented,\
        \ and accessions be made to the library in the way of books pre sented.\"\
        \ The original intention of the founder having thus been withheld, the interest\
        \ of the parishioners and others in this library gradually decreased, and\
        \ it at length became scarcely at all frequented on its own account. The place\
        \ had altogether a forlorn and miserable appearance ; its volumes buried in\
        \ dust and exposed to the vicissitudes of heat and damp, so that one would\
        \ be painfully reminded of the day when, under the auspices of the three illustrious\
        \ men mentioned above, the building was planned, and of the goodly show which\
        \ Strype tells us the books with their \" gilt backs\" made in his time. Newton\
        \ tells us, in his \" London in the Olden Time,\" that nearly at the end of\
        \ the Strand a country lane, without habitations, ran northwards between the\
        \ fields up to St. Giles's hospital. \"A small chapel or oratory,\" he adds,\
        \ \" we know not of what antiquity, stood in the thirteenth century by the\
        \ east side of this lane in the fields, about a hundred yards from the highway\
        \ of the Strand.\" He considers it probable that this chapel was saved by\
        \ the monks of St. Peter's Abbey, to whom the land about the neighbourhood\
        \ belonged, and who \" bestowed their benedictions on, and collected halfpennies\
        \ from the pilgrims and travellers passing to and from the north country and\
        \ the City of Westminster.\" This country road, which first obtained the name\
        \ of St. Martin's Lane about the reign of Charles I., was bounded on the eastern\
        \ side by the wall of the Convent Garden, and opened into the \" Cock and\
        \ Pie Fields,\" so called from a house of that name where cakes and ale were\
        \ sold. The Rev. P. Hale, the librarian, some time ago issued a \" Plea for\

        \ the vigilance and charity of his successor.\" At the bottom of St. Martin's\
        \ Lane was a nest or rookery of narrow lanes and streets, which rejoiced in\
        \ slang names, such as \" Porridge Island,\" \" The Bermudas,\" and the \"\

        \ ill of a heavy cold he had contracted during his journey. Here our story\
        \ parts from Dr. Adair, who returned to England, where he had a great many\
        \ fashionable acquaintances, and became a popular physician in Harro gate.\
        \ He was married to Charlotte Hamilton on the 16th November, 1789. His lovely\
        \ wife, who seems to have been amiable, beautiful, and even gifted (Burns\
        \ speaks of her \"eye beaming with mind\") fell into ill-health and died prematurely\
        \ in 1806. She had, as we saw previously, burnt a number of Burns' and Miss\
        \ Chalmers' letters. Dr. Adair volunteers a statement that his marriage with\
        \ Charlotte Hamilton was happy, and we do not deny it. But it were to inquire\
        \ too curiously if she, far away and hearing sad tales of her immortal friend,\
        \ never heaved a sigh, and along with it felt a wish, that she had either\
        \ \u2014 Primrose, to have loved them both at once, although, Mrs. Johnstone\
        \ thinks, he used the one as a stalking-horse to the other, and that his real\
        \ affections were centred, like a true poet's, in the one he never had a chance\
        \ of getting \u2014 Charlotte. Both were very superior women. Margaret Chalmers\
        \ was short in stature ; and although her portrait represents a highly-bred,\
        \ refined, and dignified face, she had little beauty. But she had great spirit\
        \ and ability, and whether loved or not, loving or not, she had undoubtedly\
        \ much influence on Burns ; a refining and softening influ ence, so long at\
        \ least as she was with him. That this would have been permanent, had they\
        \ come more closely together, we cannot say. Burns' manners were swayed perpetually\
        \ by his passions, which were terribly strong, and by his impulses, which\
        \ were exceedingly capricious. And it is so, we suspect, with most self-taught\
        \ men of genius. About this time he visited Dalswinton, but did not instantly\
        \ take a farm. In a letter to Miss Chalmers he talks about it and about it,\
        \ and seems exceedingly uncertain as to his future prospects. But his Muse\
        \ has not been idle. He has written a song on Charlotte, \"The Banks of the\
        \ Devon,\" and expects she will be highly pleased with it, and so no doubt\
        \ she was. He had inscribed some trifling Jacobitish verses to William Tytler,\
        \ the well-known defender of Mary Queen of Scots. And he had written a manly\
        \ letter to Sir John Whitefoord, one of his Ayrshire patrons, vindicating\
        \ his own character against the calumnies by which he had been assailed, especially\
        \ in reference to the affair with poor Jean Armour, and to his presumed religious\
        \ opinions. Besides the business of the farm, Burns had the annoyance of a\
        \ reluc tant and dilatory publisher, who was in no hurry to settle accounts\
        \ with him for his very successful poems. Robert Chambers, himself a publisher,\
        \ gives a statement of the Creech affair which is not very luminous, and we\
        \ do not presume to understand the mystery better than he. He is right, however,\
        \ when he says that Burns, instead of getting angry, should have put the affair\
        \ into the hands of a legal deputy. But when he speaks of him repairing to\
        \ Mossgiel, and writing fresh poems in the style of \"Halloween\" and \"The\
        \ Cottar's Saturday Night\" he shows a misapprehension, as he did formerly,\
        \ of the source of Burns' inspiration. \" Halloweens\" and \"Cottar's Satur\
        \ day Nights\" do not come at the magic of mere money. Burns' heart and passions\
        \ were his muses. His account was not yet to be settled for four months. In\
        \ spite of Creech's delay Burns had now determined to leave Edin burgh, when\
        \ another Will-o'-the-wisp shot across his path, and had well-nigh changed\
        \ its course for ever and a day. \" Never met or never parted \" from one\
        \ who so long and fondly cherished her memory, and who was yet to see that\
        \ beauty which he had admired at the Cauldron Linn glassed to his imagination\
        \ in the waters of the Black River ! Burns, returned, began again to think\
        \ of Dumfriesshire as a place to set up the staff of his rest ; but ere he\
        \ took any definite step he settled down in Edinburgh for some months ; lived\
        \ in the house of William Cruickshank, one of the High School teachers ; and\
        \ got his daughter Janet, a girl of twelve, to learn his songs by heart and\
        \ play them on the piano, and rewarded her for doing so by writing some beautiful\
        \ verses in her praise. Jenny Cruickshank, who became a fine girl, married\
        \ a Mr. Henderson, a lawyer in Jedburgh ; and a lady, her daughter-in-law,\
        \ showed Chambers a china punch bowl which Burns, according to tradition,\
        \ had broken in one of his bouts in her father's house in St. James' Square.\
        \ (Ah ! that measureless liar, Tradition ! If we could believe it, we saw\
        \ a year or two ago in the North of Scotland the very china saucer out of\
        \ which Byron, in one of his boy rages, bit a piece, and there was the piece,\
        \ too *). He threw himself into Johnson's plan of collecting songs with all\
        \ his heart, and wrote many for him without money and without price. He got\
        \ into a correspondence with James Hoy, librarian at Gordon Castle, a great\
        \ enthusiast in Scottish song. He received a nice letter from his old master,\
        \ Murdoch, now in London, and he wrote regularly to his two Harvieston flames\
        \ ; for he seemed, like Squire Thorn hill in the \" Vicar of Wakefield \"\
        \ with Olivia and Sophia * We have heard since that evidence is soon to be\
        \ produced by Dr. Thorn of Stonehaven in proof of this tradition.", 1]

        \ come into collision. He suspected that they had spread reports against his\
        \ loyalty to the Board of Excise ; they feared his power of scathing sarcasm,\
        \ and cowered at the flash of his dark eye. They not only came between him\
        \ and Mrs. Riddell, but on another occasion Miss Benson, afterwards Mrs. Basil\
        \ Montagu, met his displeasure for mingling with these \"epauletted puppies,\"\
        \ as he called them, and seeming to neglect him. They got a handle against\
        \ him, when one evening heated with wine in a private company he gave as a\
        \ toast \u2014 \" May our success in the present war be equal to the justice\
        \ of 'our cause!'\" At these words a captain present chose to be so seriously\
        \ offended that a quarrel was the consequence, and Burns the next morning\
        \ had to write a letter which was equiva lent to a humble apology. Worst of\
        \ all, Mr. Riddell having returned, and Burns having resumed his visits to\
        \ Woodley Park, he one day committed himself by a name less insult to his\
        \ fair hostess, in remorse for which he next morning indited a letter to her\
        \ purporting, to be written in the abode of the damned ; this produced a breach\
        \ between them, which gradually widened into a great gulph fixed till very\
        \ near his end, and Burns took his revenge by certain bitter lampoons, which\
        \ did as little honour to his gentlemanly feeling as to his genius. Rejected\
        \ at Woodley Park, he continued his visits to Tinwald Downs, where John Bushby\
        \ was landlord \u2014 a remarkable person, who had risen from the ranks to\
        \ opulence, was a solicitor, a banker, a country gentleman, kept open table,\
        \ and had Burns often among his guests. It is said that Burns sometimes preferred\
        \ dining in the room of the housekeeper, a decent lady reduced in circumstances,\
        \ and afterwards was brought up along with a new batch of claret, like a bag-pipe\
        \ player, to amuse the company. Chambers hints that Burns liked this : he\
        \ might at times, at other times he stormed. The story at least is told that\
        \ when once brought up stairs and to table, like Samson to make the people\
        \ sport, he showed what terrible sport a Samson could make by pouring out\
        \ a torrent of invective, flaked by oaths, shaking the pillars of the house,\
        \ and rushing out in unceremonious haste and recalcitrating fury ! This perhaps\
        \ is a mythical, but decidedly improved version, of Chambers' tales about\
        \ Burns being snared by Bushby into swallowing a piece of pudding boiling\
        \ hot, while Bushby laughed till the tears were gushing out at his eyes in\
        \ emulous sympathy with those produced by heat in the eyes of Burns ; and\
        \ Burns got angry, and this little bit of hot pudding led to a long coolness\
        \ between them \u2014 an incident altogether more characteristic of the \"\
        Bashful Man \" in fiction than of a being like Burns in reality. At all events\
        \ Burns and Bushby ceased to be friends, and the poet visited the offences\
        \ of the sire on the son in his lines \"\xC6sopus to Maria,\" in which he\
        \ lashes Bushby While on this ungrateful subject, we may as well quote what\
        \ Byron says of Burns' letters, which had been shown him by Allen, Lord Holland's\
        \ librarian \u2014 a man of vast and curious erudition : \u2014 \" Allen has\
        \ lent me a quantity of Burns' unpublished and never to be published letters.\
        \ They are full of oaths and obscene songs. What an antithetical mind ! tenderness,\
        \ roughness, delicacy, coarse ness, sentiment, sensuality, soaring and grovelling,\
        \ dirt and Deity, all mixed up in one compound of poor clay.\" This is from\
        \ his Journal ; but in his Letter to Bowles he says farther \u2014 \" I have\
        \ seen myself a collection of letters of another eminent \u2014 nay, pre-eminent\
        \ \u2014 deceased poet, so abominably gross and elaborately coarse, that I\
        \ do not believe they could be paralleled in our language. What is more strange\
        \ is, that some of them are couched as post scripts to his serious and sentimental\
        \ letters, to which are tacked either a piece of prose or some verses of the\
        \ most hyperbolical obscenity. He himself says that 'if obscenity (he uses\
        \ a much coarser word) were the sin against the Holy Ghost, he most certainly\
        \ could not be saved.' \" We have not seen the letters referred to, but perhaps\
        \ Mr. White's statement points out one way of explaining them \u2014 the sentimental\
        \ part might be written before dinner, and the postscript added after. This\
        \ is an explanation, though, of course, not a sufficient palliation of the\
        \ offence. Burns, writing to Mrs. Dunlop, Dr. Moore, and Dugald Stewart, could\
        \ not have written obscenely ; since he would not, one would think, have allowed\
        \ himself to write to them if he had been in this state. Writing to others\
        \ whom he respected less, he might have permitted wine and passion to have\
        \ their way ; and then, as when he was with the innkeeper, the Burns vanished,\
        \ the Brute survived (and is there hot more or less of the brutal nature in\
        \ all men?), and hence came the \" hyperbolical obscenity.\" \u25A0 During\
        \ the summer of 1793 Burns was little at Woodley Park ; Mrs. Riddell was away\
        \ in London for some months, and afterwards her husband was called suddenly\
        \ on busi ness to the West Indies, and when he returned found her alone in\
        \ the mansion house. Here Burns, according to the etiquette of the times,\
        \ and perhaps also owing to his peculiar reputation, was not permitted to\
        \ visit her, but would have occasionally entered her box at the theatre had\
        \ it not been for what he calls \" lobster-coated puppies,\" i.e., officers\

        On the 8th of April, 1799, the Douglas Social Library Associ ation was formed,
        with Rev. Isaac Stone for librarian. The li brary was composed of standard
        works, of which a full list is not now iu existence, but it probably contained
        not more than about sixty volumes. These comprised a set of Rollin''s Ancient
        History, Josephus'' Works, Winterbottom''s History of America, Robertson''s
        Scotland, Edwards'' History ofthe Reformation, Goldsmith''s Eng land, Marshall''s
        Life of Washington, and a few others of a like nature. The fines imposed for
        damages done to the books, etc., were rigidly enforced. It may be well to
        note some of these : For a leaf turned clown, six cents ; for a drop of tallow,
        or any other spot, six cents ; for a tear, or writing that does not deface
        the read ing, six cents. " If a member keeps a book out over two ordinary
        months he shall pay a fine of one ceut per day until returned. Any person
        that doth not return the book or books they may have taken out, at least four
        hours before the time of day stated for the annual meeting, shall pa}- a fine
        of twenty-five cents for such neglect ; and if any member shall lend a book
        out of the company they shall pay a fine of fifty cents." These rules, no
        doubt, account in a measure for the fine state of preservation in which the
        books are found even at the present day. On the 10th of April, 1815, Rev.
        David Hol man was chosen librarian, but the library was not removed to his
        house till 1825. The books and other property of the Association were offered
        at public sale, and the proceeds were to be divided among the members. Not
        finding a purchaser, the books remained for years with Mr. Holman, and all
        who cared to read them had full liberty to do so.', 2]

        of Douglas, Sherborn, ancl other places, many of these being difficult to

        express his thanks to all those who have contributed to lighten his labors
        in the compilation of the work, and begs leave to refer in a special manner
        to Rev. E. A. Manning, whose experience as a writer made him an invaluable
        assistant in the work of reducing the material from a crude state to its present
        attractive form and arrangement. Also to William H. Briggs, Esq., George W.
        Spencer, Edwin Moore, Aaron M. Hill, Bev. William T. Briggs, Rev. W. W. Dow,
        Ira Wallis, Jus tin B. Whipple, A. F. Brown, Esq., and Joseph Hunt, who have
        in various ways rendered him most valuable service. For many of the historical
        facts obtained he feels under great obligation to the American Antiquarian
        Society of Worcester, to whose extensive repository of buried learning he
        has had constant access, through the kindness of the Librarian, S. F. Haven,
        Esq., as well as to the courteous Assistant Librarian, Mr. Edmund Bar ton,
        without whose valuable aid the historical worth of the work would have been
        much diminished. For statistics relating to the war of the rebellion he has
        relied chiefly npon the reports of Adjutant-General Schouler, and the statements
        of soldiers who participated in the struggle. He is also indebted to Samuel
        Elias Staples, Esq., President of the Worcester Society of Antiquity, and
        to Professor Homer B. Sprague of Boston, for the interest they have shown

        \ the supply of the village with water. At the annual election in 1871, the\
        \ people authorized the newly-elected board to issue the bonds of the village\
        \ for the construction of water-works. Charles G. Denison, presi dent of the\
        \ village, and A. H. Gorton were appointed the supervising committee, who\
        \ purchased a piece of land for a reservoir, at the head of Pine Street, 210\
        \ feet above the village, and entered into a contract with the Gloucester\
        \ Iron- Works, of Philadelphia, to construct the reservoir and lay the necessary\
        \ pipes. The work was completed at the contract price, $20,000, in September,\
        \ 1872, including the reservoir, 2126 feet of 8-inch pipe, 3225 feet of 6-inch\
        \ pipe, 3434 feet of 4-inch pipe, 268 feet of 3-inch pipe, 20 branches, 22\

        \ established at a never-failing pond of beautiful clear spring water, in\
        \ the lower part of the village. The reservoir on the hill is sup plied with\
        \ water from the creek, known as Monkey Run, and is sufficient for all purposes\

        to make way for the new building, and George III. then resided in the comfortable-looking
        but very unpalatial house now known as Kew Palace, of which we have given
        an engraving at the head of this chapter. There it was that the old King was

        meeting the town refused an appropriation. A second meeting was afterward
        held, at which the sum of $4000 was voted for this purpose, and the committee

        to the new building in March, 1874. room, where any one is at liberty to examine
        them. For each shelf there is a little box, like a post-office box, bearing
        the number of the shelf, in which are placed the tickets given for the books
        which are drawn out from that shelf. These simple arrangements are found to
        facilitate, perhaps as much as possible, the task of finding any particular
        book on the shelves, or, if it is missing there, of tracing it to the person
        into whose hands it has gone. The memorial hall and library building stands
        deservedly in the front rank of similar buildings in this country. The memorial
        hall, the most imposing portion of the building, constitutes the main entrance,
        and is 64 by 40 feet. The hall is 25 feet square, with bays on each side 5
        feet deep. The floor is of marble, and the ceiling 20 feet high. It is eased
        in black walnut and ash, elaborately carved and highly finished. On each side,
        in the recesses, will be placed the tablets con taining the memorial records
        of our fallen soldiers. In the rear of the hall is a building, 80 by 54 feet
        and two stories high, containing the library and reading-room. At the rear
        end of the memorial hall is a broad flight of steps ascending six feet to
        the library-room. At either side of this ascending entrance-way is a stairway
        descending to the reading-room. From the landing-place at the library-doors
        ascend steps on each side to the museum and art-room immediately above the
        memorial hall, and occupying the entire front of the building. The library-room
        is 79 by 51 feet, with a nave in the centre 26 feet wide and 27 feet high.
        The books are arranged in cases directly beneath the nave in the centre of
        the room, and inclosed in a neat iron railing, giving ample room outside for
        the use of visitors. The cases are 10 feet long and 7 feet high, and when
        the entire space is filled with them there will be ample room for 32,000 volumes.
        The entire capacity of the building is sufficient for three or four times
        that number of books. On the same floor with the library are four smaller
        rooms, two on each side of the memorial hall. Those on the west side are used,
        the larger as a general reception-room, and the smaller for books on art and
        costly volumes not to be taken from the building. These two rooms have been
        handsomely and luxuriantly furnished by L. B. Williams, Esq., of North ampton.
        The two rooms on the opposite side are used, the larger as a consulting-room,
        in which works of reference, to be examined only in the building, are kept,
        and the smaller as the librarian''s private apartment. Directly below the
        library is the reading-room, which is 38 by 51 feet, with smaller rooms in
        the rear, used for storage, work-room-, etc. Here is also a circular stairway
        leading from the cellar to the library-room, and two elevators for books and
        packages. There are two entrances to the reading-room, one on each side of
        the building, just in the rear of the memorial hall. In the front of the building
        and under the hall arc cloak room, lavatory, water-closets, etc. In the cellar,
        extending under the entire building, is the steam-boiler by which the whole
        is warmed. The total cost of building and grounds was $77,249.79. The number
        of books on the shelves of the librarj'' is now not far from 12,000. At the
        publication of the previous cata logue, in 1862, the number of volumes was
        stated to be 4500. The increase within the last thirteen years has been about
        7500 volumes. A large portion of this increase has been made within the last
        four years, and has been purchased with the income of the John Clarke fund.
        It cannot be expected, however, that the library will continue to increase
        as rapidly in the future, as no small portion of the income of the fund is
        now swallowed up in running expenses, the town having rescinded the vote dedicating
        the income of the fund to the purchase of books, and at the same time decreasing
        the amount of its annual appropriation. The fund of $40,000, represented by
        $50,000 second-mort gage bonds of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, was among
        the securities stolen from the Northampton National Bank at the time of the
        great robbery in 1876, and have not yet been recovered. No income has been
        received from them for two years, while the road has been in the hands of
        a receiver. For many years the duties of librarian have been performed in
        a most satisfactory manner by the present librarian, Miss C. S. Laidley, who
        was first chosen to that position when the library was first opened in the
        present town-hall. The in creased labors incident to a larger circulation
        of books, and its removal to the new building, demanded other assistance,
        es pecially in the evenings, when six persons are usually busily employed.
        The library is in a very prosperous condition, and reflects great credit upon
        the enterprise and intelligence of the citi zens of Northampton. BANKS. NORTHAMPTON
        BANK. The first banking institution established in this town was the old Northampton
        Bank, organized March 31, 1803, with the following directors : Ebenezer Hunt,
        Jonathan Dwight, Samuel Porter, Oliver Smith, Benj. Prescott, and Erastus
        L3''man. Levi Shepherd was the first president, and Levi Lyman the first cashier.
        The bank went into operation in the fall of 1803, when a new board of directors
        was chosen, at which Samuel Hensaw was chosen president, Mr. Lyman continuing
        as cashier. The institution was comparatively short-lived, continuing about
        a dozen years. THE HAMPSHIRE BANK The building was occupied in March, 1874,
        and the library rearranged, a new catalogue printed, and the whole opened
        to the public on the 30th of March, 1874. The books are classified and arranged
        on the shelves in a new and very con venient manner, devised by Rev. Wm. S.
        Leavitt, who, for the last half-dozen years, has efficiently and satisfactorily
        managed the affairs of the institution. The arrangement of the books is such
        that, however the library may be increased, each class can always be kept
        by itself in adjoining cases. The first figure is the number of a shelf; 1,
        2, etc., up to 9, designate the class to which the books on that shelf belong.
        Thus all books whose shelf numbers commence with the figure 1 belong in the
        class of fiction or juvenile literature ; all commencing with figure 2 belong
        under biography; figure 3, history, travel, voyages, and so on up to 9, which
        includes art, architecture, and illustrated works. There is a tenth class,
        comprising books of reference, which have no numbers attached to them, but
        are kept in the consulting- was organized Aug. 15, 1813, with the following-named
        di rectors : Joseph Lyman, Ebenezer Mattoon, Seth Wright, Oliver Smith, and
        Ebenezer Hunt, Jr. Joseph Lyman was elected president, and Thos. Swan cashier.
        The capital stock was $100,000. This bank continued in operation about twenty
        years, with Hon. Joseph Lyman as president during the entire period. THE NORTHAMPTON
        NATIONAL BANK. The Northampton Bank, of which the National Bank is the successor,
        was organized April 13, 1833, with a capital of $100,000, which was increased
        in 1837 to $200,000. The first board of directors was constituted as follows
        : Eliphalet Wil liams, Thos. Napier, Lewis Strong, and John Hopkins, of Northampton;
        David Mack, Jr., of Amherst; Thos. White, of Ashfield ; and Nathan Coolidge,
        of Hadley. Eliphalet Williams was chosen president, which position he held
        until 1850, when he resigned, and J. D. Whitney was chosen his successor.
        He remained in the office nine months, when Mr. L''l', 3]

        \ NORTHAMPTON, originated from a desire t'p strengthen the cause of evangelical\
        \ religion in the town. It- originators were urged by two stic cessive pastors\
        \ of tin- First Church to commence this enterprise as a matter of duty. Tin-\
        \ tow n was growing, the parish church ll:,,l become too large for the care\
        \ us one pastor, and another organization of the same faith was imperatively\
        \ demanded. Such was the argument used to induce certain members of the First\
        \ Church to separate and form the Edwards Church. When the fourth meeting-house\
        \ was erected in 1812 many in. H. i. irs of the church were desirous of building\
        \ two houses of worship and organizing a second Congregational society. Tin-\
        \ majority, however, preferred ihe erection of a large house, with the hope\
        \ of retaining the whole population under the ministry of one clergyman. This\
        \ expectation, however, was not realized, for in lX'JH, as ha- already been\
        \ Stated, the I'ni tarian Society was organized. In the summer of 1881 the\
        \ parish numbered about 2800 souls, and the necessity for a division became\
        \ apparent. Muchdiscussi nsued, and Bev. Sir. Spencer, colleague pa-tor with\
        \ Mr. William-, strongl) urged the measure. In 1X32, 37 member- obtained the\
        \ con sent of the First Church, were dismissed from il 1 pro ceeded to organize\
        \ a new s^iety under the name of the \" Ed wards Church.\" Accordingly, 93\
        \ members (42 males and 51 females) applied for letters of dismission, which\
        \ were granted in a Christian spirit, and they were organized into a church\
        \ by a council con \\. in .1 Jan. 29, 1833, of which council Rev. Solomon\
        \ Williams, pastor of Ihe First Church, Northampton, President Hum phrej .\
        \ of Amherst College, and l>r. Hawes, of Hartford, were members. The name\
        \ Edwards Church was adopted in mem ory of the distinguished Jonathan Edwards,\
        \ whose preaching and theological writings gave fame to Northampton in this\
        \ country and in Europe. Before the close of the year the Edwards Church had\

        \ upon a beautiful plateau overlooking the meadows and Northampton beyond.\
        \ The centre of the little settlement is stated as the point where the road\

        \ here, the imagination can but faintly picture the scenes of that fearful\
        \ morning, \u2014 the surprise, the slaughter, the burning, and the leading\

        \ to the culture of civilization. The Manhan still flows onward to the Con\

        \ ancient hamlet, but all else have changed. and other relics of the war,\

        \ the work of David M. Strangford ; a collection of sea-shells ; curi osities\

        \ (a native of the town), and in part donated by him. Besides the portraits,\
        \ the walls are adorned by several fine engravings.\" It should be added that\
        \ there was an early library association organized in 1792, and composed of\
        \ about thirty persons at first, who paid two dollars each and a small annual\
        \ sum. In the progress of years quite a library was collected, and Rev. Payson\
        \ Williston officiated as librarian for thnMy-five years. In 1842 it was united\
        \ with the Youths' Library Association, an organization formed for literary\
        \ improvement, in 1828. Its members paid one dollar as a membership fee, and\
        \ an annual tax of twenty-five cents. After the union the name was changed\
        \ to the Easthampton Social Library Association. The library was removed to\
        \ the town-hall, and though there was at times little interest in the matter,\
        \ yet it continued down to nearly the date of the formation of the corporate\
        \ society above noticed, and was really a praiseworthy affair, having an existence,\
        \ in one form or another, seventy years or more. Fort Plain, so called, in\
        \ the rear of East Street school house, is understood to derive its name from\
        \ the location there of the Indian fort of 1664. This was one of the abiding\
        \ places, or headquarters, of the remnant of the Non-o-tucks who remained\
        \ in this vicinity for some years after the sale of their lands. The opening\
        \ troubles of King Philip's war ex cited the old feelings of hostility, and,\
        \ expecting to be disarmed or captured by the whites, these few Indians retired\
        \ up the valley, and never returned. This was their last residence within\
        \ the limits of Easthampton. From this \"plain\" they took up their northward\
        \ march, leaving forever the fields of their fathers and the streams and hunting-grounds\
        \ of their ancestral Non-o-tuck. It contained some valuable works, \u2014\
        \ Rollin's History, Jose phus' History. A library meeting was held once in\
        \ three months. When several wanted the same book they used to bid for it.\
        \ The company of troops from Northampton that pursued the Indians after the\
        \ Pascommuck slaughter overtook them on the well-known Wait farm. The exact\
        \ field of the skir mish is not known, but in this immediate vicinity Capt.\
        \ John Taylor was killed, and here the Indians massacred the little boys,\
        \ sparing only Elisha Searl, who made signs that he would go with them willingly.\
        \ THE FARMERS' CLUB OF EASTHAMPTON. This was organized in 1858 to promote\
        \ the interests of the farming community by the holding of meetings and inter\
        \ change of views and experiences. The society has kept up its operations\
        \ nearly every year since it began. Several ex hibitions of fruit, vegetables,\
        \ and stock have been held which were very successful and reflected great\
        \ credit upon the mem bers. Many professional and business-men not engaged\
        \ in farming have found the meetings and social gatherings a pleasant place\
        \ of resort, and have contributed much to their success. Professors in the\
        \ seminary, pastors of the churches, merchants, and factory-men are often\
        \ \"farmers\" for the time being. Samuel Janes, one of the boys whom the Indians\
        \ had tomahawked and left for dead, however, recovered, and lived to a good\
        \ old age. He was the ancestor of the present fami lies of that name in town.\
        \ The other points of considerable historic interest \u2014 the loca tion\
        \ of the first settler, John Webb, the first mills, the place of the first\
        \ district-meeting, and other similar points \u2014 are fully noted elsewhere.\
        \ INDUSTRIAL PURSUITS. It may have been proper to say before 1847 that agriculture\
        \ was the principal occupation of the people of Easthampton. It could hardly\
        \ be true at any time since. Considerable wheat was raised in the early times,\
        \ while the soil still abounded in the elements of fertility ; flax was also\
        \ an object of culture ; but both of these ceased to be remunerative, and\
        \ were mostly abandoned years ago. Rye, corn, oats, and potatoes soon be came\
        \ the staple crops, and have been for many years. The officers for the present\
        \ winter (1878-79) are Major H. E. Alvord, President ; Lewis E. Janes, Secretary.\
        \ There are many other organizations of a social, benevolent, or educational\
        \ character existing in Easthampton. Among these, including some that have\
        \ dissolved and others that are maintained somewhat irregularly, may be mentioned\
        \ the Easthampton Mutual Relief Society, organized to do a life insurance\
        \ business ; the Ionic Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, and associated with\
        \ it the Doric Chapter of the order of the Eastern Star, to which mothers,\
        \ wives, sisters, and daughters of Masons are admitted ; the Humboldt Lodge,\
        \ D. 0. H., No. 97, \u2014 a mutual German relief society; the Caledonian\
        \ Thistle Club, for similar purposes among the Scotch residents ; the St.\
        \ Patrick's Mutual Benevolent So ciety, with a similar object among the Irish\
        \ citizens; a Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry ; the Young People's\
        \ Literary Society ; a Lyceum ; a Young People's Temperance organization,\
        \ and other societies of a like char acter. Easthampton shares largely in\
        \ all these elements of modern progress and mutual aid. During the last twenty-five\
        \ years large quantities of tobacco have been grown, and the business was\
        \ exceedingly profitable for a portion of the time. It is yet grown extensively,\
        \ though like other agricultural products it is greatly reduced in price.\
        \ The extent of the manufactures of the town compels this notice of the farming\
        \ interests to be condensed into a brief allusion. Mills, Factories, etc.\
        \ \u2014 Upon the small tributaries of the Manhan flowing from the north there\
        \ seem to have been no mill privileges improved except upon the one known\
        \ as Saw mill Brook. Upon this, near the Northampton line, was a saw-mill,\
        \ dating back to 1803. It was owned at various times by Capt. John Phelps\
        \ ; by Elisha C. and Asa Strong with other proprietors ; by E. W. Lyman ;\
        \ by Jonathan and Cal vin Strong, of Northampton ; and probably there were\
        \ others who at times owned shares. The mill was destroyed in the freshet\
        \ of 1854, and there are now no buildings near the old site. PLACES OF HISTORIC\

        \ next oldest burying-ground to be the one near the pond, about two miles\
        \ northwest of the central vil lage. It was probably laid out soon after the\
        \ first one, and of course not later than 1766. No others existed for a number\
        \ of years, and on March 11, 1771, the town appropriated \xA330 for the purpose\

        \ to the charge. Early in his pastorate measures were instituted looking to\
        \ the erection of a church edifice. In the month of June, 1873, land was purchased\
        \ for the erection of a church, and during the Same year the society purchased\

    - ['PUBLISHER''S PREFACE. State Librarian of New York, considers the illustrated
        portion, including personal sketches of prominent citizens, a feature which
        will become more interesting with the lapse of time, and one which gives additional
        value to the work. The illustrations of each town, like its written history,
        are distinct and complete in themselves, and are selected as fair representatives
        of its worthy citizens, independently of any comparison with those of any
        other city or town. The highest ideal is not always reached, but the endeavor
        has been to handle this department with due regard to the rules of propriety
        and consistency, the tastes and desires of the people of the Valley, and the
        true interests of the publisher and the community. This explanation is rendered
        necessary by the fact that there have been those who criticised without thoroughly
        understanding the system adopted, and without giving the subject due consideration.
        Every effort has been put forth to render this work as complete in all departments
        as possible, and to bring it fully up to the expectations of those who have
        so liberally indorsed it, with the confident belief that they will appreciate
        the labor and patient research necessary in the production of a work which
        contains, among other items, a hundred thousand proper names, and at least
        one thousand biographies and per sonal sketches. Perfection is impossible,
        but the work is placed in the hands of its patrons with the hopeful assurance
        that its immense array of interesting facts will be invaluable to the student
        and his torian, to the professional man and the mechanic, and to the farmer
        in the midst of his family. The writers engaged upon the work have been almost
        invariably treated with the greatest courtesy, and have had every facility

        \ North College by Prof. Amos Eaton; the first catalogue published March,\

        \ number, generally supplied the remainder of the exercises. Gerard Hiilloek,\
        \ then princi pal of the academy, delivered a poem. The act relating to the\
        \ Charity Fund provided for the elec tion of a board of \" overseers of the\

        \ upon. The town of Norwich thus organized continued with nearly or quite\
        \ the same territory for about eighty years. A radical change then took place.\
        \ The movement began at Chester village, so called, a thriving business place,\
        \ which had grown up on the line of the Boston and Albany Railroad. The people\
        \ of that village were in a very peculiar condition as to town and county\
        \ lines. The line between Blandford and Chester passed through one meeting-house\
        \ and through a dwelling house, so that a tenant who lived in a corner room\
        \ went to Chester to vote, and the others in the house went several miles\
        \ the other way, and there were other cases nearty as ludicrous and inconvenient.\
        \ Local jurisdiction was badly mixed. It was pretty easy to change one's location\
        \ from town to town, and even from county to county. Officers were sadly perplexed\
        \ to find their \" precepts\" sometimes just failing, while the expected prisoner\
        \ stood only a few rods or feet away. The people first endeavored to secure\
        \ the erection of an entire new town. When this movement failed they then\
        \ looked around for the next best thing to be attempted, and they asked to\
        \ be annexed to Norwich. This was successful, receiving the assent of the\
        \ people of Norwich and the authority of the Legislature. In the warrant for\
        \ the March meeting of 1855 there was inserted the clause, \" To see if the\
        \ town will accept the name of Huntington,\" and \"To see if the town will\
        \ reimburse the inhabitants of Chester village for their expenses incurred\
        \ in bringing about the annexation.\" At the meeting it was voted not to accept\
        \ the name Huntington, and to pass over the article in relation to reimbursing\
        \ the inhabitants of Chester village. At the adjourned annual meeting held\
        \ March 26, 1855, M. Copeland reported the following act of the Legislature\
        \ : \"Commonwealth of Massachusetts: \" An ACT to authorize the town us Xnririrh\

        \ silence, for the sole entry below is: \"Voted to adjourn. Lyman Dimock,\
        \ Town Clerk.\" The following letter from C. P. Huntington is entered in the\
        \ town records : \" Northampton, Oct. 23, 1855. When the annexation was effected\
        \ the town became so much of a new affair that there was some reason in desiring\

        \ not immediately accomplished. There was either no great activity in the\
        \ matter or considerable opposition was felt. The following notes from the\
        \ town records show the steps taken both in the annexation and the change\

        \ Esq., of Northampton, the well-known and distinguished attorney, who had\

        \ as much more, with a provision for an annual subscription of a dollar or\
        \ two on a share. I was hoping I might have seen you some leisure moment,\
        \ and inquire whether you had anything of the kind. I can think of nothing\

        \ in the effort now being made by the inhabi tants of Chester village residing\
        \ in the towns of Chester and Blandford, to be set off from their respective\
        \ towns and annexed to the town of Norwich, and pass any vote on the same.\"\
        \ At this meeting Aaron B. Dimock was chosen moderator, and the project received\
        \ an ample consideration, and the mo tion to concur was passed by a large\
        \ majority. \"Tours, truly, C. P. Huntington.\" The territory was annexed,\
        \ and the old town of Norwich was thus enlarged by a handsome addition upon\
        \ the south, in cluding the thriving place then known as Chester village.\
        \ The old name, Norwich, was not entirely satisfactory to the people of the\
        \ annexed territory, and a movement to secuj-e a new name commenced not long\
        \ after the reconstruction of the town-lines. Upon this proposition a committee\
        \ was appointed, \u2014 G. Mun son, W. Stevens, Elkanah Ring, Jr., James Jones,\
        \ William Henry. The committee reported favorably at the annual meeting, March\
        \ 10, 1856, and in accordance therewith the town voted to accept Mr. Huntington's\

        \ out the same,\u2014 Garry Munson, W. Stevens, E. Ring, Jr., James Jones,\

        \ was then divided, and it was voted \" to accept so much of the report as\
        \ relates to the petitioning of the Legisla ture for a change of name.\" Voted\
        \ to strike out the word Stanley and accept the remainder of the report. Voted\

        \ four or five years. Near the commencement of his labors there was a re vival\

        \ in 1876 at the same place, which has also been published. After this the\
        \ number of members became much reduced, partly in consequence of the organization\
        \ of Baptist churches at other points, where a portion of the members found\
        \ them selves better convenienced. A number of ministers supplied the desk\

        \ Wakefield, each of whom succes sively acted as pastor, devoting at the same\
        \ time half of his services to the neighboring church at Three Rivers, in\

        \ and con tinued in that capacity four years. The next pastor was Rev. Moses\
        \ Curtis, who commenced his labors in 1842. The church had now occupied their\
        \ house of worship for nearly thirty years. Of ample dimensions and highly\
        \ creditable to the en terprise of the society when it was erected, it had\
        \ come to need at their hands substantial repairs. Just at this time the re\
        \ union of the Congregational Churches, already referred to, was effected,\
        \ and the house of worship of the Brainerd Church was left vacant. It was\
        \ purchased by the Baptists, who made it their house of worship and began\
        \ to occupy it with the com mencement of Mr. Curtis' labors. The house is\
        \ still occupied by the society, although it has undergone considerable remod\
        \ eling and repairing in their hands, notably in 1869 and 1875. In 1849, Mr.\
        \ Curtis resigned his charge, and was soon after succeeded by Rev. Joseph\
        \ M. Rockwood, who in turn resigned in January, 1856. Rev. William N. Fay\
        \ succeeded him in February, 1850, but was really settled as pastor in June\
        \ of that year. He remained until December, 1800, when he resigned on account\
        \ of ill health, much to the regret not only of the society, but of the entire\
        \ community. He went to Blooming ton, 111., and there died soon after. By\
        \ his own request his body was brought to Belchertown and interred among the\
        \ people he had loved. At the time of the union of the two churches in 1841,\
        \ Daniel Phelps, John M. Spooner, Israel Towne, and Wm. Phelps were the officiating\
        \ deacons in the First Church, and Henry A. Bridgman, Elijah Amidon, and Elisha\

        \ 1850, when all resigned, and the church then chose Daniel Phelps, Israel\
        \ Towne, Elisha Abbey, and Ephraim Montague. About 1700 persons have been\
        \ members of the church since it was founded. The present membership is 277\

        \ 1867, but declined. On Aug. 21, 1867, Rev. D. Donavan, a graduate of the\
        \ University of Vermont, and of Newton Theological Seminary, was called, and\
        \ became the pastor of the church. He remained less than two years, and was\

        \ June 24, 1795. The original members were sixteen in number, includ ing seven\
        \ females. For a quarter of a century a considerable portion of its membership\
        \ consisted of persons belonging to the neighboring towns. The church then\
        \ employed supplies until the ordination of Rev. Wm. R. Warner, in August,\
        \ 1872, who became the next pastor. He withdrew in August, 1873, and was succeeded\
        \ in November of the same year by Rev. Mr. Battell, whose pas torate was terminated\
        \ in March, 1875. In May, 1875, Rev. Philip Barry commenced preaching, and\
        \ was installed in July following. He remained until April, 1877. Rev. Samuel\
        \ Bigelow, one of the original members, is sup posed to have been principally\
        \ instrumental in gathering the church. He performed pastoral services, more\
        \ or less, for ten or twelve years. During this time the number of members\
        \ gradually increased. The present pastor, Rev. B. F. Tuck, commenced his\
        \ labors July 1, 1877. The deacons of the church are Abraham Wis ton, aged\
        \ ninety, Henry Graves, and Daniel Sawin. In 1806 serious difficulties arose\
        \ which threatened the con tinued existence of the church. A council was called\
        \ for their adjustment in 1808, and was happily successful. A revival followed,\
        \ in which from 70 to 80 persons were admitted to the church by baptism. The\
        \ ministry of Rev. David Pease com menced about this time. He was ordained\
        \ pastor of the church June 10, 1810. Hitherto, the church for want of better\

        \ thus showing that with him the closing pas sage of \"Thanatopsis\" rested,\
        \ as it must rest, upon the solid and everlasting foundations of Christian\
        \ faith. Near the close of his residence here in the summer of 1877, and on\
        \ the last Sab bath he ever spent in Cummington, he came to this church with\
        \ his daughter. The pastor was absent, and no supply for the pulpit arranged.\
        \ After waiting some time, Mr. Bryant arose and said that it was evident they\
        \ were to have no min ister ; that if the people wished he would read selections\
        \ from the Bible. Then, going to the desk, he opened the sacred vol ume and\
        \ read for some time in his own inimitable manner. Then, in devout, childlike\
        \ simplicity, he closed by reciting the Lord's Prayer. To many of that audience\
        \ this is the last personal reminiscence of the great poet, as he soon after\
        \ left town never to return ; for in the opening months of the next summer,\
        \ amid the roses of June he loved so well, he passed away \" like one who\

        \ of the lots neatly terraced, showing evidence of loving care. There is another\
        \ small, but still a public, burial-place near Francis Streeter's. At West\
        \ Cummington is a cemetery in which general burial occurs for that place and\
        \ vicinity. Besides these public grounds, there are private fam ily burial-places\

        \ fifteen or twenty years before the Morgan excitement, when it died out.\
        \ It was known as Orion Lodge. The place of meeting was in the hall over the\

        \ Before the organization of a society, and perhaps as early as 1835, occasional\
        \ meetings were held, and Rev. William Wilcox, a minister of this denomination,\
        \ preached in the school-house at West Cummington. Receiving considerable\
        \ encouragement, a society was formed and regular services es tablished. A\
        \ council of the Universalist churches was held here in 1839, and is remembered\
        \ by many as an occasion of great interest. The house of worship was built\
        \ in 1845 or 1846, by Zebedee Randall, contractor ; probably cost about \xA7\
        2000. The land for the site was given by Charles Shaw. The house is conveniently\
        \ situated on the main street, and has one of the old-time spires, which have\
        \ scarcely been suc ceeded by anything more appropriate in modern church archi\
        \ tecture. It needs some repairs and improvements at the pres ent time, but\
        \ is otherwise a handsome edifice. Services were maintained with considerable\
        \ regularity for twenty years or more. The ministers were Rev. Almond Mason,\
        \ Rev. Earl Guilford, Rev. Moses Stoddard, Rev. Mr. Giftbrd, Rev. Mr. Plumb,\
        \ Rev. Mr. Hughes, Rev. Mr. Mandel, Rev. L. W. Brigham, and Rev. Mr. Trask.\
        \ The latter was the last reg ular minister. Since he closed his labors there\
        \ have been only occasional speakers. Temperance societies and several benevolent\
        \ or literary as sociations have existed from time to time, but quickly dis\
        \ solved. There was an early temperance movement about 1830. Lawyer Holland,\
        \ of Belchertown, came out and deliv ered an address in the old church on\
        \ the Hill, and a society was formed. The hall over Mr. Kingman's store was\
        \ exten sively used from 1820 to 1835. Singing-schools met there, courts and\
        \ arbitrations, religious meetings, and miscellaneous gatherings. The Bryant\
        \ Library was founded by the poet for the benefit of his native town in 1872.\
        \ He devoted something like \xA720,000 to this purpose, about half of which\
        \ is invested in buildings and grounds, comprising the library itself and\
        \ a dwelling- house for the librarian and his family. The collection of books\
        \ is very valuable, embracing a great variety of subjects, and particularly\
        \ rich in the historical department. It is open for consultation and circulation.\
        \ Mr. Lorenzo N. Tower is the present librarian (1878). The town is required,\
        \ by the conditions of the gift, to make a small annual appropriation 'for\

        \ were Eben ezer Shaw, Brackley Shaw, Spencer Shaw, Charles Shaw, Jacob Bates,\
        \ William Thompson, and Andrew Babbitt. The society still retains its legal\
        \ organization and its property. The present clerk is Horatio Jordan, and\

        \ was born in New buryport, Mass., March 9, 1803, and was the son of Nathaniel\
        \ and Elizabeth Cutts Carter. His mother was a granddaughter of Edward Holyoke,\
        \ D.D., a former president of Harvard College. His father was a prominent\
        \ merchant and importer of Newburyport previous to the great fire of 1811,\
        \ by which, and by losses at sea, and by the French spoliations about the\
        \ same time, he was reduced from wealth to a small competence. This was an\
        \ important crisis to young Car ter, and forced him to forego his hopes of\
        \ a higher and casier walk in life and adopt one of toil. To the end that\
        \ he might do BO profit ably as well as honorably he chose to learn a trails,\
        \ and for this pur pose entered the establishment of Jonathan Lcavitt, of\
        \ Andorer, Mass., where he undertook a regular course of instruction in book\
        \ binding. Serving five years as an apprentice, he arrived at man hood independent\
        \ of the chances of trade or fortune so far as the means to secure an honest\
        \ livelihood were coucernod. Before going to Andover he was engaged in the\
        \ book-store of Charles Whipple, in his native town, and in the extensive\
        \ publishing house of Welli A Lilley, Boston. Book-making seems to have been\
        \ his natural calling. for he was engaged in some department of that pursuit\
        \ from the time he commenced until his retirement from ac tire business. Iu\
        \ September, 1825, .Mr. Carter settled in Ambcrtt, end at onoe entered into\
        \ partnership with Mr. John S. Adams, under the firm mime of Carter <fc Adams,\
        \ and established a book-store, printing-office, and bindery. The first volume\
        \ published was an octavo of some three hundred and fifty pages of sermons,\
        \ by Rev. Daniel A. Clark, a former pastor of the First Congregational Church.\
        \ This work was followed by several volumes of Scott's novels (Waverlcy) for\
        \ a Boston firm* In June, 1826, they commenced the publication of an octavo\
        \ called The Chemist, with Prof. John R. Cotting as editor. In December, 1826,\
        \ they started the first newspaper in Amherst, tho New England Inquirer, with\
        \ Hon. Osmyn Baker as editor. In 1827, Mr. Carter dissolved his partnership\
        \ with Mr. Adams. During this year he organized an engine company in Amherst,\
        \ being mainly instrumental in raising the money for the purchase of the engine.\
        \ He was connected with the company for more than twenty years, and was foreman\
        \ for a long time. In 1828 he was chosen librarian and treasurer of the Amherst\
        \ Lyceum, also secretary and treasurer of the West Amherst Temperance Union,\
        \ which offices he hold twelve years. It was while in his position in the\
        \ temperance society that he was instructed to collect statistics touching\
        \ upon intemperance in the vicinity of the society. The care bestowed upon\
        \ tho work, as exhibited in the extract we give from the records, is but a\
        \ sample of the thoroughness with which he did everything intrusted to him.\
        \ The record says that during the year 1 827 eighty hogsheads of ardent .-<pirits\
        \ were sold, besides what was retailed in six taverns, making a fair estimate\
        \ of one hundred hogsheads sold during the year, besides about two hundred\
        \ barrels of eider. It was reported that there were forty-eight drunkards\
        \ in town, and twenty-three widows who were made so by rum. Deaths forty-five,\
        \ one-ninth of which were directly traceable to intemperance. Three-fourths\
        \ of the pauperism wire also traced to the same cause. Five crimes were committed,\
        \ and five licenses to sell liquors were issued. On tho first night of meeting\
        \ only ten names were obtained, but in eight years no loss than nine hundred\
        \ and seventy-three names were added, a largo majority of whom remained faithful.\
        \ / V1 school, and for nearly fifty years has been directly connected with\
        \ that school, cither as scholar, librarian, teacher, or superintendent, a\
        \ fact which speaks more for him than could columns from our pen. His connection\
        \ with the church and the parish is quite as remarkable, he having held the\
        \ positions of clerk and treasurer, and served as one of the parish committee.\
        \ He is now one of the trustees and also treas urer of the parish -inking\
        \ fund. By referring to the town records we find how honorable has been his\
        \ connection with the affairs of the village. In 1837\u201439 ho was one of\
        \ the prudential school committee. In 1*7'.7 he was appointed town agent to\
        \ receive and loan all the money received from surplus revenue of the United\
        \ States. In 1841 and 1812 he was representative to the General Court, and\
        \ herj again he made his mark, being one of the committee to draft what is\
        \ now known as the registration law. This selection was a fitting recogni\
        \ tion of his ability, and mado in consideration of the fact that for three\
        \ years before he had made the registration of births, marriages, and deaths\
        \ a matter of investigation. Finally, in connection with Judge G. F. Bigclow,\
        \ he secured tho passage of the law above referred to. Of its inestimable\
        \ value to our town and city records there can be no possible doubt, and its\
        \ authorship is an honor ho may proudly wear. In is ii he was appointed postmaster,\
        \ and held the office nine years. There are many who remember distinctly the\
        \ outburst of feeling caused by his removal, coming as it did from men of\
        \ all parties, his gentlemanly bearing ami courteous manner having won to\
        \ his defense many who differed from him in politics. Mr. Carter's contributions\
        \ to tho press have been frequent and valuable, his statistics on educa tional\
        \ and farm matters being standard authority. But his greatest work has been\
        \ in the position of town clerk and treasurer, which office ho has filled\
        \ for thirty-two years, during which time he has re ceived and disbursed $1,300,000.\
        \ He has kept statistics of the schools that are interesting, and as zealously\
        \ guarded their welfare andsuccess as it was possible for man to do. Another\
        \ work to which he has de voted over a Year's time was the preparation of\
        \ the descriptive li-t of the soldiers of Amherst in \"the late war. It is\
        \ sufficient to say that it is perfect, every man's name, age, occupation,\
        \ date of enlistment, battles in which he or his regiment or company was engaged,\
        \ pro motion, and final \"muster out\" or other discharge, being accurately\
        \ arranged, the whole in alphabetical order. It is a work for easy reference\
        \ in all time to come, and he deserves the highest praise for his labors and\
        \ untiring research. Nor did his work for the soldiers end there. His pleasant\
        \ face and kindly word, as he min istered to the widows and orphans of those\
        \ who \"sleep the sleep of the bravo,\" made the small amount he was commissioned\
        \ to deal out to each scorn tho more that it was delivered by a cheerful giver.\
        \ In 1865 the Amherst Savings-Bank was organized, and Mr. tarter be came its\
        \ treasurer, which office ho still holds, discharging this as well as all\
        \ other trusts with the same unvarying fidelity. Mr. Carter was married iu\
        \ 1826 to Miss Matilda Aycrs, of Havorhill, and after her decease to Miss\
        \ Elizabeth D. Jackson, of Boston, in 1835. Mr. Carter s fivo children all\
        \ died in their infancy or early youth. Although in the seventy-seventh year\
        \ of his ago, his step is as firm and quick as most men at fifty, and\" his\
        \ appearance indicates that he may be spared many years. It is perhaps needless\
        \ to say that he owes his long life and perfect health to his strictly temperate\
        \ habits. He never used .toUaeco or spirits in any form. It is safe to say\
        \ that no man in Ain- Wt is more honored or respected, or would be missed\

        \ was laid May 20, 1872, and the church dedicated Nov. 17, 1872. It is a handsome\

        \ one of the largest and hand somest places of burial in Western Massachusetts.\
        \ It com prises 25 acres of land, situated in the northwest part of Ware village,\
        \ and was presented to the town in the year 1853, by 11. .h. Orrin Sagp\\\

        \ Of these the oldest is what is known as the \"old burying-ground,\" which\
        \ is situated about half a mile from the village, on the Palmer road. It was\
        \ probably first occupied soon after the settlement of the town. No burials\
        \ have taken place in it since 1826. It is now cov ered by a forest of small\
        \ pine-trees, but is kept in good con dition. Most of its graves have sunk\
        \ out of sight, and arc not marked by tombstones. Of these but eight are standing,\
        \ the oldest being that of Miss Sally, daughter of Samuel and Anna Dinsmore,\
        \ who died Feb. 13, 1786, in her eighteenth year. The sixth is the Catholic\
        \ cemetery, which adjoins St. Wil liam's Catholic Church and contains a great\
        \ many graves. It was laid out in the year 1850. NOTES FROM THE RECORDS. A\
        \ few notes from the records will best illustrate the usages and customs of\
        \ the past and the manner of conducting town business. In Ware, as in many\
        \ other towns in the common wealth, it was the custom, instead of hailing\
        \ all new-comers as welcome accessions to the strength of the community, to\
        \ warn them to depart, lest they should become a charge to the town. In March,\
        \ 1765, the town allowed William Bell 12 shillings for warning out several\
        \ and carrying out some. In 1790 the constable was directed to warn 51 persons,\
        \ whose names were given, to depart from the limits of the town, with their\
        \ children, and all under them, within fifteen days. The next burial-places\
        \ in point of age are those at Ware Centre, \u2014 one standing near the church,\
        \ and the other a few rods farther off. The first was laid < > 1 1 1 M.p.n\
        \ after the incor poration of the town, and has been in use ever since. Among\

        \ a successor to Mr. Mather, mentioned Mr. Stoddard as better qualified than\
        \ any other within his knowledge. 3Ir. Stoddard had de termined to go to England,\
        \ had engaged his passage, put his baggage on board the vessel, and was expecting\
        \ to sail the next day, when the town committee applied to him. Owing to the\

        \ his voyage and go to Northampton . The labors of 3Ir. 3Iather were abundantly\
        \ rewarded, and man}r names were added to the church. He was not only a very\
        \ zealous preacher, but a most exemplary man. Just pre vious to his death\
        \ he preached several sermons having special reference to the spiritual interests\
        \ of the rising generation, which were published in 1671. 3Ir. 3Iather married\

        \ married Rev. John Williams, of Deerfield, and was killed by the Indians\

        \ to the cove nant adopted by the church at its organization, not all of those\
        \ persons were in full communion. The church records at the time of the death\
        \ of 3Ir. 3Iather contain the names of but 76 persons who are classed as full\

        \ Sir. Stoddard was a man of great learning and piety, and probably possessed\
        \ more influence than any clergyman in the province during a period of thirty\
        \ years. Timothy Dwight, president of Yale College, a native of Northampton,\
        \ who trav eled through New England in 1796, says of him, in a series of letters\
        \ afterward published : \" The very savages are said to have felt toward him\
        \ a peculiar awe. Once when he was riding from Northampton to Hatfield, and\
        \ passing a place called Dewey 's Hole, an ambush of savages lined the road.\
        \ It is said that a Frenchman, directing his gun toward him, was warned by\
        \ one of the Indians, who some time before had been among the English, not\
        \ to fire, because 'that was the English man's God.' A similar adventure is\
        \ reported to have befallen him while meditating, in an orchard immediately\
        \ behind the church in Deerfield, a sermon which he was about to preach. These\
        \ stories, told in Canada, are traditionally asserted to have been brought\
        \ back by English captives.\" Mr. 3Iather died July 24, 1669, at the age of\
        \ thirty-two, having been a resident of the town about eleven years. Dur ing\
        \ the last years of his life he suffered from ill health, proba bly to an\
        \ extent that interfered with his pastoral duties, for in 3Iarch, 1669, the\
        \ town passed a vote inviting his successor. During his long pastorate of\
        \ fifty-seven years, Mr. Stoddard enjoyed the respect, confidence, and love\
        \ of his people. Hav ing reached an advanced age, and finding himself inadequate\
        \ tip discharge the whole duty of a minister, he requested the as sistance\
        \ of a colleague, and iii 1727 hi- grandson, Jonathan Edwards, was associated\
        \ with him in the pastoral office. He lived two years after this event, and\
        \ died, Feb. 11, 1729, aged eighty-six. He married Esther, widow of his predecessor,\
        \ Rev. Eleazer 31athcr. She died in 1736, aged ninety-two. One of their -phis,\
        \ Anthony, was graduated at Harvard College, and was minister of Woodbury,\
        \ Conn. Another son, John, well known in town affairs as Col. John Stoddard,\
        \ became eminent as a civilian, and possessed great influence throughout the\
        \ province. Settlement of the Second Minister. \u2014 The second minister\
        \ settled over the church in Northampton was Bev. Solomon Stoddard. At a meeting\
        \ held 3sarch 4, 1669, the town voted unanimously to give him a call. He was\
        \ offered \xA310(1 per year, \xA3100 for building a house, and within five\
        \ or six years twenty acres of land \" within our fenced field, fit for plowing\
        \ and mowing.\" 3Ir. Stoddard responded favorably, and com menced preaching\
        \ the same year, but did not at once accept the terms offered, for the next\
        \ year a committee of nine per sons was \" empowered to act in all matters\
        \ in reference to the settlement of Rev. Solomon Stoddard.\" They determined\
        \ to offer him \xA3100 worth of meadow-land, \xA3100 a year \" for his maintenance,\"\
        \ \xA3100 to build a house in two or three years, and the use of \xA3100 worth\
        \ of the sequestered land till it is paid, and also \" a home-lot of four\
        \ acres if he pleases.\" These terms were on condition \" 3Ir. Stoddard doth\
        \ settle and abide amongst us.\" A satisfactory arrangement based on these\
        \ conditions was made, though the installation did not take place till two\
        \ years after. The church record of his ordination is as follows : A spirited\
        \ controversy concerning qualifications for church membership sprang up between\
        \ Mr. Stoddard and Dr. In crease Mather, of Boston, in the year 1700. At that\
        \ time many of the churches throughout the province regarded the sacrament\
        \ of the Lord's Supper as a converting ordinance, and believed that all baptized\
        \ persons, not scandalous in life, might lawfully approach the table, though\
        \ they knew them selves to be destitute of true religion. This belief and\
        \ prac tice Dr. Mather assailed in a sermon, \" The Order of the Gos pel,\"\
        \ published iii 1700. To this 3Ir. Stoddard replied in an earnest and convincing\
        \ manner. The controversy was re sumed in 1708 and 1709, and prosecuted on\
        \ both sides with vigor and ability. A few years later this same conflict\
        \ of opinion became the ostensible reason for the dismission of his colleague\
        \ and successor, Rev. Jonathan Edwards. The biog raphers of 31r. Edwards assert\
        \ that Mr. Stoddard changed his views on this subject after he had been thirty-two\
        \ years min ister at Northampton. It is charged that without the sanc tion\
        \ of the church he introduced this change, making it the rule of procedure,\
        \ and prepared, in conformity to his own opinions, \" a short profession\"\
        \ for persons to make on admis sion to membership. This is incorrect. The\
        \ vote of the church at the ordination of 31r. Stoddard (quoted above) proves\
        \ that he had no need to change his sentiments. The church be lieved as he\
        \ did when he accepted the pastorate, and it was only to defend his own life-long\
        \ convictions and the thirty two years' practice of his church that he replied\
        \ to Dr. Mather. \"Sept. 11, \\lilz.\u2014 S iI'piii'pii Sloplilard was ordained\

        \ of the water-privi lege at the present site of Haydenville was the erection\
        \ of a saw-mill in 1785, by Samuel Fairfield and John Miller, upon the place\

        \ there in 1824, but was soon after removed. PLACES OF HISTORIC INTEREST OR\
        \ OF SPECIAL NOTE. Several of these appear in the general narrative, and need\

        \ held there, when the messenger with the news of Burgoyne's advancing forces\
        \ burst in upon the morning sermon, forms a point worthy of note. The location\
        \ of John Miller's first log cabin, where he settled all alone in the forest,\
        \ daring all the risks of savage attack and welcoming the howl of wild animals,\
        \ will always have a special interest to the student of pioneer life. The\
        \ Delevan place, Capt. Fair field's ancient tavern, and the place of the old\
        \ historic oak must enter into this catalogue; and many other places with\
        \ similar associations will occur to those who read the annals of the town.\
        \ Finally, the broken reservoir and the scarred channel below will, for generations\
        \ to come, be pointed out as the scene of the most terrific disaster of modern\
        \ times. A grist-mill, the first and only one ever operated in Hayden ville,\
        \ was erected about 1800, by Lieut. Joshua Thayer, and stood near the old\
        \ Cornelius Tileston place. Soon after this mill was built, a freshet swept\
        \ away the dam and turned the mill partly over. The current of the river was\
        \ turned into the highway, and completely took possession of it as far down\
        \ as the dugway hill. A large hole was made in the road, in front of the mill,\
        \ and the public travel was compelled to pass around it for several years.\
        \ The hole was finally filled, but it was distinguishable for many years.\
        \ The dam was never rebuilt ; all traces of the mill were swept away, and\
        \ thus ended the brief history of the grist-mill of Haydenville. In 1837,\
        \ Esdras F. Fairfield and Cyrus Miller built a saw mill nearly opposite the\
        \ thread-factory of later years. Its water-power was lost by the construction\
        \ of the dam for the cotton-factory, and the mill itself was burned in 1847.\
        \ INDUSTRIAL PURSUITS. The occupation of early times was chiefly agriculture.\
        \ The extensive and valuable forests gave rise t<> a large amount of wood\
        \ and lumber business. Charcoal was burned to some ex tent for market. All\
        \ the crops usual to these hill towns were raised. The soil was productive,\
        \ and yielded fair returns for the labor of the pioneers. The mountain slopes\
        \ afforded ex cellent pasturage for the fattening of beef and the success\
        \ of the dairy. In later times, of course, the mills and factories absorbed\
        \ general attention. When the business of manufac turing prospered, the farmers\
        \ prospered ; mechanics had abun dant employment, and merchants made quick\
        \ and profitable sales. When manufactures diminished, all other departments\
        \ of business were embarrassed. Hence the disaster of 1874 was a blow to all.\
        \ In the place of wealth there came to many poverty. In the place of business\
        \ activity came stagnation, paralysis. In the place of abundant facilities,\
        \ demolished factories, ruined machinery, and crippled resources. The danger\
        \ of living near the banks of the streams, together with the hard times, reduced\
        \ the value of homesteads. There were many to sell and few to buy. With a\
        \ third of the business The foundry was probably established as early as 1824.\
        \ David Hyde, George W. Holmes, Wm. Lewis, Lyman Litch field, Josiah Hayden,\

        \ about 1839, in the building used by his predecessors, where the pen-factory\
        \ of later years stood. In 1844 he erected the large buildings east of the\
        \ hotel, and the business afterward passed to Boland & Graves, who continued\
        \ it for many years. The business was not resumed after the flood. The brass\
        \ business was carried on there for a time. The business was run by the Hayden\
        \ Foundry Company for several years. The erection of the first mill for manufacturing\
        \ purposes in Haydenville was commenced in 1809, by Daniel and David Hayden\
        \ (uncles of Joel and Josiah), Seth Thompson, and Melitier Everett, of Foxboro'.\
        \ This mill was of wood, two stories high and 31 feet square. The building\

        This denomination existed for many years in the west part of the town of Hardwick,
        at first as the Hardwick Baptist Church, and then as the Hardwick and Ware
        Baptist Church. In 1846 the society removed from Hardwick to Ware, and became
        established at the village under the name of the Ware Baptist Church. The
        first pastor was Rev. Amory Gale, a graduate of Brown University, who was
        ordained November 11th of that year. He was dismissed in 1850, and was succeeded
        on August 22d of that year by Rev. J. A. Bullard, of Middletown, O., who was
        dismissed to Troy, N. Y., in April, 1853. Rev. George E. Puller became the
        next pastor soon after the withdrawal of Mr. Bul lard, and died while discharging
        his duties on June 6, 1856. He was succeeded by Rev. J. E. Wiggins, of Lowell,
        Mass., who was ordained Feb. 10, 1857, and dismissed to South Chelmsford,
        Mass., Sept. 19, 1858. Rev. J. P. Jones was the next pastor, and was installed
        Jan. 1, 1859, and remained in that relation until October, 1860, when the
        house of worship, which had been dedicated in the fall of 1847, was destroyed
        by fire. After this disaster but a few meetings were held ; the society vir
        tually dissolved, and now has no active existence. Rev. A. E. P. Perkins,
        D.D., the present pastor, is a native of Royalston, Mass., who graduated at
        Amherst College in 1840. He was for eleven years pastor of the Congregational
        Church at Phillipston, in Worcester County, and was installed over his present
        charge Dec. 5, 1855. The degree of D.D. was conferred upon him by Williams

        average attendance on Sabbath-school, 200 ; volumes in li brary, several hundred
        ; superintendent of Sabbath-school, George G. Hall. This society was organized
        Oct. 7, 1846. Prior to its estab lishment several liberal movements had been
        undertaken in the town without success. In the autumn of 1845 the nucleus
        of the present society was formed, and met in the east brick mill, now owned
        by the Otis Company. Rev. George Chan ning preached the first sermon, and
        regular services were held by him, Rev. Mr. Alden, and others until the approach
        of winter. Meetings were then held in the Water Street chapel of the East
        Congregational Church. In the spring of 1846 a house of worship was begun
        on the spot where the church now stands, and on the 24th of January the basement
        was consecrated and occupied by the vestry. Here the society worshiped until
        the completion of the church in the following summer. METHODIST EPISCOPAL.*
        The Methodist Church in Ware was organized about the year 1826, probably by
        Joshua Crowell, a Methodist local el der, residing at the centre, and Luther
        Payne, a local preacher and class-leader, residing at the village. The earlier
        meet ings were held at private houses, often at Mr. Payne;s, sometimes in
        an unoccupied portion of the mill, and in the school-houses on North Street
        and in the south part of the vil lage. Meetings were also held for a time
        in an upper room in a house opposite to where the church now stands. A meet
        ing-bouse was erected in 1844, under the pastorate of Rev. D. Sherman, D.D.,
        for many years a presiding elder in the Meth odist Episcopal Conference. The
        church was raised and en larged by the addition of vestries, a vestibule,
        and tower in 1848, under the pastorate of Rev. C. L. Eastman, now pastor of
        the "Seaman''s Bethel," Boston. In 1848 the society received from the church
        in Bolton, Mass., the gift of a complete and beautiful communion service,
        which is still in use. The pulpit Bible was presented by the ladies of the
        Springfield Society, and the bell by Thomas Cordis, of Boston. The first regular
        pastor was Rev. George S. Ball, who was ordained Oct. 13, 1847, and resigned,
        because of ill health, July 6, 1849. The next was Rev. George T. Hill, of
        Hub bardton, who was installed Sept. 22, 1852. Rev. S. F. Clarke, of Athol,
        was installed Dec. 24, 1856, and died in the pastoral office March 27, 1861.
        Early in the history of the society they were supplied with preaching frequently
        by local preachers in the vicinity, Mr. Crowell and Mr. Payne often performing
        this service. The first regularly-appointed preacher from the Conference was
        Rev. William P. White, stationed here in 1833. Mr. White''s successors have
        been somewhat numerous, as until recently, by a law of the church, no minister
        could remain a pastor of the same church more than two successive years, and
        later only three years. Prominent among the early preachers were W. P. White,
        Samuel Palmer, James O. Deane, Thomas Marcy, David Sherman, Ichabod Marcy,
        C. L. Eastman, and J. W. Dadmun. From the time of Mr. Clarke''s death until

        \ PRIVATE SCHOOLS. Fourteen years prior to the Revolution \u2014 Jan. 20,\
        \ 1762 \u2014 a portion of the people of Hampshire County memorialized the\
        \ General Court, saying \"that there are a great number of people of this\
        \ county of Hampshire, and places adjacent, dis posed to promote learning,\
        \ and by reason of their great dis tance from the colleges and the great expense\
        \ of their education there, many of good natural genius are prevented a liberal\
        \ education, and a large country filling up at the northwest of them, which\
        \ will send a great number of men of letters.\" '\u2022 They therefore pray\
        \ for an act of the government constitu ting a corporation with power to receive\
        \ monies and improve them for setting up a seminary for learning, and that\
        \ a charter may be granted to the corporation for the said seminary, en dowing\
        \ it with power to manage all the atfairs relative to the same, and confer\
        \ the honors of learning upon the students of tie -.line qualified therefor.\"\
        \ Professor H. C. Nash has a select private school for young men at his residence\
        \ on Mount Pleasant, ninth of Amherst \"centre.\" This residence is the \"\
        central edTfice\" of the onee renowned \" Mount Pleasant Classical Institute,\"\
        \ so famous in the school-days of Henry Ward Beecher, who, with hundreds of\
        \ others, was there prepared for college. The long, low wings, formerly attached\
        \ to the sides of the central building, have disappeared. The Misses Howland\
        \ have a select school of about thirty scholars; and Mrs. E. A. Steams, widow\
        \ of William F. Steams, whose splendid gift of $:',o.ihiii secured to Amherst\
        \ College her finest edifice, \u2014 tie- College Church, \u2014 conducts\
        \ a small select boarding-school for young ladies, al her residence, the \"\
        President's House LIBRARIES. This effort, though meeting with some encouragement\
        \ and the favor of Gov. Bernard,* was bitterly opposed by the au thorities\
        \ of I larva r'l College, who took immediate, earnest steps fpp prevent the\
        \ founding of \"a college or collegiate school in Hampshire County, by charter-from\
        \ home (England) or else where.\" This and kindred opposition, together with\
        \ the pre- Revolutionary agitations which soon followed, defeated the mot\
        \ i nient. The North Amherst Library Association was formed by \xAB - i t\
        \ i \u2014 zens of North Amherst, .March 17, 1869, al a meeting pre sided\
        \ over by George Eastman. The following persons were then chosen an executive\
        \ committee: George E. Atkins, George Eastman, .latins B. Roberts. Subscription^\
        \ wen- at once solicited, and the foundation laid lor the present library\
        \ of 641 volumes. For the first two or three years the number of books did\
        \ not exceed 21MJ. While the people of Western Massachusetts deemed the founding\
        \ of a collegiate institution somewhere within their borders a necessity,\
        \ they were not agreed upon the question of location. Among the competitors\
        \ of Amherst in this mat ter, Northampton seems to have been the most formidable.\
        \ The claim of the former was subsequently strengthened by the action of the\
        \ Franklin County Association of ministers, who, having convened at the house\
        \ of Rev. Theophilus Pack ard, at Shelburne. May 10, 1815, resolved that \"\
        knowledge and virtue might be greatly subserved by a literary institu tion\
        \ situated in that important section of the commonwealth,\" - Hampshire County;\
        \ and further, that Amherst was the \" most eligible place for locating it.\"\
        f Such influential en dorsement, from a foreign source, did much to disarm\
        \ the pp|.|ppp-itiou to a location at Amherst ; but the projectors of the\
        \ college were destined to see another and less ambitious insti tution in\
        \ some measure anticipate their action, and eventually prove the stepping-stone\
        \ to full success. This was the Am herst Academy. It was opened in 1814 and\
        \ dedicated in 1815. Because of \"opposition in Amherst and in the neighboring\
        \ towns,\" arising in part from local differences and religious prejudice,\
        \ the charter was delayed until 1816. Samuel Fowler Dickinson and Hezekiah\
        \ Wright Strong were active agents in establishing the academy, as afterward\
        \ the college. Other Though not at first a free library, it was made such\
        \ in 1876, when it was reorganized in conformity with tin- statute which requires\
        \ that all libraries receiving aid from the town -ball be free to \"all the\
        \ inhabitants thereof. \" The following officers were chosen by the new organization,\
        \ and >iill continue to serve in their several capacities, having been each\
        \ year re elected: President, Harrison Ingram; \\'ie.-l're-ii].ni . Almon\
        \ E. Cowles; Director-, Harrison Ingram. George K. Atkins, Henry YV. Ha-kin-\
        \ ; Treasurer, Clerk, and Librarian. Forrester P. Ainsworth. The library receives\
        \ annually $100 from the town. The Amherst Free Library originated in a book\
        \ club, formed in 1872, whose members contributed their individual private\
        \ collections, or parts thereof, as a nucleus for a library. In tie spring\
        \ of 1873, at a meeting convened at the house of Dr. H. J. Cate, one of the\
        \ originators of the club, a three days fair was determined upon, who-p- proceed.-\
        \ -hotild, with whatever subscriptions could be obtained, form a book fund.\
        \ The fair, which was held in the following October, netted J640. A meeting\
        \ was then called and the present association formed, in which the annual\
        \ membership fee was fixed al $6, and life mernbershipsat $25. A small association\
        \ at East Amherst, pos sessing about 200 volunteers, wa- absorbed by the new\
        \ organ ization, and its members admitted without payment of the regular fee.\
        \ The library then contained, including recenl purchases, about 750 books.\
        \ The association was further strengthened by a stipulation on the part of\
        \ twenty individ uals to give yearly $5 each for five years. In addition,\

        \ those of Adams, Lowell, Mather, Otis, Prescott, Saltonstall, Warren, and\
        \ Winthrop may be mentioned as having not only a local, but a national, reputation.\
        \ Among individuals who were conspicuous in Boston in their day and earned\
        \ a fame which outlasts their generation, such men as Increase Mather, James\
        \ Bow doin, John Hancock, John Quincy Adams, William Ellery Channing, and\
        \ Charles Sumner come at once to mind, all of whom are identified with the\
        \ history of Harvard by the love they bore her and the services they rendered\
        \ her. The prevailing intellectual tone or temper of the university, like\
        \ that of the town of Boston, has always been free. The university is hospitable\
        \ to all religious and political opinions ; but its inclination, and that\
        \ of a majority of its graduates, from the earliest times, has uniformly been\
        \ towards the side of liberty in Church and State. The particular manifestation\
        \ of this inclina tion has changed from generation to generation, but the\
        \ tendency has been constant and plain to be seen. While cherished and honored\
        \ by the State, Harvard University has been, from the first, a private, incorporated\
        \ institution, supported, in the main, first by the fees paid by its students,\
        \ and secondly by the income of permanent funds given by benevolent individuals.\
        \ At present (1879) tne va'ue of its lands, buildings, collections, and invested\
        \ funds is roughly estimated at $6,000,000. In the year ending Sept. 1, 1877,\
        \ its receipts from students for instruction were $204,319.44, its total income\
        \ being $544,878.17. It has 125 teachers (of whom 52 are professors), besides\
        \ 26 librarians, proctors, and other officers. It counts 1,344 students, of\
        \ whom 980 are pursuing liberal studies, and 464 professional. The government\
        \ of Harvard University may be briefly described as follows : The legal title\
        \ of the corporation is the \" President and Fellows of Harvard College.\"\
        \ The corporation, \u2014 consisting of the president, fel lows (five in number),\
        \ and treasurer, \u2014 and the board of overseers (thirty two in number),\
        \ are the governing powers of the whole university, which comprehends the\
        \ following departments : Harvard College, the Divinity School, the Law School,\
        \ the Medical School, the Dental School, the Law rence Scientific School,\

        day to thorough and sys tematic study. To carry out this purpose, courses
        of reading and plans of work are arranged, and thorough directions and advice
        are given ; and finally an annual meeting is held, where the students can

        officers are : Peter Gratz, President ; Carl Wehrstedt, Vice President ; Henry
        Behr, Secre tary ; George H. Mueller, Financial Secretary, and Jacob Jacoby,
        Treasurer ; H.P. Seibel is Musical Director, and Arnold Rigger is Librarian.
        Prof. H. Von Eisner, who died in July, 1878, was, for some time, musical director,
        and is spoken of by the mem bers as having been a fine musician, to whom thc
        society is under obligations for quite a large portion of its present efficiency.
        OUR HIGHEST OFFICIALS. Bloomington was not very ambitious for high political
        honors in its younger days. It never aspired to fill high offices in the State
        or nation ; was content to be well governed at home, and to take care of as
        many of the county and legislative offices as possible) ever ready to help
        elect good men from other portions of the State to its highest offices. Even
        when John Moore, of Randolph''s Grove, was made Lieutenant Governor in 1840,
        it did not seem to rouse our other politicians to any degree of individual
        ambition. There was a spasm at the time Owen Lovejoy was nominated for Congress
        in 1856, McLean being then in the same district with Bureau County, but nothing
        came of it, and our voters swallowed their pride, and assisted Mr. Lovejoy
        to the position he desired. Up to 1870, no citizen of McLean County had ever
        been elected to Congress. In 1856, James Miller, of Bloomington, was chosen
        State Treasurer, being the first Bloomingtonian to fill a high State office.
        Mr. Miller was one of our most respected citizens, and has left his mark upon
        our city, very particularly in the Methodist Church, of which he was a consistent,
        liberal and enthusiastic member. In 1874, Samuel M. Etter, who had for some
        time been City School Superintendent here, was elected State Superintendent
        of Public Instruction. In 1872, Gen. John McNulta, whose brilliant record
        as Colonel of the Ninety fourth Illinois Regiment is set forth in its proper
        place, was elected to Congress from the district composed of the counties
        of McLean, DeWitt, Logan, Tazewell and Mason, being the first of our citizens
        ever elected to Congress. He was followed in 1874 by A. E. Stevenson, who
        is our present member, having been again elected in November, 1878. Judge
        Thomas F. Tipton, another Bloomingtonian, was chosen to Congress in 1876.
        Our city is now rather noted for its willingness to furnish Congressmen, or,
        in fact, candidates for almost any position. We believe Bloomington has always
        had the Judge of this judicial district ever since it was first filled by
        David Davis in 1848. He was succeeded in 1862 by John M. Scott, who was promoted
        from the Circuit to the Supreme Bench in 1870. Thomas F. Tipton was our Judge
        from the latter date until he was sent to Washington, as noted before, and
        Owen T. Reeves was then chosen to fill the vacancy. Our judges have been distinguished
        for their ability and impartiality.', 1]

        it has proved a complete success. The object is to enable laboring men to
        own their own homes for just about what they would otherwise pay for rent.
        So far, about forty have been assisted to get homes. The charter is limited
        to eight years. The Le Roy Library and Reading Association was organized in
        May, 1875i by Dr. T. D. Fisher, C. A. Barley and C. M. Davis. The capital
        stock is $5 a share. There were eight to commence with. Subscriptions to the
        capital stock could be paid in books. Mrs. N. T. Humphrey, President; Dr.
        Fisher, Vice President; G. L. Sheldon, Secretary; Mrs. T. A. Taylor, Librarian.
        There are 700 volumes. Loan tickets are $2 per year, or 75 cents per quarter.
        Stock holders pay, $100 per year. The affairs of the Association are under
        the management of an Executive Committee. Mrs. Taylor has been Librarian from
        the beginning. From her last report it appears 1 ,500 books had been taken
        out during the year. While yet in its infancy, no one can estimate the influence
        of this in the present, or on the future. There are already many valuable
        books upon its shelves. We notice sets of" Chambers'' Miscellany," Rollins''
        and Macauley''s histories, Wilson''s " Rise and Fall ofthe Slave Power," "Plutarch''s
        Lives," and many of the standard works of travel, history, fiction and poetry.
        The citizens can well afford to give it a wider influence. The Havana, Rantoul
        & Eastern Railroad is, or at least the recently built section from Fisher
        to Le Roy is, a Le Roy enterprise, and its history belongs here. March 24,
        1876, the company was organized here to build a narrow-gauge road from Fisher
        to Le Roy, an extension ofthe road already built from Rantoul to Fisher. James
        Bishop was elected President, C. A. Barley, Secretary, and J. Keenan, Treas
        urer. This action was taken because the people of Empire Township, which had
        donated $75,000 to the I., B. & W. R. R., felt that they had been discriminated
        against in the matter of freights, and they had assurances that if this road
        was built, their grain could be shipped off at less freight than they were
        paying. Fifteen thousand dollars was subscribed to the stock, when the death
        of Mr. Bishop put a stop to the matter for awhile. In the spring of 1868,
        B. J. Gifford, of Rantoul, was elected President, the capital stock was increased
        to $30,000, the right of way was mostly donated, and in ten months from his
        election, the road was built and in running order. Two-thirds of this stock
        was subscribed in Empire Township, cre ating no debt. The road thus built
        is twenty-three miles long, and has eight stations on it. It has already met
        all expectations, freights are lower than ever before, and the road is doing
        a good business. It has good Eastern connections, and will, probably, in time,
        be continued west to Havana. The successive Postmasters of Le Roy have been

        in 1853, and remained under town organi zation until the spring of 1874, when
        the fire which burned out the corner opposite the Le Roy House, burned up
        the town records. In this fire, two stores, Sill''s drug store, a hotel, ten-pin
        alley, Dr. Fisher''s office and two other wooden buildings were destroyed.
        A petition was presented to the Board to permit a city organization. A census
        was taken, which showed a population of 1,018.', 2]

        the first six or eight years. The first officers were : President, Mrs. S.
        B. Brown ; Vice President, Miss A. Warriner; Secretary, Miss Caldwell ; Corresponding
        Secretary, Miss H. Parsons ; Treasurer, Miss Rebecca A. Rogers ; Librarian,
        Miss Hannah M. Snow. The first Board of Managers was composed of the following
        ladies : Mrs. D. Davis, Mrs. F. N. Ewing, Mrs. T. Pardee. Mrs. H. Spencer
        and Mrs. W. H. Allin. On the 28th of February, 1857, the Library was opened
        in a room on Center street. At the next meeting, Judge Davis offered a room
        on Main street free of rent, which offer was very thankfully accepted. The
        Library remained in this room for six or seven years, rent free, and, during
        all this time, it was taken care of and fostered by the ladies with a zeal
        and enthusiasm that gained it a high position among the worthy institutions
        of Bloomington. Its growth was gradual but sure. The catalogue from the beginning
        has always exhibited a large selection of valuable books, and it, has been
        one of the educational institutions of our city. In the year 1867, it was
        thought best to organize under an act of the Legislature, which was obtained
        February 23, 1867. The Library changed its name to the " Bloom ington Library
        Association," and gentlemen were made eligible to office, but its main features
        were unchanged. By the act of incorporation, the Association is able to own
        real estate, manage an endowment fund, to go onward and forward in tbe good
        cause. and take such rank and position as the public or its wealth}'' members
        may in the future see fit to award. Probably the time will come when this
        Association will possess a per manent building of its own, and an endowment
        fund which will render it self-sustaining. The first officers under the new
        organization were elected March 2, 1867. David Davis was President ; E. M.
        Prince, Vice President ; Sarah D. Robinson, Recording Secretary: W. H. Stennett,
        Corresponding Secretary, and W. M. Hatch, Treasurer. The Board of Managers
        were composed of ladies and gentlemen as follows : Mrs. Maria Everly, B. F.
        Hoopes, I. J. Bloomfield and Mrs. J. A. Jackman. The Trustees were John Magoun,
        George W. Parke and John M. Scott. The Library has always been one of Bloomington''s
        favorite institutions, and it has now become very valuable. The last report
        of the Librarian, presented at the annual meeting on the 1st day of March,
        1879, shows that there are in the Library 7,464 volumes. During the year,
        books were used equal to taking out 26,000 different volumes. The Reading-room
        has been well patronized, giving the public access to about 150 periodicals.
        This evidences the great value of the Library aud Reading-room, and its managers
        should go forward in the good work, trusting to the future for further additions
        and the permanent endow ment so earnestly desired. The present officers are:
        Dr. C. R. Parke, President; Dr. H. Conkling, Vice President; B. F. Hoopes,
        Treasurer; Charles L. Capen, Corre sponding Secretary; Lewis E. Ijanis, Recording

        \ fire department previous to 1 828 is obscure; indeed, it is not probable\
        \ that there was a regular or volunteer force, the extinguishment of fires\
        \ at that period, half a century ago, devolving upon the hastily-assembled\
        \ citizens, who, with pails and buckets, in guerrilla fashion, fought the\
        \ flames, and frequently succeeded in overcoming them. This mode continued\
        \ until 1830, when the first regular fire company was organized, consisting\
        \ of thirty of the most prominent citizens, among the number being John Arnot,\
        \ Sr., Miles Covell, S. L. Gillett, David H. Tuthill, Isaac Roe, William Foster,\
        \ William Vial], John Gregg, and B. Satterlee. Of these Mr. Gillett alone\
        \ survives. The first fire-wardens, in 1830, were Miles Covell, John Arnot,\
        \ Jr., and Abraham Ricker. In May, 1834, the first engine (a hand one) was\
        \ purchased for $250. Hooks and ladders were purchased at the same time. This\
        \ engine was known by the appropriate name of \" Old Gooseneck,\" and was\
        \ in active service many years, and the hero of many contests with rival companies,\
        \ as well as against a common enemy. in 1854, No. 1 was reorganized, with\
        \ N. W. Gardiner as foreman. In the same year Eureka Engine Company, No. 5,\
        \ was organized and stationed across the river, near the south end of Lake\
        \ Street bridge. Among its members were George H. Cotton, F. B. Plimpton,\
        \ G. A. Gridley, and E. H. Palmer. In 1856, Rescue Hook-and-Ladder Company,\
        \ No. 6, was organized. In 1858, Eureka Com pany was disbanded, also Red Rover,\
        \ No. 3, owing to dis satisfaction over the election of officers. There was\
        \ a gen eral break-up afterwards, No. 2 disbanding in August of the same year,\
        \ and Torrent, No. 1, in January, 1859. In May, 1858, \" Citizen Engine Company,\
        \ No. 5,\" was reor ganized, and July 17, 1859, Nos. 1 and 2 reorganized.\
        \ Young America, No. 4, disbanded in May, 1860, and Oct. 8, 1860, No. 2 again\
        \ disbanded, but was reorganized in November of that year by Burr Hendrick\
        \ and thirty other young men. In 1863, owing to the refusal of the tax payers\

        \ about Ithaca nearly sixty years ago. The Genesee Conference, in 1821, resolved\
        \ to establish within its bounds \" a university for the education of youth\
        \ of both sexes.\" The go-ahead business men of Ithaca at once took steps\
        \ to secure the location at that place. The hamlet had lately arisen to the\
        \ dignity of an incorporated village, and before even its academy was chartered,\

        \ The existence of Cornell University, by far the most important of the institutions\
        \ of the town, is due to the combined bounty of the United States Government\
        \ and of Ezra Cornell. On the 2d of July, 1862, Congress passed an act grant\
        \ ing to the several States and Territories which should pro vide schools\
        \ for the promotion of agriculture and the me chanic arts thirty thousand\
        \ acres of public lands for each of its senators and representatives in Congress.\
        \ The share of the State of New York amounted to nine hundred and ninety thousand\
        \ acres, and was represented by land-scrip. An address to the public appeared\
        \ in the Journal of May 30, 1821, setting forth all the facts, and appealing\
        \ for gen erous subscriptions to the needed fund. The address in closing says,\
        \ \" Our females may here acquire a useful and solid, as well as finished\
        \ and polite, education ; and our young men will have all the advantages that\
        \ a college can afford.\" The address is signed by Charles Humphrey, Luther\
        \ Gere, C. P. Heermans, Archer Green, and Augustus Sherrill, committee on\
        \ behalf of the citizens of Ithaca. In 1865 the Legislature of the State of\
        \ New York trans ferred the entire proceeds of the land grant to Cornell Uni\
        \ versity upon compliance with certain conditions, of which the most important\
        \ were that Ezra Cornell should give to the institution five hundred thousand\
        \ dollars, and that pro vision should be made for the education, free of all\
        \ charge for tuition, of one student from each Assembly district of the State.\
        \ At the first meeting of the trustees thereafter Mr. Cornell fulfilled the\
        \ requirements of the charter. He then made the additional gift of over two\
        \ hundred acres of land, with buildings, to be used as a farm in connection\
        \ with the department of agriculture, and also gave the Jewett collection\
        \ in geology. He has made since that time many other large gifts, amounting\
        \ to several hundred thousand dollars. A committee was appointed by the Conference\
        \ composed of Charles Giles, George Harmou, Jonathan Huestis, Joshua Hathaway,\
        \ Joseph Speed, David Woodcock, Jesse Merritt, Charles Humphrey, and Elijah\
        \ Atwater, in whose address of December, 1821, are the following significant\
        \ paragraphs : \" The committee of general superintendence appointed by the\
        \ Con ference have estimated that a fund of $40,000 will be required for the\
        \ erection and completion of the necessary buildings. More than $6000 has\
        \ already been subscribed by the citizens of the village and vicinity, and\
        \ ten acres of ground, embracing the intended site for the buildings, have\
        \ been gratuitously presented to the institution. . . . The University now\
        \ has an invested fund of more than $1,000,000, and about 400,000 acres of\

        \ of the institution, from all sources, aggregates about $100,000. Since its\

        \ its founder, amounting to more than $1,000,000. \"The Ithaca College is\

        \ as any college in the United States, and a system of instruction adopted\
        \ without regard either to particular religious or political opinions.\" The\

        \ About the year 1800, eleven years after the first settle ment, the first\
        \ frame house was erected. It was placed immediately over the spot where the\
        \ rattlesnakes' den had been broken up as already described. The owner was\
        \ Abram Markle, who employed a carpenter named Roger Delano, assisted by Luther\
        \ Gere, his apprentice at the time. Peter Bois, who afterwards married \"\
        \ Polly\" Yaple, was also em ployed upon the building. THE FIRST AND EARLY\
        \ TAVERNS. It is difficult to determine to whom Ithaca is indebted for the\
        \ first building intended for a tavern, but probably the glory belongs to\
        \ Luther Gere, who put up a wooden hotel on the southeast corner of Aurora\
        \ and Seneca Streets in 1805, of which he was both proprietor and landlord.\
        \ \" In 1806,\" says Mr. King, \" the number of buildings had increased to\
        \ twelve, six or seven of which were frame. One was the small building just\
        \ across the street south of this (village) hall, now occupied as a dwelling-house\
        \ and then as a tavern, the landlord of which was a Dr. Hartshorn; another\
        \ was situated where the Tompkins House now is, and was also kept as a tavern\
        \ by Jacob S. Vrooman, a step son of Abram Markle ; and another was the house\
        \ on the southeast corner of Aurora and Seneca Streets, which was afterwards\
        \ kept as a tavern by Mr. Luther Gere.\" This house now stands, somewhat altered\
        \ in late years, and is the third north of Cascadilla Creek on the west side\
        \ of Linn Street. For a short time this building was occupied by Mr. Mar kle,\
        \ who brought up a small stock of goods and opened the first regular store.\
        \ Becoming involved, his indorser, Mr. Simeon De Witt, succeeded to the ownership\
        \ of this struc ture and the small lot upon which it stood. Henceforward it\
        \ was known as the De Witt \" farm house,\" and being then an important and\
        \ conspicuous monument became the initial point of the surveys for the principal\
        \ turnpikes afterwards constructed through the town. The first-named building,\
        \ built by David Quigg for Dr. Hartshorn, was removed in 1865 to give room\
        \ for the \" Cornell Library ;\" of the second, but little of the original\
        \ is now to be seen, the \" light of other days\" coming down to us through\
        \ the quaint little window-panes of what is now the kitchen of the Tompkins\
        \ House, while the last has either entirely passed away or lost its identity\
        \ in the later improvements. This is undoubtedly the building that for a time\
        \ was oc cupied as a \" tavern\" by Archer Green.* It was the first public-house\
        \ in Ithaca, and contrasts oddly with the superb accommodations of the present\
        \ day. There was little danger then that careless guests would either leave\
        \ the gas burning all night or blow it out upon retiring, or leave a water-spigot\
        \ turned to deluge the lower stories. Not far away, up the Cascadilla, Mr.\
        \ Yaple had built the first mill,\\ in 1791, as already described. The first\
        \ complete grist-mill in the town, with bolting-cloth, etc., was erected by\
        \ Joseph S. Sidney, father of Edwin Sidney, prior to the year 1796. This was\
        \ situated on Fall Creek, at what is now called Forest Home, but better known\
        \ as Free Hollow. Mr. Sidney afterwards removed his mill to the Cascadilla,\
        \ near the site of the present mill of John S. Dwyer. Mr. Vrooman swung out\
        \ his sign with the words \" Ithaca Hotel\" emblazoned thereon, adopting the\
        \ name which Mr. De Witt had given to the little growing village several years\
        \ before. The place had been known by divers uncouth names, such as \" The\
        \ Flats,\" \" The City,\" and \" Sodom,\" but they all disappeared like ghosts\
        \ at dawn before the later title. J Four years later (1809), Mr. Gere built\
        \ the then grand structure known far and wide for so many years thereafter\
        \ as the \" Ithaca Hotel.\" The house of Mr. Vrooman had dropped the original\
        \ name, and taken that of the new Governor, Daniel D. Tompkins. The first\
        \ public library in Ithaca was secured by the efforts of Mr. Sidney, who for\
        \ a time was its librarian. About three hundred dollars were raised for the\
        \ purpose. Some years after, with few additions, it became the property The\
        \ new hotel of Mr. Gere\xA7 overshadowed, if it did not X It is perhaps the\
        \ fittest place here to set right the seemingly-settled belies that Mr. Simeon\
        \ De Witt was responsible for the classical names given to the towns of Central\
        \ New York, in the military tract. His reply to the deliberate charge of a\
        \ New York editor, that he was \"godfather of the christened West,\" is sufficient\
        \ refutation : *Mr. Green occupied, previously, the abandoned cabin of Mr.\
        \ Hinepaw, which, in 1804, served as the temporary store of Mr. Quigg, and\
        \ then as a sheep-pen for Mr. De Witt's choice Merinos, and still later as\
        \ the residence of Mr. Peleg Hammond. t \"The proprietor of this village (Ithaca)\

        \ of the first mill in this country are there visible. It is not much larger\
        \ than a large hog-pen, and the stones were the size of the largest grindstones\
        \ ; a trough led the water to the wheel. It ground about forty or fifty bushels\

        of Owego Creek. The amount of lumber sawed at this mill is about 100,000 feet
        a year. A steam grist-mill was built here by the same gentleman, in 1854,
        and was successfully operated by him until July 3, 1863, when it was fired
        by an incendiary ; aud though a great convenience to the people of the neighborhood,
        the pro prietor did not feel justified in rebuilding it. The Caroline cheese-factory
        was erected in the spring of 1869, by R. G. H. Speed. It is 32 by 70 feet,
        contains 20 presses and 500 coolers, and cost $4500. Tbe milk of about 500
        cows is used, and 65,000 pounds of cheese are annually produced. THE CHARLES
        MULKS RURAL CEMETERY ASSOCIATION was incorporated June 27, 1868, for the purpose
        of im proving the old cemetery situated on the Mulks farm. The first interment
        took place in 1817, and was that of Nancy, wife of Benoni Mulks, since which
        members of four gen erations of the Mulks family have found their final resting
        place iu the old burying-ground. The first and present president and secretary
        of the association were Peter Mulks and Samuel P. Ashley. Besides the above
        manufacturing interests there are a blacksmith''s shop, a small grocery-store,
        and a few houses here. It is simply an agricultural settlement, not having
        progressed any since the destruction of the grist-mill. Ridgeway butter- and
        cheese-factory was established by a company incorporated July 19, 1873, with
        a capital of $1400. The trustees were F. A. B. Ridgway, S. D. Stevens, R.

        statistics.) THE CAROLINE LITERARY ASSOCIATION, organized Jan. 13, 1818, established
        the first circulating library in the town, if not the first in the county.
        It con sisted of about forty at first, each owning one or more shares of the
        stock. Its affairs were managed by a board of trustees. Those for the first
        year were Dr. Joseph Speed, John Mulks, Solomon Robison, Abiatha G. Rounsvell,
        Wm. Jackson, John J. Speed, Augustine Boyer, Josiah Perry, Joel Hastings,
        Calvin Holmes, Robert H. Hyde, and James Ashley. It continued in existence
        for about a decade, when it seems to have lapsed for want of interest. Dr.
        Speed was the first librarian, and appears to have been its residuary legatee
        also. CAROLINE CENTRE is located a little east of the geographical centre
        of the town from which it receives its name. Among the early settlers here
        and in this vicinity were Augustin Boyer, Hugh Boyer, Dr. Joseph Speed, John

        \ who died Jan. 27, 1858, aged nineteen years and ten days. She had expressed\

        \ site, embracing about twenty-two and a half acres, which grounds included\
        \ the vault of Dr. Watkins. Magee proposed to Freer to purchase the ground\
        \ at $100 per acre, and that he would pay $50 per acre and donate it to the\

        \ noted for what it lacked than for what it possessed. The type and other\
        \ material were old, worn, and worthless. The press, an old one, had passed\
        \ through the fire of 1849, and, though repaired, was a clumsy, heavy machine,\
        \ and, taken as a whole, the investment looked far from promising. The Advertiser,\
        \ in its best days under Mr. Calhoun, never had four hundred bond fide subscribers,\
        \ the Democrats still controlled the county patronage, and dividends from\
        \ the investment were not discernible, even with the eye of faith of the most\
        \ sanguine ; but Mr. Smyth resolved to make the best of his (so thought) bad\
        \ bargain. He purchased in New York an entire new outfit for his paper, and\
        \ issued the first number of the Owego Southern Tier Times on Juue 22, 1854.\
        \ In the issue of June 7, 1855, the words \" Southern Tier\" were dropped,\
        \ and the present name, the owego advertiser* first appeared March 25, 1836,\
        \ owned and edited by An drew II. Calhoun. Till then the Democratic party\
        \ had held full sway in what had been previously known as Tioga County, and\
        \ all attempts to break down its influence met with the most decided opposition.\
        \ The new paper from its inception had a hard road to travel, without political\
        \ pa tronage, all the offices being in Democratic hands. Yet there were several\
        \ respectable and influential old Whig fam ilies in the county who were not\
        \ willing to imbibe Demo cratic doctrine or submit to Democratic dictation,\
        \ and these all supported the Advertiser to the best of their ability. Mr.\
        \ Calhoun came from Canajoharie to Owego at the ex press invitation of these\
        \ old Whigs, and brought his press, etc., on a sleigh. The paper was a six-column\
        \ folio, the sheet being about 30 inches long by 22 wide. In 1840 it was enlarged\
        \ to seven columns. Mr. Calhoun was vigorous and indomitable in controversy\
        \ ; bitter and personal at a time when personalities were the rage in politics.\
        \ He attacked his opponents in their weakest points in reply to attacks upon\
        \ the new paper and the party it represented. Mr. Calhoun made the first attempt\
        \ at the publication of a daily paper in Owego in 1838, and issued the first\
        \ num ber of the Daily News aud Advertiser on October 18. It had four pages,\
        \ of three columns each, the sheet being 12 by 18 inches in size. It was published\
        \ but a few weeks. The Democratic party, all powerful when united, was frequently\
        \ rent by factions, which inharmony was made the most of by the Whigs, who\
        \ did aught else but play the role of reconciliation among their political\
        \ enemies, and thereby secured many a local sugar-plum at the public crib.\
        \ THE OWEGO TIMES, was placed at its head, the editor saying, \" By a glance\
        \ at our first page our readers will observe a slight change of name. The\
        \ words ' Southern Tier' are omitted. This change, we think, is for the better.\
        \ It localizes and indi vidualizes. The Southern Tier Times did the one, but\
        \ left the other undone, while the whole name was long enough and assuming\
        \ enough for a Spanish grandee. For the southern tier of counties we shall\
        \ continue to write as often and as well as we can, but will not assume the\
        \ ex clusive right to what is a duty common to many other journals, several\
        \ of which are equal and some superior to the Owego Times.\" In the fire of\
        \ 1849 the Advertiser office and its contents were entirely destroyed, but\
        \ as soon as new material could be purchased the publication of the paper\
        \ was resumed, the office being in Mr. Calhoun's own building, being the same\
        \ as is now occupied by W. H. Roche, on Lake Street, as a fruit and confectionery\
        \ store. After the fire of 1849, Wm. B. Calhoun, eldest son of the editor,\
        \ became associated in the publication of the Advertiser with his father,\
        \ which connection continued until July, 1852, when William com menced running\
        \ as mail agent, on a line of steameis plying between New York and San Francisco.\
        \ In July, 1850, Mr. Calhoun was appointed canal appraiser, having been pre\
        \ viously (1848) chosen clerk of the Senate. His official duties of necessity\
        \ called him away from his editorial duties, which were performed by his son,\
        \ S. Howard Calhoun, but not satisfactorily so to the influential men of the\
        \ party, who, to restore to the Advertiser its former power and influence,\
        \ purchased it and its material of Mr. Calhoun in May, 1853. This company\
        \ consisted of William Smyth, B. F. Traey, The Times rapidly increased its\
        \ circulation, and in 1856 its political influence was acknowledged. The Republican\
        \ party had sprung into existence, and almost in its cradle had grappled with\
        \ slavery in all its forms. The Demo cratic party was pro-slavery in its sympathies\
        \ and in its po litical action, but there was a powerful element therein opposed\
        \ to slavery extension, if not to the system itself. This element united with\
        \ the equally powerful element of the old Whig party, and the union constituted\
        \ the Repub lican party in this county, which, under the lead of the Owego\
        \ Times, soon gained the ascendency. From 1856 to the present time Tioga County\

        by Rev. H. E. Ford. There were seven constituent members, namely : Armenia
        Quick, Catharine Martin, Andrew Crandall, Emma C. Ganung, Sarah Whitford,
        Fidelia Clauharty, and Thankful P. Cook. The first preachers were Revs. H.
        E. Ford and George Balcom, who filled the pulpit about six months each. The
        first regular pastor was Rev. M. U. Holmes, who took charge of the church
        in January, 1870. The first church officers were E. W. Cook, L. C. Crandall,
        and Jacob Yaple, Deacons ; F. A. Ganung, G. W. Hall, E. W. Cook, E. T. Merritt,
        M. T. Brodriek, and Whitford, Trustees; George Balcom, Clerk. Among the establishments
        that have acquired a time honored history are the Decker Flouring-Mills, which
        were erected about the year 1802 or 1803, by Bowers k Kimball. The mill, as
        at first built, was a thirty feet square one and one-half story building,
        which is now in cluded in the present structure. After a few years, Mr. Kimball
        retired from the original copartnership, and Mr. Bowers continued sole proprietor
        for a time. Afterwards a man by the name of Wood bought a half-interest in
        the property, and the firm-style was changed to Bowers k Wood. This continued
        until 1835, when William T. Jackson pur chased the entire property, improved
        it materially, and three years thereafter sold it to Simon Decker. In 1840,
        Mr. Decker altered and improved the property, and in 1852-53 erected the present
        mills, which he operated until 1866, when he sold them to the present proprietors,
        E. A. Dun ham k Brother. There are uow four runs of stone, and the annual
        product of the mills is about 25,000 bushels per annum. There is also a plaster-mill
        connected, which grinds 250 tons a year. The church edifice was erected by
        E. W. Cook, and by him donated to the society. It was completed in 1873, and
        dedicated by the Rev. Dr. Armitage, of New York, on the 14th of January of
        the same year. The building is of brick, of pleasing architectural design,
        and handsome inte rior finish. It is comfortably furnished, and will seat
        about 500 persons. The church property is valued at $40,000. The present officers
        are E. W. Cook, S. A. Clauharty, and Amos Barber, Deacons ; M. T. Brodriek,
        James K. Young, Buel S. Sackett, Elbert P. Cook, George M. Post, and George
        Corwin, Trustees ; I. J. Bassett, Clerk. Pastor, Rev. George A. Starkweather;
        membership, 175; number of teachers and scholars in Sunday-school, 103; Superin
        tendent, Prof. Hill ; number of volumes in library, 175 ; Librarian, Isaac
        Miller. The Woolen-Mill erected near the flouring-mills, and using the same
        water-power, was built by William T. Jack son in 1836, and by him sold to
        Simon and Sydney G. Decker in 1838. It was originally used as a linseed-oil
        factory, subsequently converted into a sash-, door-, and blind-factory, and
        operated as such by Henry Lybolt and others until 1867, when Mr. Decker put
        in the necessary machinery for the manufacture of wool. It is not now in operation,
        but the machinery is still there, and when times will warrant it will doubtless
        start up again. The woolen mill now operated by Amos Barber was erected by
        Major William Skellenger about the same time that he built the foundry on
        the hill. The woolen-mill property was sold by Mr. Skellenger''s heirs to
        Mr. Barber. The factory turns out a good quality of woolen cloth and does

        17 constituent members in 1870. Their house of worship was erected in 1869.
        will seat about 200 persons, and is valued at $2000. The first trustees were
        George Strong, Albert Lowery, H. V. Prime, J. S. Gil bert, and H. Williams.
        The present pastor is Rev. N. E. Collins, of Elmira; membership, 15; Sunday-school
        scho lars, 10; present trustees, George Strong, George Dove, Charles Darrow,
        and John Jackson. The churches of Havana are generally supplied with effi
        cient and earnest pastors, who are ably sustained in their work by the members
        of their flocks, respectively. Com parative statistics of the various churches
        show a fair in crease in membership, and an earnest fellowship which is commendable.
        Very little sectarian bitterness is observable, an unusual harmony apparently
        existing between the dif ferent sects. This is as it should be, for perfect
        fraternity among Protestant religious denominations is much to be desired,
        as in the unity of the sects is involved their per petuity. carding. The Schuyler
        Stoneware- Works occupy the site of the glass-works, erected by Charles Cook,
        about 1845, but never used for the purpose for which they were built. The
        prop erty was purchased by A. O. Whittemore, and by him con verted into a
        factory for the manufacture of all kinds of stone-ware. The old building was
        destroyed by fire in December, 1862, and by the following February the present
        structure was ready to put into operation. It is still run ning. Capital invested,
        $10,000; hands employed, 10. MANUFACTURING INTERESTS. The Alontour Iron- Works
        were built by Captain Hill, for Charles Cook, in 1850. In 1867, A. O. Whittemore
        and G. W. Hall leased the premises of the Cook estate, and There was a time

        \ each. A deposit of books to that amount was made equivalent to one share.\

        \ in their ten dency were admitted, and that tbe \" poor and trustworthy\"\
        \ who could not subscribe were permitted to use them ; and that memberships\
        \ were not confined to the Methodist So ciety. David Ayres was then librarian.\

        of the land and signing the agreement, charging the com mittee had no power
        to go as far as they had, and that land in Southport was a favorable location.
        Mr. Smith offered a resolution to reverse the action of the committee, but
        it was not carried, and the original resolutions of the majority of the committee
        were concurred in, and their ac tion affirmed by a vote of twelve for to six
        against. In 1870, ''73, ''74 fairs were held, but the secretary''s books do

        in its scope and jurisdiction, held its first fair in Elmira, June 28, 1854.
        It was a very creditable exhibition of flowers and fruits, and other fairs
        were held in the same village subsequently. In 1855 the display of flowers
        was a notable one. Mr. Miller and others applied for an injunction to stay
        the issuance of the bonds, but without effect, and bonds to the amount of
        $50,000 were issued. The report of the treasurer of that society stated that
        he had received the bonds of the county to the amount of $50,000 ; had paid
        $24,479.25 for the purchase of the premises near Elmira, had expemlrd $29,520.75

        of the Legislature of 1871 enabled the county of Chemung to purchase grounds
        for holding the fairs of the State and County Agricultural Societies, and
        to improve the same, and to raise for that purpose by taxation a sum not exceeding
        $50,000, and to convey the lands and improve ments to the State Agricultural
        Society, with such reserva tions as the Board of Supervisors should deem proper.
        These provisions were to be inoperative until the same were approved by the
        people at an election to be held for that purpose. An election was ordered
        by the supervisors on May 15, 1872, the vote for such election being passed
        at a special meeting held April 29, 1872. The election was held accordingly,
        and resulted in 3034 votes for the pro posed action, and 1340 against it,
        and the Board decided the proposition carried. On June 11, at a special meeting
        held that day, the Board appointed the chairman, Edmund Miller, M. V. B. Bachman,
        C. H. Rowland, N. Owen, and George Maby a committee to receive proposals for
        the sale of land for fair purposes, and to confer with the New York State
        Agricultural Society as to the location of the same, and the terms on which
        the State Society would accept the same. On motion, the names of the members
        of the com mittee, except that of the chairman, were stricken out of the appointment,
        and thereupon the chairman appointed Jud Smith, M. V. B. Bachman, C. H. Rowland,
        and C. W. Gardner his colleagues on the committee. Subse quently the Board
        visited several sites offered for fair grounds. The majority of the committee
        reported the se lection of 50 acres, at $400 per acre for a portion, and $412.50
        for a portion, and submitted resolutions that the Board cause the chairman
        and clerk to sign the agreement with the State Society for the transfer of
        the lands to the society, and to issue bonds to the amount of $50,000, dated
        July 1, 1872, bearing seven per cent, interest, payable in ten annual payments,
        and apply the proceeds to the pur chase of land, and transfer the same and
        the balance of the money to the State Society. The conveyance of the land

        those of the Elmira Driving Park Asso ciation on the north, and are very eligibly
        located. The State Society has held its fairs hereon regularly in course since
        1872, and its next one will be held here the present autumn. The investment
        of the county, as shown elsewhere, is, original amount of bonds, $50,000 ;
        interest paid to Feb. 1, 1878, $15,750; interest yet to be paid, $3500; total,
        $69,250. $30,000 have been paid on the bonds and $20,000 are yet outstanding,
        payable $5000 per annum. THE CHEMUNG COUNTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY was incorporated
        April 2r 1838, by an act of the Legisla ture, John Arnot, Robert Covell, William
        Maxwell, Ste phen Tuttle, William Jenkins, Simeon Benjamin, Samuel Partridge,
        Theodore North, and William Foster being the incorporators. It is now a thing
        of the past, and has been for many years. THE CHEMUNG VALLEY HISTORICAL SOCIETY
        was organized June 1, 1876, by the adoption of a constitu tion and the election
        of officers. The object of the society, as declared by the constitution, is
        " to discover, procure, and preserve whatever may relate to the past and present

        \ Superintendent to the several counties and cities having special charters\
        \ according to population at last census, and the money received into each\
        \ county treasury is subdivided to the districts by the school commissioners\

        \ school year of at least twenty-eight weeks. Our union district now receives\
        \ an nually between $60 and $70. If our youth attended more regularly, we\
        \ should, of course, receive a much larger amount. We have a right to increase\
        \ the amount by public tax. This has been a good region for tanning, on account\
        \ of the abundance of hemlock-bark so easily had. The three tanneries now\
        \ in operation are doing well. PIANO MANUFACTORY. This was started in May,\
        \ 1857, by E. Hosford, dealer in pianos. In the fall of 1861 a firm was organized,\
        \ consisting of H. Norton, F. Sporer, and O. M. Carlson. They subsequently\
        \ associated with them Mr. J. Berry. In 1867 they were burned out, but started\
        \ again in 1868. They have manufactured nearly 900 pianos since the open ing\

        \ improvements now in use, and are praised by musicians'generally. The foregoing\
        \ is from the prefatory chapter of the cata logue of the Owego Free Academy\
        \ Library, with by-laws, for June, 1871. This library has floated into more\
        \ public use, and now has 2240 volumes ; the selections and con tributions\
        \ have been made with reference to the higher attainments of its readers,\
        \ and it is germain to the question of the proper use and influence of a library\
        \ to say that its influence is most felt when it reaches the greatest number.\
        \ This is too plain to need demonstration, the only barrier to its ready admission\
        \ and complete establishment being the bigotry and selfishness of a few persons,\
        \ who in small com munities are apt to get the lead, and so control whatever\
        \ public spirit may show itself as to serve their own narrow minded purposes,\
        \ not realizing that intelligence begets liberality, and liberality intelligence,\
        \ and that the true and enduring basis of the social fabric is intelligence,\
        \ \u2014 the power that civilizes and refines, elevates and ennobles, begets\
        \ and perpetuates our institutions of which we are so proud, and without which\
        \ we could not claim a place worthy of the respect of mankind. It is when\
        \ we realize this grand power and breathe its intellectual inspiration that\
        \ our being expands into its philanthropic capabilities and throbs with the\
        \ pulsations of duty, conserving the good of community, banishing from it\
        \ ignorance and vice, and drawing towards us the benedictions of our race.\
        \ Our public libraries in our larger cities have done more to edu cate the\
        \ masses than all other agencies, not excepting com mon schools ; for here\
        \ independence of thought is born or nurtured and cultivated, \u2014 and to\
        \ think independently is to become self-reliant. And, happily for our age,\
        \ there is no subject too sacred for investigation, and few that have yet\
        \ need of elucidation ; so that a well-selected library is not only the most\
        \ potent engine in breaking down the ignorance and prejudice that linger as\
        \ the relics of the barbaric past, but the bulwark of freedom, for truth alone\

        \ it came into possession of the board of education of the village. All these\

        \ as our means permit, and valuable as a library of useful reading and reference\
        \ to all our people, and especially to those who attend schools. The attention\

        \ of Ithaca prior to 1810. He was a lawyer of high standing, and took promi\
        \ nent part in whatever related to the well-being of the place, whether of\
        \ civil or political import. Isaac Beers, who came to Ithaca in 1809, was\
        \ one of Ithaca's pioneers in business, built a fine brick block on State\
        \ Street, and was in all respects a worthy citizen. He was once librarian\
        \ of the first library, of which mention is elsewhere made. He was appointed\
        \ master of the Court of Chancery, in 1808, assistant attorney-general, April\
        \ 15, 1817 ; was the same year postmaster, and as such announced that after\
        \ October 1 there would be no more trust for letter-postage. He became president\
        \ of the \" Steamboat Company\" upon its organization in 1819 ; was president\
        \ of the village in 1823-24-26, and represented his district (then the Twenty\
        \ fifth) in the Twentieth Congress\u2014 1827-29. Through several of the children\
        \ of some of her pioneers, the county of Tioga is intimately joined in history\
        \ to the county of Tompkins. Conspicuous among the names thus found are those\
        \ of Drake, Ferris, and Mack. Caleb B. Drake, a son of Benjamin Drake, one\
        \ of the first settlers in Spencer, became a resident of Ithaca about the\
        \ year 1805, and purchased from Luther Gere 66 feet on Owego Street, now the\
        \ southeast corner of Tioga and State Streets, where for some years he lived\
        \ and had an office. He was appointed justice of the peace for Ulysses as\
        \ early as 1819, and was from time to time elected to that office for the\
        \ county of Tompkins until 1857. He served also as police justice, by appointment\
        \ from the corporate authorities, and administered the duties of that position\
        \ rigorously towards \" old offenders,\" so much so that \" Five dollars and\
        \ thirty days\" seemed the stereotyped court expression. In 1809 Mr. Woodcock\
        \ purchased two lots on \" Owego\" Street, lying next west of Tioga, and running\
        \ through to Seneca, and built a small house at the southeast and an office\
        \ at the southwest corner thereof. He afterwards built the brick house now\
        \ occupied by the savings bank, at the northeast corner of this land. The\
        \ Tioga Street front of the lot became the favorite rallying-point for the\
        \ increasing numbers of the legal fra ternity, and was soon made to bristle\
        \ with office-gables of various antique orders, some of which have now, alas\
        \ ! departed. Mr. Drake married in 1810 Aurelia, the daughter of Salmon Buell,\
        \ who was then the widow of John M. Pear son, and afterwards married for his\
        \ second wife Lucy Ann Buckley. His death occurred about the year 1857 or\
        \ 1858. A number of his children, of whom there was a large family, are residents\
        \ of Ithaca. Mr. Woodcock had several children, of whom Cornelia became the\
        \ wife of Benjamin G. Ferris, and Mary the wife of Stephen B. Cushing. Mr.\
        \ Cushing was an attorney of fine abilities, the law partner of Mr. Ferris,\
        \ and occupied positions of trust and prominence. He was assemblyman in 1852,\
        \ and elected attorney-general in the fall of 1855. Three sons of Stephen\
        \ Mack, the pioneer printer of Tioga County, came to Ithaca from Owego, and\
        \ made permanent settlement, after the death of their father, in 1814. Mr.\

        \ Joshua S. Lee, whom we find in Ithaca doing business as a druggist in the\
        \ first quarter of the century, an earnest and honest citizen, and one among\
        \ the few survivors who are still residents. Vincent Conrad and George McCormick,\
        \ active business men of the middle period, promoting and sustaining the ac\

        \ of the Owego Gazette, sold out, and removed to Ithaca in 1816, where he\
        \ in turn became the principal pioneer of the press of Tompkins County, and\

        \ years State senator, representing his (then the sixth) senatorial district\
        \ from and after 1837. He united the business of book-selling and publishing\
        \ to his other interests at an early period, and finally that of paper-making\
        \ in 1823, when the firm was Mack & Morgan. His life was one of unusual application,\

        was set off from Montgomery County in 1791, and was a portion of Tioga County.
        March 28, 1806, Broome County was formed from Tioga, and this territory was
        in the apportionment of territory to the new county, and so remained until
        March 21, 1822, when Owego and Berkshire were annexed to Tioga County. This
        town was formed from the town of Tioga (Owego), Broome Co., which was a part
        of the. general division of the Boston Purchase, Feb. 12, 1808, and was called
        Berk shire, from the fact that most of the settlers came from Berkshire Co.,
        Mass. Newark Valley was taken off in 1823, Richford in 1831, reducing it to
        its present limits. Young, P. S. Worden, 1848-49; A. C. Sperry, 1850; Asa

        \ grandfather, both of the same name, were born re spectively Dec. 21, 1738,\
        \ and Dec. 9, 1715. The latter died at the age of twenty-three years, three\
        \ months before the birth of his only child. The ancestry has been traced\
        \ no farther back on the father's aide. The mother of John Ten Brook, of Elmira,\
        \ Charity Van Neste by name, was directly descended from Sarah Rappelye, the\
        \ first white child born in what is now New York City, whose birth took place\
        \ July 7, 1625, when the little colony was in peril of starvation. The gov\
        \ ernor called at the house the day after the birth of this child, and inquired\
        \ of the mother if they had any bread ; she replied that they had none ; he,\
        \ unwilling to accept the answer, searched the house, and found one Indian\
        \ dumpling, which he divided, taking one-half and leaving the other. On the\
        \ next day a cargo of provisions arrived, and the governor sent to the Rappelyes\
        \ a measure of flour. John Ten Brook's father was colonel of a New Jersey\
        \ regiment of militia in the Revolution ; his regiment was called out, and\
        \ the son could remember to have gone to the camp with supplies for his father.\
        \ When the war was over the father sold his farm for $9000, and from the patriotic\
        \ conviction that the government would not allow the holders of its paper\
        \ to suffer, took the whole sum in Continental money. This was soon worthless.\

        \ wild land one and a half miles northwest of Horseheads, which property he\
        \ still owned at the time of his death, in 1843. He died while on a visit\
        \ to Lenawee Co., Mich., and was buried there. His wife died in 1832, and\
        \ was buried at the Marsh meeting-house. Both were members of the church assembling\

        \ in the Assembly of 1832. Besides these, he filled other positions of honor\
        \ and trust, among which were those of county clerk and president and trustee\
        \ of the village. He was identified with many enterprises favoring the growth\
        \ and prosperity of the place. His nearly forty years of life in Ithaca was\
        \ marked by a generous and honorable activity, ending only with his death,\
        \ in 1855. at Cayuga Street, Mr. Beebe becoming the leader of the \" British\"\

        \ of Colonel Samuel Drake, and doing duty in scoutinc parties and patroling\

        \ be considered an attempt to dispel some of the romance from our Revolutionary\
        \ history, we must give, as history, Mr. Ferris' version of the facts concerning\
        \ the retention of Major Andre by his three captors. His acquaintance with\
        \ at least two of them was such as a citizen is apt to gain of the \"characters\"\
        \ or chronic idlers of his native village. Conversing on a certain occasion\
        \ with one of them (we think Paulding), Mr. Ferris asked him why they did\
        \ not accept the watch of Andre and let him go. The answer was that they were\
        \ \" too d \u2014 d afraid of one another,\" and that Andre's anxiety led\
        \ them to think that more would be ob tained by keeping him. Mr. Ferris' opinion\
        \ was that they were free booters, and he often laughed at suggestions of\
        \ their patriotism. Mr. Hill, however, made no speeches; he was a prac tical\

        \ until such time as the provisions could be carried out. In 1868, C. W. Slagle\
        \ was re-elected President, J. M. Shaffer, Edward Campbell, Jr., A. T. Wells,\
        \ Ward Lamson, George H. Case and C. S. Clarke Directors. At this meeting,\
        \ already referred to as consisting of C. W. Slagle, H. G. Knepp, Geo. H.\
        \ Case, J. M. and C. S. Shaffer and George Acheson, a new era dawned in the\
        \ history of the Association. During that year, nine meetings were held, and\
        \ the attendance indicated that the Library had received a new impetus. The\
        \ great question was, \"How can we keep open the Library at least two days\
        \ in each week without expense to the society?\" The problem was solved by\
        \ Ed. Campbell, Jr., and, acting under his suggestion, dating from June 10,\
        \ the work was confided to young ladies, who managed it admirably, keeping\
        \ at least two of their number at the Library each Wednesday and Saturday.\
        \ At this period of its existence, Miss Fannie Slagle deserves especial mention\
        \ for several years of continued and faithful service as an assistant Librarian.\
        \ At the annual meeting in 1869, the old officers were re-elected, except\
        \ that J. F. Wilson took the place of George H. Case. Dr. Shaffer concluded\
        \ his address in these words : \" Now came a dark day \u2014 a day of reproach\
        \ and confusion. The entire dues of 1868 were only $21.80, while the rent\
        \ and express charges were over $100. What was to be done? For George Stever\
        \ held our warrant for $120, and he could have wound us up and sold out the\
        \ concern. Mrs. Dr. Clarke and Mrs. C. W. Slagle appointed themselves a committee,\
        \ and determined to pay the debt by voluntary contributions of the married\
        \ ladies. None of the maid ens or masculines were asked for a single cent\
        \ ; but by some means, Misses Maggie Jeffers and Mary Hamilton got mixed up\
        \ in the crowd of one hun dred and fifteen who paid $126.10. You may imagine\
        \ how supremely glad Stever was when I paid him the $120 and elevated the\
        \ warrant. Once more out of the slough of debt and on the smooth rolling road\
        \ of prosperity, through the labors and efforts of Mrs. Dr. Clarke and Mrs.\
        \ C. W. Slagle.\" \" The little ones also gave an entertainment, under the\
        \ direction of Miss Kate Rowland, and paid $23.75 to our Treasurer as the\
        \ net proceeds.\" In 1870, the only change made in the directory was that\
        \ W. R. Wells took the place of C. S. Clarke. In 1871, at the annual meeting,\
        \ there were present thirteen stockholders. C. W. Slagle was kept in the presidential\
        \ chair, and A. T. Wells, J. M. Shaf fer, C. D. Leggett, Scott Jordan, D.\
        \ B. Wilson and C. S. Clarke were elected Directors. In 1872, fourteen stockholders\
        \ were present. Charles S. Clarke was elected President, and C. W. Slagle,\
        \ Charles Negus and Ward Lamson, Direc tors. The Board elected J. M. Shaffer\
        \ Secretary and A. S. Jordan Treasurer. It was determined this year to use\
        \ the fund placed in the possession of the Association for that purpose, and\
        \ secure a better room for the Library. The proposition of Evan Craine and\
        \ William McComb was accepted, and, on No vember 18, the first meeting of\
        \ the Board was held in the Library-room in Craine's new building. Eight hundred\
        \ dollars were paid in cash, which secured the room for ten years, free of\
        \ rent; and in case of the building being destroyed by fire, the owners are\
        \ bound to rebuild or refund the sum paid them. In compliance with the second\
        \ stipulation of the Monumental Association, an effort was made on Decoration\

    - ["480 HISTORY OF JEFFERSON COUNTY. In closing this sketch of an institution\
        \ which is an honor to the people, who, by their support, have brought it\
        \ to its present high state of usefulness, special mention should be made\
        \ of the four persons most closely identified with its history. To Ward Lamson,\
        \ Esq., whose love of education and a desire to stimulate the mind of the\
        \ community to a more advanced plane of thought, led him to conceive the establishment\
        \ of a public library, marked praise should be awarded. When Lamson had planted,\
        \ Dr. J. M. Shaffer came to cultivate, and, as Librarian for many years without\
        \ compensation or hope of reward, right nobly did he discharge his work. It\
        \ is no disparagement to Mr. Lamson to say that but for the energy, the liberality,\
        \ the patience and persistent industry of Dr. Shaf fer, the seed he planted\
        \ would have gone to decay, and instead of a library and a museum of which\
        \ not only the county, but the State may be proud, there would be now but\
        \ the memory of the effort to remind the people that such an institution had\
        \ ever been contemplated. Hon. James F. Wilson, during his long term in public\
        \ life, ever remem bered the little library at home. His residence at Washington,\
        \ and association with prominent men of the nation, gave him superior advantages\
        \ of which the Library has received the benefit. His individual contributions\
        \ to the Associa tion have been frequent and liberal, and through his efforts\
        \ have been secured a large portion of its present valuable collections. And\
        \ finally, due credit must be given A. T. Wells, Esq., the present Librarian,\
        \ for his very efficient management of the details of the Library. LECTURE\
        \ COURSE. In October, 1876, 0. L. Hackett, Esq., a son of Providence, R. I.,\
        \ inaugurated measures that resulted in the establishment of a regular lecture\
        \ and amusement course. The enterprise has been well sustained by the Fairfield\
        \ public, who by this means are afforded a series of amusing and instructive\
        \ entertainments that could not have been otherwise secured. Among the lecturers\
        \ and readers that have been induced to visit Fairfield through Mr. Hackett's\
        \ agency, are Wendell Phillips, Rev. David Swing, Rev. Robert Collyer, Gen.\
        \ Kilpatrick, Helen Potter, Laura Dainty and others. The great secret of Mr.\
        \ Hackett's success is the fact that previous to his coming West he was for\
        \ ten years a member of different lecture committees, and not only enjoys\
        \ a personal acquaintance with many of the prominent lecturers in the country,\
        \ but also knows what kind of talent will suit the people. THE PRESS. \"But\

        " We studied diligently the use of courteous language, polite address and
        the most winning of influences to persuade men that here, for the paltry considera
        tion of $3 they might drink of perennial fountains, that would spring up within
        them a well of infinite pleasure and delight. All these arts and all this
        elo quence proved utterly futile ; and we want no better illustration of the
        dogma of total depravity than the startling fact that my next-door neighbor
        (a vender of peanuts, cakes, beer and candy) grew rich and increased in goods,
        while the Library languished or only maintained its existence. The result
        may also prove that, while every man has a stomach, very few have brains."
        In 1861, John Bond was elected President ; J. F. Wilson, John Shuffleton,
        C. S. Clarke, Ward Lamson, L. F. Boerstler and William H. Jordan, Direct ors.
        Ward Lamson was made Secretary and Mrs. C. S. Clarke, Librarian. The latter
        declining, George A. Wells was substituted, at an estimated salary of $12.50
        per year, out of which he was to furnish rent, fuel and stationery. In 1862,
        the stockholders met at Slagle & Acheson''s office. John Bond was continued
        as President, and C. W. Slagle took the place of J. F. Wilson in the Board.
        In December of this year, G. A. Wells resigned the office of Librarian, and
        S. Light was elected in his stead, at the same compensation. In 1863, C. W.
        Slagle was promoted to the Presidency. W. Lamson, W. H. Jordan, John Shuffleton,
        J. M. Shaffer, C. S. Clarke and W. W. Junkin were elected Directors. The Board
        re-elected Lamson Secretary, and S. Light continued as Librarian. Dr. Shaffer
        continues : " And now we reach an item which shall redound to the everlasting
        honor of our friend and townsman James F. Wilson, who receives the thanks
        of the society for his interest in the Library. To him we are indebted for
        the best reference library in the West. And when the sum is added up and the
        total announced, if James F. Wilson''s name is not associated with the greatest
        num ber and most valuable set of books pertaining to the history of this Government,
        its laws, institutions, workings and efforts in every direction, then you
        will scan our catalogues in vain." The officers in 1864 were the same as the
        year previous, except that Samuel C. Farmer and William Long took the places
        of W. W. Junkin and W. H. Jordan. March 17, 1865, the stockholders met at
        S. Light''s store, and, C. W. Slagle being re-elected President, the following
        were chosen Directors : Ward Lamson, C. S. Clarke, George A. Wells, William
        Long, A. T. Wells and J. H. Wells. On May 16, of the same year, A. T. Wells
        was chosen Librarian, a position he has filled from that day to the present.
        Of A. T. Wells, Dr. Shaffer remarked : " To him more than any one person we
        are indebted for the growth, useful ness and prosperity of the Library. He
        has done all sorts of work for it, even performing menial services for the
        love of the cause. Upon him has devolved the care of the room and the books,
        the removals from place to place, the whole interior working of its finances,
        its records, the collection of its accounts, and a hundred details known only
        to those who comprehend the entire situa tion. The grateful thanks of this
        community are due him for his ceaseless labor and intelligent effort in behalf
        of the Library." In December, 1867, the Jefferson County Monumental Association
        turned over its funds to the Library, with the provisions: 1st. That the funds
        be used only to procure a permanent building or room for the Library ; 2d,

        \ Ward Lamson, Dr. C. W. Slagle, Dr. Robert McElhinny, and a few others, whom\
        \ we will mention directly, it could not have survived those perilous days.\
        \ At one time, the patient was what worldly people call ' on its last legs.'\
        \ It had a most remarkable paralysis for several years. There was an almost\
        \ entire loss of sensation, and of motion there was not the least sign. \"\
        \ Strange to say, there was not any appreciable loss of flesh, nor change\
        \ in the complexion \u2014 and, like any other chronic case of sickness, people\
        \ forgot to inquire about it, and very many believed it was dead and buried\
        \ long ago. Now there happened a wonderful thing. It was at the annual consultation\
        \ of the doctors and friends of the patient on the third Friday of March,\
        \ 1868. The principal physician and his second adviser [the speaker. \u2014\
        \ Ed.] alone were present. It was ordered that steps be at once taken to summon\
        \ additional counsel, and Drs. George H. Case, C. S. Shaffer, George Acheson\
        \ and H. G- Knepp were brought into the presence. These six magnanimous workers\
        \ elected a board of counselors, passed resolutions declaring the patient\
        \ fairly convalescent, and calling upon everybody to come and watch with it,\
        \ give it the medicine regularly, nurse it carefully ; and, by St. Paul, the\
        \ girls came, and of course the boys followed ; the old ladies came, and of\
        \ course their husbands followed ; and what, with good treatment and good\
        \ nursing it not only recov ered, but has grown to be such a tremendous fellow\
        \ that already the doctors are looking out for larger rooms to accommodate\
        \ his increased proportions.\" In 1855, J. F. Wilson and D. Sheward took the\
        \ places of DuBois and Moberly, as Directors. The next year, William B. Littleton\
        \ took the place of Lamson on the Board. In 1857, Lamson was chosen President\
        \ ; J. M. Shaffer, George Bond, Wickliffe M. Clark and W. W. Junkin, Managers.\
        \ Junkin was chosen Secre tary, but, as there was no meeting, no record was\
        \ made. In 1858, Ward Lamson was re-elected President, and C. W. Slagle, W.\
        \ H. Jordan, C. S. Clarke, J. M. Slagle, J. M. Shaffer and John Shuffleton,\
        \ Directors. \" At this meeting, on motion of Mr. Negus, the stockholders\
        \ paid me my salary. I had acted as Librarian for five years, keeping the\
        \ room open on Saturday afternoons ; the friends were anxious to make a tangible\
        \ exhibition of their appreciation of distinguished and faithful services.\
        \ The sum named was $10, and the resolution was carried unanimously. That\
        \ is one of the great secrets of my pecuniary success in life \u2014 doing\
        \ good work and getting pay for it ! [The Library was located in the private\

        \ floor of the Hall for it. Gov. Belcher left his library, consisting of 474\
        \ volumes, to the college, by will, when he died; and in 1764 the whole number\
        \ of volumes was about 2,200. In the Revolutionary War the Hessian soldiers,\

        \ them many volumes which they had not destroyed, some of them being afterwards\
        \ found in North Carolina, where they had been taken by the soldiers. They\

        \ that reason they were not destroyed. In 1802 the library had been so far\

    - ["THEOLOGICAL SEMINAR Y\u2014 INVESTMENTS. 341 The number of Scholarships reported\
        \ was eighty-one. This number is yearly increasing. The annual salary paid\
        \ each professor is $3,000 and a house whose rental is worth $500 and upwards.\
        \ The salary ofthe Assistant Treasurer is $3,000. The salary ofthe Librarian\
        \ is $2,100. The Library ofthe theological seminary is a very valuable one\
        \ and contains very many rare books. Testimony to this effect is frequently\
        \ borne by persons who visit it, after having prosecuted their researches\
        \ in other large libraries in our large cities. The present excellent librarian,\
        \ the Rev. William H. Rob erts, states the number of volumes at 30,600, with\
        \ 8,000 pamphlets. In this library are included the once private libraries\
        \ of Dr. Breckinridge, Dr. Nesbit, Alumni, Society of Inquiry, Dr. Addison\
        \ Alexander, Dr. Krebs, Mr. Colwell; also very fine gifts from Messrs. Lenox,\
        \ R. L. and A. Stuart, Levi P. Stone, R. L. Kennedy and other persons too\
        \ numerous to mention. The Sprague collection of pamphlets is one of the largest\
        \ and finest in the country. It would be interesting if we could here enumerate\
        \ the many rare, beautiful and valuable gifts which are deposited in this\
        \ library. We have before described the building; but only a visit, and that\
        \ not a short one, could convey to the visitor a true idea of the treasures\

        \ of Professors Miller, the three Alexanders, Breckinridge, Charles Hodge,\

    - ['THE GUARD-CHAMBER Lambeth Palace.] 433 A building of modern date, adjacent
        to the library, serves as the manuscript-room ; it was put into thorough repair
        a few years ago, and rendered fire-proof. Here are preserved some 1,300 manu
        scripts of the highest interest, together with the records of the palace,
        which are kept in patent " Reliance " safes. Some of the documents date from
        a very early time, and one of them, it is alleged, bears the signature of
        Canute. Bishop of Lincoln), the editor of " Camden''s Britannia," who was
        some time vicar of Lambeth, and also librarian here. This catalogue is de
        posited in the manuscript library. In 17 18 it was fairly copied by Dr. Wilkins,
        in three folio volumes, and has been continued by his successors to the present
        time. In 1873-4 the whole of the books and manuscripts underwent a complete
        repair, by a special grant from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. THE CHAMBER
        IN LAMBETH PALACE IN WHICH THE LOLLARDS WERE CONFINED, It may be added that
        the archbishop allows the library to be open to students, and, indeed, to
        all respectable persons, on application, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
        during the year, vacations excepted. Among the " curiosities " of Lambeth
        Palace preserved in the manuscript-room is the habit of a priest, consisting
        of a stole, maniple, chasuble; cord, two bands marked P, and the corporal;
        also a crucifix of base metal, a string of beads, and a box of relics. Here
        also is kept the shell of a tortoise, believed to have lived in the palace
        gardens from the time of Laud (1633) to 1753, when it perished by the negligence
        of the gardener ; the shell is ten inches in length, and six and a half inches
        in breadth. Before quitting the hall, we may remark that a stone on the building
        gives the date of the erection 1685 ; but a leaden pipe attached to the walls,
        running from the roof to the ground, to carry off rain-water, bears the date
        1663. The pipe appears to be in a very good state of preservation ; and a
        coat-of-arms, supposed to be that of Bishop Juxon, can be plainly observed
        on it. To account for the difference in date, it is supposed that the pipe
        belonged to an old building which stood on the site of the present structure.
        From the south-east corner of the hall a flight of stairs leads up to the
        Guard-chamber; it is a large state room, fifty-six feet long by twenty-seven
        feet wide, and is so called from having formerly contained the armour and
        arms appropriated to 277', 1]

    - ["THE ARCHIEPISCOPAL LIBRARY. Lambeth Palace.) 431 library of bookes of divinity,\
        \ and of many odier sorts of learning,\" provided they bound themselves to\
        \ the necessary assurances for the continuance of such books to the archbishops\
        \ successively ; other- wise, they were to be bequeathed to the \" publique\
        \ library of the University of Cambridge.\" Bancroft's successor \u2014 Archbishop\
        \ Abbot (1611-33) \u2014 carried out these injunctions, and left his own books\
        \ to the Lambeth library. But the civil war marked the crisis in the history\
        \ of the collection, for when the Parliamentarians were about to seize on\
        \ Lam- beth Palace, the learned Selden, fearing the danger of total dispersion,\
        \ suggested to the University of Cambridge their right to the books, in accordance\
        \ with Bancroft's will, as above mentioned. Very few of Archbishop Laud's\
        \ books are here, nearly all of them having been presented to the library\
        \ of St. John's College, Oxford. To Cambridge the Lambeth books were transferred\
        \ and preserved, until, at the Restoration, they were recalled by Archbishop\
        \ Juxon (1660-3). That primate's death occurring before the books could be\
        \ restored, it was left to his successor, Archbishop Sheldon, to see them\
        \ replaced at Lambeth. This primate pre- sented many books to the library\
        \ ; but not so his successor, Archbishop Sancrost, who, although he had many\
        \ of the MSS. re-bound and preserved, yet on his resignation presented his\
        \ collection to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, of which he had been master.\
        \ From Archbishop Tillotson (1691-5) we hear of no bequests ; but his successor,\
        \ Arch- bishop Tenison, bequeathed a portion of his library to Lambedi, a\
        \ part to St. Paul's Cathedral, and tne remainder to the library which he\
        \ had founded in St. Martin's-in-the-Fields.* From 1716101757, when the see\
        \ of Canterbury was filled by the primates Wake, Potter, Herring, and Hutton,\
        \ few additions were made ; but Archbishop Seeker, who followed next in order,\
        \ will be gratefully remem- bered in the library annals as having given all\
        \ the books in his own library, which included also many interesting pamphlets,\
        \ to the archiepiscopal collection. To Archbishop Cornwallis we are in- debted\
        \ for presenting and causing the extensive collection of tracts to be bound\
        \ and arranged. The names of Archbishops Manners-Sutton (1805-28) and Howley\
        \ (1828-48) are associated with large bequests of theological lore to the\
        \ library. The great hall was converted to its present use by Archbishop Howley\
        \ in 1834, previously to which time the books were arranged in some galleries\
        \ over the cloisters which were then standing. The bequests of successive\
        \ primates are generally dis- tinguished by their arms or initials on the\
        \ outside cover of the books, while autographs and memoranda on the title-pages\
        \ record noted names, and supply links of ownership. Among those autographs\
        \ may be found the names of Cranmer ; Foxe, the \" mar tyrologist;\" Tillotson\
        \ ; Tenison ; Henry Wotton, the well-known writer on architecture ; the more\
        \ famous one of Charles I., attached to a \" Life of Archbishop Laud ;\" and\
        \ several of less note. It is in this way that the interest of the books is\
        \ iden tified with much that is historical. An exhaustive catalogue of the\
        \ library and art treasures in the palace, with a full description of its\
        \ illuminated manuscripts and ancient chronicles, was published in 1873 by\
        \ the Archbishop's librarian, Mr. S. W. Kershaw. Space does not admit of our\
        \ entering at any great length into a description of the varied contents of\
        \ this library; but we may state that among the ancient printed books is one\
        \ of great rarity : this is \" The Chronicles of Great Britain,\" and was\
        \ printed by Caxton at Westminster in 1480. There are about five other works\
        \ printed by Caxton in the library, although imperfect. The \" Golden Legend,\"\
        \ printed by the celebrated. Wynkyn de Worde, also finds a place here ; as\
        \ also does the \" Nuremberg Chronicle \" (the library had two copies), and\
        \ the fifteenth century MSS., known as the \" St. Alban's Chronicle.\" Of\
        \ illuminated MSS., there are about thirty examples of the various styles\
        \ of art in this library ; one of the most rare being the little MS. known\

        \ that name in Jackson County, he used his influence and succeeded in having\

        \ mistress of Lord Sandwich, who was shot by her lover, Hackman, the clergyman,\
        \ served her time with a mantua maker in St. George's Court, Albion Place.\
        \ A pleasant memory of those delightful old en gravers, the Bewicks, is also\
        \ associated with St. George's Court; for here, about 1780, lived a book seller\
        \ named Hodgson, for whom they worked. In the same obscure yet honoured locality\
        \ also lived that sturdy old antiquary, Dr. Thomas Birch, the son of a Quaker\
        \ coffee-mill maker, of Clerken well. Birch eventually, after being usher\
        \ to Mr. Besse, a Quaker in St. George's Court, took orders in the Church\
        \ of England, and married the daughter of a clergyman. Lord Hardwicke patronised\
        \ him, and in 1734 he became domestic chaplain to the unfortunate Jacobite\
        \ Earl of Kilmarnock, who, joining in the luckless rebellion of '45, was be\
        \ headed on Tower Hill. In 1743 he was presented to the united rectories of\
        \ St. Michael, Wood Street, and St. Mary Staining. He worked much for Cave,\
        \ and was killed by a fall from his horse, near Hampstead, in 1760. He bequeathed\
        \ his valuable library and manuscripts to the British Museum, and the residue\
        \ of his small property to increase the salaries of the three assistant librarians.\
        \ \" Upon Thursdays repair to my palace, and there Aylesbury Street, close\
        \ by, is so called because in bygone times the garden-wall of the house of\
        \ the Earls of Aylesbury skirted the south side of the thoroughfare. Aylesbury\
        \ House was probably a name given to part of the old Priory of St. John, where\
        \ the Earls of Elgin and Aylesbury resided about 1641. Robert Bruce, second\
        \ Earl of Elgin, who lived here in 167 1, was a devoted Cavalier, and an ardent\
        \ struggler for the Restora tion, and was made Earl of Aylesbury in 1663 by\
        \ that not usually very grateful king, Charles II. , to whom he was privy\
        \ councillor and gentieman of the bedchamber. At the coronation of that unto\

        \ staff, eight pounds /line ounces in weight, and supposed by credulous persons\
        \ to contain a piece of the true cross. The earl died in 1685, the year he\
        \ had been appointed Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household. Anthony a Wood\
        \ sums up the earl as a good his torian and antiquary, a friend to the clergy,\
        \ and a \"curious collector of manuscripts.\" Hobble up stair by stair, but\
        \ I pray you take care That you break not your shins by a stumble ; And without\

        \ Ward, describes these plea sant Thursday evening concerts, which, he says,\
        \ were as popular as the evenings of the Kit-Cat Club. Thomas Britton, in\
        \ his blue frock, with a measure twisted into the mouth of his sack, was as\
        \ much respected as if he had been a nobleman in disguise. \" Britton,\" says\

        \ to meet at the shop of one Christopher Bateman, a bookseller, at the corner\
        \ of Ave Maria Lane, Paternoster Row, Britton, who had usually completed his\

        but not yet returned, three. Number of books taken from the library since
        its founda tion neither charged nor returned, four, or less than one for each
        year. In 1872, the trustees adopted a card system of drawing, instead of a
        plan, in which this library was almost alone, of going to the shelves and
        drawing for oneself, thereby keep ing the books in better order, by less handling.
        Blank cards were furnished, free of cost, to every one eligible to the library
        ; the method of using them was very simple, and was explained by the librarian.
        It was advisable for families to provide themselves with the published catalogues
        and addendas, which were obtained of the librarian at a merely nominal charge.
        From these, or from manuscript catalogues found in the reading-room, selections
        were made. For variety, for scope, for value, either in the range of the more
        strictly entertaining and transient, or in that of a standard and permanent
        literature, our library will favorably compare with that of any town of an
        equal population, and in which a similar library has been sustained for an
        equal length of time. The number of volumes in the library at this date is
        two thousand six hundred and seventy-three. Added dur ing the year, two hundred
        and seventy -four volumes ; taken out within this time, ten thousand one hundred
        and thirty two volumes, by six hundred and seventy-six persons; num ber of

        delay was occasioned in their action, and yet the result showed that such
        delay was wisdom and economy in the end. The reading-room, provided for by
        the terms of the donation, was first opened to visitors January 28, 1867,
        while the library, owing to the delay above alluded to, and in procur ing
        cases, preparing books for circulation, and other inter ruptions, was not
        made accessible to the public until April 24. The operations of both departments
        of the institution during the first year were in a high degree satisfactory,
        having more than equaled the most sanguine expectations of those charged with
        their immediate oversight. Under the accommodating and careful management
        of Mr. White, the librarian, both seem to have been centres of increasing
        interest to visitors, and the number of those who are dis posed to avail themselves
        of such means of entertainment and culture is rapidly enlarging. Records kept
        by the librarian for a few weeks after the reading-room was opened, showed
        that an average of twenty-six persons made it a daily resort for reading,
        which is perhaps not an over estimate of the number of those who have continued
        to frequent it, even since the library with its more varied and substantial
        treasures of information has been competing with it for popular favor. Here
        are at all times to be found the leading monthly, and several of the popular
        weekly publications of the country, whose racy and instructive con tents deserve,
        and would doubtless receive, far more attention from many, especially ladies,
        if its location was more retired and favorable for the legitimate use and
        purposes implied in its name. To many who have had occasion to resort to it,
        either for reading or study, it is manifest that other and larger accommodations
        are, to say the least, very desirable. A space equal to that now given to

        the case, the merchandising business was not classified, but each store kept
        a stock of general merchandise, not so extensive in quantity as in variety.
        Dry goods, clothing, boots and shoes, harness, saddles, plows, groceries,
        hardware, and all departments of the mer chandise business, was conducted
        in the one house. Mr. A. A. Cargill is the veteran merchant in town, and the
        only one of the pioneer merchants who has continued in business ever since
        and is now so engaged, as the senior member of the firm of Cargill k Swing,
        in an extensive dry goods, groceries, boots and shoes, occupying three separate
        rooms on the corner of Main and Chestnut streets, C. Hume, another pioneer
        of the town, commenced business in 1858, but for several years of the intervening
        time since, was out on a farm, but is now engaged in the agricultural implement
        trade, east of the C. & A. Railroad, on the corner of Mason and Chestnut streets.
        S. D. Swing, now retired, still lives in town, but for a number of years has
        been out of active business. Dr. A. R. Cooper was the first resi dent physician
        in town, and built and occupied the house now owned and occupied by R. Proctor,
        near the La Forge Elevator. Travis k Brown built the first steam grain elevator,
        of which mention has before been made. Propst & Cottrell opened the first
        drug store in the brick building on the corner north of the St. Nicholas Hotel,
        who was succeeded by Drs. Patterson & Conover, they by Dr. J. S. Walker, and
        he by Kincaid & Bradley, who moved it from that place to the brick building
        now occupied in the business by Allen Bradley. Hume k Warnock built the drug-store
        room now occupied by Dr. W. A. Dunn, on Chestnut street, who bought it of
        Smith & Strbme a few years ago. The drug store owned by Johh H. Hopkins, on
        the corner of Main and Chestnut streets, was built for that purpose in 1871,
        and has been so used ever since. N. Cottrell opened the first picture gallery
        in town, up-stairs over the Propst & Cottrell drug store, in 1860. Before
        that, he traveled about in a car from place to place, and made pictures of
        the old-style daguerreotype pattern. The next was by Eld. J. M. Haughey, in
        the upper story of the old Keefer store building. Mr. Haughey was then the
        Pastor of the Baptist congregations in this vicinity, and often supplemented
        the matrimonial knot by taking a picture of the happy pair. Next in the picture

        results of happiness, if carried out, are illustrated by trite comparisons
        drawn from common life and general experience. The Chinese seldom refer to
        the vengeance of the gods or future punishment, as motives for reform, but
        to the well-being of individuals and good order of society in this world.
        Examples of this standard of human perfection, fully developed, are constantly
        set bes^p the people in Confucius and the ancient kings he delineates. The
        classical tenets require duties that carry their own arguments in their obedience,
        as well as afford matter of thought, while the books of the Budhists and Rationalists
        are mostly filled with solemn nonsense. Consequently the priests of those
        sects had only the superstitious fear of the people to work upon where reason
        was at fault, and so could not take the whole man captive ; foi his reason
        accorded with the teaching of the classics as far as they went, and only took
        up with divination and supplication of higher powers where their instructions
        ceased. The govern ment, therefore, being composed chiefly of such people,
        educated to venerate pure reason, could not be induced to take the initia
        tory step of patronizing a religion of such an uncertain character, and confessedly
        inferior to what they already possessed. The current has, more or less, always
        set this way, and the two superstitions been tolerated so far as they did
        not interfere with government. It is too true that the instructions of Confucius
        and his school are imperfect and erroneous, and the people can never emerge
        from selfish atheism an4 silly superstition as long as they have nothing better,
        but the .paries of the Budhists neither satisfy the reason nor reprove vice,
        nor does their celibate idle ness benefit society. If the former be bad, the
        latter is confes sedly worse. The sect of the Rationalists, or Tau kia, was
        sounded by Lautsz'' or Laukiun. He was born b. c. 604, in the kingdom of Tsu,
        now Hupeh, 54 years before Confucius, and is believed to have had white hair
        and eyebrows at his birth, and been carried in the womb eighty years, whence
        he was called Lau-tsz'', the "old boy," and afterwards Lau-kiun, the " venerable
        prince." According to Pauthier, who has examined his history with some attention,
        his parents were poor, and after entering mature years, he was ap pointed

        night, a member of the ministerial association addresses the club, which meetings
        are also well attended. The Red-Ribbon Choir, composed of George Robertson,
        Leader ; Mr. Vin ton, Organist ; George Robertson and Charles Zerr, Soprano
        ; Dr. P. Davis and J. H. Dryden, Bass ; J. Ross Robertson, Alto, and Bert.
        Tracy, Tenor, furnish the music for the meetings. Among the earnest workers,
        aside from those mentioned above, are Mr. and Mrs. H. Scott Howell, Mr. and
        Mrs. George Robertson, Mr. and Mrs. Col. Sullivan, Mr. and Mrs. Dr. Davis,
        Rev. John Burgess, Rev. Thomas Stephen son, Peter Brown, Erie J. Leech, J.
        A. M. Collins, Dr. A. J. Wilkinson, I. Lynch, Mrs. Stackhouse, Mrs. Ed. Vansant,
        Mrs. Washington, Mrs. De Pugh, Mrs. Bert Tracy, and a host of others. The
        work has resulted in building up many happy homes where formerly were poverty,
        unhappiness and distress. The work is going bravely on. The arrests for drunkenness
        are becoming less and less frequent. The Jail and Calaboose are both empty,
        and in a few months the more enthusiastic temperance workers expect to be
        ,able to have posted on the doors of the Calaboose and Jail, " To Let." WHITE-RIBBON
        CLUB. The organization of the White-Ribbon Club dates with that of the Red
        Ribbon Club. It is under the management of lady temperance workers, and has
        been the direct means of much good. The Club has a large and hand somely arranged
        and handsomely decorated hall and reading-room, on Fifth street, between Main
        and Johnson, which is open every day, Sundays excepted, from 2 to 1G o''clock
        P. M. Since the organization of the Club, it has been the practice to assign
        three of its members to the care of the hall each week, but it is now proposed
        to employ a permanent Librarian, to whom its management will be confided.
        At the time of the organization of the Club, the membership numbered 853.
        It subsequently increased to over one thousand, but since, from various causes,
        the number has decreased to about the original number. The officers of the
        Club consist of a President, one Vice President from each church rep resented
        and one Vice President at large, Treasurer and Secretary. First officers :
        President, Mrs. H. Scott Howell ; Vice Presidents, Mrs. O. Clemens, Mrs. D.
        Collier, Mrs. Libbie Leighton, Mrs. Dr. Collins, Mrs. Washington, Mrs. 0.
        S. Conklin, Mrs. L. B. Cowles, Mrs. Thomas Allyn, from the churches, and Mrs.
        W. A. Patterson, at large; Secretary, Miss Sadie E. French ; Treasurer, Mrs.

        may publish or collect; and to aid in all respects as may be within its province,
        to develop the his tory of this State in all its departments." At that time
        the sum of $3,000 per annum for two years was appropriated. The society is
        under the man agement of a board of Curators, consisting of one member appointed
        by the governor from each congressional district, and of nine additional members
        elected by the society. The officers consist of a president, secretary, treasurer
        and librarian. RAILROADS. In May, 1854, the first rail was laid in Iowa, at
        or near high water mark on the bank of the Mississippi, in the city of Davenport.
        That year the road was completed to Iowa City, a distance of about 54J miles.
        The first loco motive in Iowa was landed at Davenport in July of the same
        year, and was called the "Antoine LeClaire." The road was then called the
        Mississippi & Missouri Railroad. The first rail was laid at Keokuk, on what
        was then called the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines & Minnesota Railroad, on the 9th
        day of September, 1856, and in October of the same year two locomotives for
        the road were landed at Keokuk from a barge which arrived from Qnincy. They
        were called the "Keokuk" and the "Des Moines." In the meantime several lines
        of railroad had been projected to cross the State from points on the Mississippi.
        On the 15th of May, 1756, an act of Congress was approved making a grant of
        land to the State to aid in the construction of railroads from "Burlington
        to the Missouri river, near the mouth of Platte river ; from Davenport, via
        Iowa City and Fort Des Moines to Council Bluffs; from Lyons northeasterly
        to a point of intersection with the main line of the Iowa Central Air Line
        Railroad, near Maquoketa thence on said main line, running as near as practicable
        on the forty-second parallel across the State to the Missouri river, and from
        Dubuque to a point on the Missouri river at or near Sioux City. The grant
        embraced the sections designated by odd numbers six miles in width on each
        side of the four roads named. Where lands had been sold the State was authorized
        to select other lands equal in quantity from alternate sections or parts of
        sections within fifteen miles of the lines located. The law provided certain
        conditions to be observed by the State in disposing of the lands to the railroads
        for which they were granted. In consequence of this grant the governor called
        a spe cial session of the General Assembly which convened at Iowa City in
        July of that year, and on the 14th of the same month an act was approved accepting
        the grant, and regranting the lands to the railroads named, on certain speci
        fied conditions. The roads, with the exception of the Iowa Central Air Line,
        accepted the several grants, and located their lines before April 1, 1857,
        that being a stipulation in the act of July 14th. The lands granted to the
        Iowa Central Air Line road were again granted to the Cedar Rapids & Missouri
        River Railroad Company. The act of Congress making this grant named no companies,
        but designated certain lines, in aid of which they should be', 1]

        \ Deak Sir, \u2014 Having a little leisure, I wish to fulfil my promise of\
        \ giving you some facts and anecdotes prior to the battle of Lexington, which\
        \ I do not remember to have seen in any History of the Ameri can Revolution.\
        \ In the year 1773, I was employed by the Selectmen of the town of Boston\
        \ to carry the account of the Destruction of the Tea to New York ; and afterwards,\
        \ 1774, to carry their despatches to New York and Philadelphia for calling\
        \ a Congress; and afterwards to Congress sev eral times. *In the fall of 1774\
        \ and winter of 1775, I was one of upwards of thirty, chiefly mechanics, who\
        \ formed ourselves into a committee for the purpose of watching the movements\
        \ of the British soldiers, and gaining every intelligence of die movements\
        \ of the Tories. We held our meetings at the Green Dragon tavern. We were\
        \ so careful that our meetings should be kept secret, that every time we met\
        \ every person swore upon the Bible that they would not discover any of our\
        \ transactions but to Messrs. Hancock, Adams, Doctors Warren, Church, and\
        \ one or two more. About November, when things began to grow serious, a gentleman\
        \ who had connections with the Tory party, but was a Whig at heart, acquainted\
        \ me, that our meetings were discovered, and mentioned the identical words\
        \ that were spoken among us the night before. We did not then distrust Dr.\
        \ Church, but supposed it must be some one among us. We removed to another\
        \ place, which we thought was more secure ; but here we found that all our\
        \ transactions were commuuicated to Governor Gage. (This came to me through\
        \ the then Secretary Flucker; he told it to the gentleman mentioned above.)\
        \ It was theu a common opinion, that there was a traitor in the Provincial\

        ticket, with the privilege of voting with the association. Mrs. Alice L. Taylor
        served as Librarian during the first two months. The duties of this office
        are still performed in the same way, various members of the Association serving
        in rotation for terms of two and three months each. Comparatively few cash
        donations have been added to the original list. The association popularly
        known as the Ladies'' Library Association has kept its treasury replenished
        by dint of social, literary, musical and dramatic entertain ments. During
        the first year they made a loan of $300 as the nucleus of a permanent fund
        ; owing to the pressure of the times, they have been able as yet to add but
        $200 to this fund. The number of subscribers has at no time brought in more
        than $150 per year. For 1878, the proceeds of the sale of tickets fell considerably
        short of this meager sum, although the number of vis itors and of those reading
        in the Library materially increased. The Library opened with 2,200 books ;
        the Library Committee report for October 1, 1878, the whole number of volumes
        as 2,816. The report for the year, ending with October, 1878, was : Whole
        circula tion of books going out of the Library, 1,645 ; fiction, 1,141 ; history,
        biog raphy and science, 298 ; essays, 113 ; visitors, 4,254 ; persons using
        reading room, 1,952. The officers for the year 1878-79 are as follows : President,
        Mrs. A. S. Marsh ; Vice President, Mrs. A. C. Woolson ; Corresponding Secretary,
        Mrs. C. T. Cole; Recording Secretary, Miss Sallie Porter; Treasurer, Mrs.
        Callie S. Marsh ; Library Committee, Miss Rachael Carney, Mrs. S. Saunders,
        Miss Lola Goan ; Entertainment Committee, Mrs. Alice L. Taylor, Mrs. J. S.
        McGregor, Mrs. Belle A. Mansfield. It is sincerely to be hoped that so beneficent
        an institution, and one reflect ing so much credit upon its projectors, may
        soon be placed upon such a liberal basis as will make it free and permanent,
        which result could at least be approx imated, if not fully achieved by the
        appropriation of the small tax allowed by the laws of the State. THE MUSEUM.
        In the original Constitution of the Ladies'' Library Association, there was
        a provision for both a library and a museum, but no Museum Committee was appointed
        until 1878. This committee, when appointed, invited Prof. J. M. Mansfield
        to take charge ofthe collection and arrangement ofthe work, his well-known
        excellence as a scientist eminently fitting him. for that task. Pub lic invitations
        were given through the newspapers to every one at home and abroad to bring
        in minerals, fossils, plants, animals and industrial and art products. The
        local papers kept the cause before the people from week to week, which aroused
        a species of enthusiasm especially among the younger members of society, and
        the result was a surprising progress from the very outset. Ardor begets ardor,
        and the spirit with which Prof. Mansfield undertook and pursued his labors
        aroused a corresponding interest in others, and as he made his wants definitely
        known, by way of explicit appeals through the press, any one who had a desire
        to aid in the matter knew just what was desired, and thus the assistance rendered
        was, as a rule, concise and available. Many scien tific specimens were at
        once sent, and these have been added to continually. The plan of the Museum
        is that it shall act as an educator, and not be merely a resort for seekers
        of curious sights. It is free to all to study in, and to take part in building
        it up. The desire on the part of its conductor is to find at home persons
        so interested in the various departments of science that', 1]

        A. Mansfield. These eleven ladies constituted the first Executive Board, consisting
        of President, Vice President, Corresponding and Recording Secretaries, Treasurer,
        and Library and Lecture Committee, the latter two consisting of three members
        each. Mrs. Charles T. Marsh was made first President. They commenced with
        a fund of $360, the net proceeds of a previous lect ure course. They resolved
        to attempt to raise by an active canvass for donations of money and books
        a sum not less than $5,000. In case this sum could not be reached, they proposed
        to use $3,000 as an invested fund, the income of which should be a permanent
        provision for a librarian. For several weeks, the ladies kept up a vigorous
        canvass, proving themselves most importunate beggars. The result fell far
        below their hopes, being only about $2,000, including several conditional
        subscriptions, not immediately avail able. The largest sum subscribed and
        paid was $100, and the sums ranged from that amount to 50 cents. Notwithstanding
        their disappointment in the amount raised, the ladies deter mined to go on
        in their preparations for a library, relying upon the voluntary service of
        members as librarians, until they could do better. Accordingly, they proceeded
        to lease for five years their present quarters, a partially furnished hall
        in Ambler''s Block, second floor, east side of the public square, at $150
        per annum. They provided cases, reading-desks and other fixtures necessary
        for a small beginning. They took possession of the hall January 1, 1876, and
        from that date have laid claim to a " local habitation and a name." They first
        secured the gift of a former collection, popularly known as the " Chamberlain
        Library," amounting tp about eight hundred volumes. These books had been lying
        for several years in dusty piles in a back room of Ambler''s law office. They
        had all been originally donated to Mr. Chamberlain and con sisted of a medley
        of works of theology, science, travel and Patent Office Reports, with some
        very valuable books of reference. These were transferred to the new quarters,
        cleaned, labeled and arranged. Judge Gillis donated 300 volumes, comprising
        a complete set of Congressional Globes, Colonial records and other valuable
        State documents. Other donations of books were received, amounting in the
        aggregate to over two hundred volumes. The most valuable of these was a complete
        set of Appleton''s American Encyclopedia, from Dr. M. Ranney, of the hospital.
        The Association purchased 870 volumes, partly at second-hand; a few stand
        ard magazines were subscribe 1 for, and quite a number of periodicals and
        papers were donated for the reading tables, and thus the preparations for
        opening went on. During the winter, an earnest effort had been made to secure
        the one-mill tax provided for by the code of 1873 concerning free libraries.
        The matter was kept before the people through the county papers ; a petition
        was circulated and the requisite number of signers secured, and strong hopes
        were felt that the measure would be carried at the March election. The City
        Council, however, decided not to submit the question, and the ladies turned
        away disappointed, but resolved to try again at some future time to give to
        Mount Pleasant a free public library and reading-room. The Library was first
        opened for the circulation of books, April 8, 1876, and from that time to
        the present has been open every Tuesday and Saturday afternoon and Saturday
        evenings, the reading tables and books of reference being free to all. The
        sum of $3 per annum, or $1 per quarter, was the price fixed for all who desired
        to take books from the room. The donation or pay-', 2]

        \ has been remarked, and perhaps had he been asked which method he preferred,\
        \ the digging in the earth round ancient monuments to discover their history\
        \ and name, or excavating them from old authors and determining them by skilful\
        \ combinations of otherwise unintelligible passages, he might have preferred\
        \ the second method. . . . The Abbate Fea was verily not a comely nor an elegant\

        \ anti- quity, not the less valuable because yet coated with the dust of years,\
        \ or a medal still rich in its own oxidization. He was sharp and rough, and\
        \ decisive in tone as well as dogmatic in judgment. If one went up to him,\
        \ rather timidly, at his usual post, to request him to decipher a medal at\
        \ which one had been poking for hours, he would scarcely deign to look at\
        \ it, but would tell you at once whose it was, adding, perhaps, for your consolation,\
        \ that it was of no value. It seems, therefore, hardly wonderful that even\
        \ the last year, dedicated naturally to the tercentenary commemoration of\
        \ William Shak spere, should have passed over without any public eulogy of\
        \ his greatness in this metro polis. It seemed, indeed, as if the magnitude\
        \ of that one man's genius was too oppressive for this generation. It was\
        \ not, I believe, an undervaluing of his merits which produced the frustration\
        \ of efforts, and the disappoint ment of expectations that seemed to put to\
        \ rout and confusion, or rather to paralyze the exertions so strenuously commenced,\
        \ to mark the year as a great epoch in England's literary history. I believe,\
        \ on the contrary, that the dimensions of Shakspere had grown so immea surably\
        \ in the estimation of his fellow-coun trymen, that the proportions of his\
        \ genius to all that followed him, and all that surround us, had grown so\
        \ enormously in the judgment and feeling of the country, from the nobleman\
        \ to the workman, that the genius of the man oppressed us, and made us feel\
        \ that all our multiplied resources of art and speech were unequal to his\
        \ worthy commemoration. No plan proposed for this purpose seemed adequate\
        \ to attain it. Nothing solid and permanent that could either come up to his\
        \ merits or to our aspirations seemed to be within the grasp either of the\
        \ arts or of the wealth of our country. A contrast to him in externals was\
        \ an- other priest whose learning was as various, though of a totally different\
        \ class, the Abbe Francesco Cancellieri. I remember him com- ing to pay his\
        \ annual Christmas visit to the rector of the college, an octogenarian at\
        \ least, tall, thin, but erect, and still elastic; clean and neat to faultlessness,\
        \ with a cour- teous manner, and the smiling countenance that can only be\
        \ seen in one who looks back serenely on many years well spent. He used to\
        \ say that he began to write at eighteen and had continued till eighty; and\
        \ certainly there never was a more miscellaneous author. The peculiar subjects\
        \ of which he treats, aud even the strange combinations in their very titles,\
        \ are nothing compared with the unlooked-for matters that are jumbled and\
        \ jostled together inside. Few would have thought of writing a volume on \"\

        \ he got weary of them before the expiration of a third ; and thus the engagement\
        \ very rarely lasted for half a year. The consequence, however, of this multifarious\
        \ life was that he knew a little of everything knowable, and something of\
        \ everybody in England. He passed, upon twenty subjects, for a very learned\
        \ man amongst people who knew nothing at all about them ; in mathematics he\
        \ had crossed the ass's bridge, peeped into the angles of a parallelogram,\

        \ blue and crimson. The feature was the more important, because his nose was\
        \ the only thing about Mr. Falcon that seemed to flourish. His person was\
        \ a precise antithesis to his wife's: a shilling pamphlet on Poor Laws by\

        \ that even in Leinster only the four shires of Dubbn, Meath, Kildare, and\
        \ Louth partially acknowledged the jurisdiction of the crown of England. The\
        \ great lords of the Anglo-Norman descent, as the Earls of Kildare, of Desmond,\
        \ and of Ormonde, absorbed their revenues in their own districts, where they\
        \ administered justice, jealously excluding the king's officials. Some of\
        \ the chief branches of the Anglo-Norman families repudiated the authority\
        \ of England, and confederated with the Irish ; but, when it suited their\
        \ ends, they asserted rights uncler English law, and seldom failed to obtain\
        \ charters of pardon through the interest of their influential kinsmen. \"\

        \ of some highly picturesque figures in the annals of Ireland. The other labours\

        \ many years. His death occurred in 1851. From about the year 1845 till 1852\
        \ or 1853 a minister by the name of Palsgrove was pastor, but the congregation\
        \ had begun to decline under the troublous discords of those times, and finally\
        \ disbanded altogether. Rev. Aaron Warner, then pastor at Wash ingtonville,\
        \ occasionally preached at Jerusalem church, and finally, by a year's regular\
        \ supply, succeeded in reorganizing the congregations in 1858. About the year\
        \ 1825 a society was organized at East Fairfield which entertained the doctrines\
        \ of the \" Primitive Christians,\" and worshiped according to the forms of\
        \ that body several years. It had among its members persons belonging to the\
        \ Crozer, Fisher, Ferrall, Cunningham, Morlan, Wallahan, and other families.\
        \ They built a meet ing-house on a lot which now forms a part of the cemetery,\
        \ west of the village of East Fairfield. In this church Revs. Jones, Seachrist,\
        \ and other Christian ministers preached, and about 1827 Rev. Joseph Gaston\
        \ became the pastor. John Ferrall and William Cunningham were elected to perform\
        \ the office of deacons. During 1859 a man by the name of Roemer was pastor\
        \ for a number of months. In 1860 the pastorate of the still lamented James\
        \ Rinehart commenced. He brought together the scattered members and imparted\
        \ to the Re formed Church an impulse the power of which is felt to this day.\
        \ In 1867 the Reformed people bought out the interests of the Lutheran congregation\
        \ in the church built in 1822, and during the following year, by many sacrifices\
        \ and prayers, erected a handsome brick edifice, with base ment, which is\
        \ used by the congregation at the present time. In February, 1828, Revs. Walter\
        \ Scott and J. G. Mit chell, missionaries of the Disciples' Church, held a\
        \ series of meetings which produced many conversions and caused the society\
        \ to adopt the tenets of the Disciples, all but six of the members voting\
        \ to make the change. Rev. Joseph Gaston continued as minister, and the deacons\
        \ be came elders. Dr. Fisher was appointed deacon. The present elders are\
        \ Aaron C. Baker and L. W. Morlan ; the deacons are Henry Morlan and W. C.\

        \ have been Revs. Gaston, Saunders, Campbell, Lanphear, Baxter, Way, Reeves,\
        \ Moss, Hillick, Hayden, and Callahan. The so ciety has about 140 members\
        \ and a flourishing Sunday school, of which Frederick Heacock is superintendent.\
        \ In 1870, Mr. Rinehart closed his pastorate, and his life, after having been\
        \ permitted to see, during the winter, a wonderful work of grace in his church,\
        \ which resulted in the addition of 70 persons. Rev. Henry Hilbish served\
        \ the congregation from the fall of 1870 to the winter of 1871-72. During\
        \ his pas torate the church was constituted a pastoral charge by itself. In\
        \ June, 1872, Rev. John M. Kendig took charge of the church, aud served it\
        \ with great acceptance and success till September, 1878. His ministry was\
        \ blessed with a steady growth in interest and numbers. The present pastorate\

        \ with reference to Sunday-school work in the earlier years of Grace church\
        \ is that, in 1833, Peter Dehoff was superintendent. In May, 1866, Mr. Binehart,\

        \ of Salem and began preaching to crowded audiences in the old Baptist church,\
        \ still standing on Range Street. In January and February, 1849, efforts were\
        \ made, which proved futile, to unite with the First Baptist church. The society\

        \ among the many converts a few who could not conscientiously agree with their\
        \ Baptist brethren. A number of these, headed by Robert P. Phillips, organized,\
        \ in 1828, a church of the Disciples, known as the \" Phillips' church in\
        \ the township of Salem\" Others in Salem and its vicinity who were in sympathy\
        \ with the movement, became members of that church. Many of the early preachers\

        \ or by a resumption of the regular duties of a church society, but no final\
        \ action was taken. Efforts were made to keep the church in active condition,\
        \ but with little success, and on Feb. 8, 1867, in accordance with a published\

        \ to me, perhaps to each other. We began to move pretty fast, when I asked\
        \ avith some surprise, avhether there were none to inform us what the curiosities\
        \ were as we went on ? A tail, genteel young man in person, who seemed to\
        \ be our conductor, replied with some avarmth, 'What! would you have me tell\

        \ and were silent. No a-oice was heard but in whispers. The history and the\
        \ object must go together ; if one is wanting, the other is of little value.\
        \ I considered myself in the midst of a rich entertainment, consist ing of\

        \ possession of Montagu House, the trustees immediately laid out between twenty\
        \ and thirty thousand pounds on necessary repairs and alterations. The Museum\
        \ avas opened to the public for the first time on January 15th, 1759. The\
        \ establish ment then consisted of three departments only, devoted respectively\
        \ to printed books, manuscripts, and natural history. That the Museum was\
        \ highly appreciated, even in the earliest stages of its exist ence, may be\
        \ easily imagined when we say that Northouck(i772), describing it when first\
        \ founded, styles it \" the wonder of all that beheld it, and confessed, all\
        \ things considered, to be superior to any other Museum in the avorld I !\

        \ to those avhich are still observed at the Soane Museum, in Lincoln's Inn\
        \ Fields* \u2014 namely, it was provided that \" admis sion\" to such \"studious\
        \ and curious persons\" as are desirous to see the Museum should be obtained\
        \ by means of printed tickets, to be delivered by the porter, upon their application\
        \ in writing, which avriting shall contain their names, condition, and places\
        \ of abode, also the day and hour at avhich they desire to be admitted. This\
        \ list was to be submitted every night to the principal Librarian, or in his\
        \ absence, to another officer of the Museum, avho, if he considered the parties\
        \ admissible, was to \" direct the porter to deliver tickets to them according\
        \ to their said request, on their applying a second time for the said tickets,\"\
        \ observing, hoav ever, that not more than ten tickets were delivered for\
        \ each time of admission.\" The parties who pro duced these tickets were to\
        \ be allowed three hours for their inspection of the Museum, spending one\
        \ hour in each department, and being taken in charge by a different officer\
        \ for each. Hovv these regu lations operated in some instances may be learned\
        \ from the account of a visit which was paid to the Museum by Mr.. William\
        \ Hutton, the historian of Birmingham, on the 7th of December, 1784, which\
        \ he described in his \" Journey from Birmingham to London,\" published in\
        \ the following year. He says, \" The British Museum justly stands in the\
        \ first class of rarities. I avas unwilling to quit London without seeing\
        \ what I had many years wished to see, but how to accomplish it avas the question.\

        \ that the door, contrary to other doors, would not open avith a silver key\

        \ afterwards the printing was sus pended, and one of the objects of the Royal\
        \ Commission of 1847 was to inquire into the cause of this suspension. The\
        \ commission approved of the step which had been taken, for the reasons assigned\
        \ by Mr. Panizzi, that it was evidently unadvisabie to print any portion of\

        \ this decision has been arrived at, the revision of the old catalogues has\
        \ continued in manuscript, while all the fresh books added have been dealt\
        \ avith on the same principles ; but, as has already been stated, the number\
        \ of volumes in the Museum before the year 1839 was about 235,000, while the\
        \ number since added exceeds 335,000, so that the bulk of the supplements,\
        \ had the catalogue been printed, would in 1859 have already exceeded that\
        \ of the principal. The immense labour expended on this gigantic work would,\
        \ perhaps, have been more highly appreciated by the public, had some of its\
        \ results been embodied in print. The know ledge and care required in settling\
        \ the items of an extensive catalogue might often win a reputation if exerted\
        \ in some other direction, but apparently will never in England win a reputation\
        \ in this. cases outgrew the number of twelve, he abandoned even this system\
        \ for a worse, and instead of proceed ing in succession with the 'five good\
        \ Emperors,' arbitrarily introduced Cleopatra and Faustina. At the Advocates'\
        \ Library in Scotland, the presses were patriotically named after the succession\
        \ of the Scottish kings, then the additional presses after the signs of the\
        \ zodiac, &c, till necessity drove them to the adoption of numbers, lest they\
        \ should be compelled to make every new attendant go through a course of the\
        \ sciences before he could find a book. The great problem in the arrange ment\
        \ of a library, avhich is increasing, is so to place every book as it comes\
        \ in, that it may receive a press-mark avhich will never have to be altered,\
        \ and yet to provide that the classes of books shall be kept together ; that\
        \ a new book of travels in Aus tralia, for instance, shall stand with other\
        \ books of travels in Australia, and not with Spanish plays or Acts of Parliament.\
        \ A system of this kind would seem to be peculiarly difficult to establish\
        \ in a library which is increasing at the rate of 20,000 volumes a year, and\
        \ yet at the Museum a plan of extreme simplicity has been adopted, avhich\
        \ is found to answer its purpose. Let us suppose that a room has been built\
        \ avhich contains 100 book cases, each capable of containing 150 volumes,\
        \ and therefore that the room will contain 15,000 volumes in all, but that\
        \ the possessor has 1,000 volumes only to place in it at the outset, intending\
        \ to purchase for the next fourteen years 1,000 volumes a year. It is evident\
        \ that if he numbers his presses from 1 to 100, and proceeds to place his\
        \ several books, the very first few volumes that he marks with a press-mark\
        \ hamper him in a certain degree as to the places of all the others. If he\
        \ assumes that his purchases of books in English history will finally occupy\
        \ a single press, and therefore places an edition of Hume in press 77, and\
        \ occupies press 76 on one side of it with ancient history, and press 78 avith\
        \ the history of France; he may find a year after that his purchases in English\
        \ history have filled press 77, and in French history press 78, and that he\
        \ requires more room for both, but that the only space he has left is in press\
        \ 2, among the Bibles, or in press 99, which is entirely vacant, but stands\
        \ next to the works of Shakespeare. The order which he has endeavoured to\
        \ preserve is therefore spoiled : he must either fill up the vacant spaces\
        \ with incongruous books, or shift the position of a number of them and alter\
        \ the press-marks. The problem will be certain to recur over and over again\
        \ before the room is filled, and each time the remedy will be more hard to\
        \ effect and more wearisome. One simple change of feature 111 the arrangements\
        \ \"When a new book has been catalogued, the next step to be taken with it\
        \ is to place it on one of the shelves in a press, or book-case, that it may\
        \ receive its appropriate 'press-mark,' that is, the indication of its locality.\
        \ At the Museum each press or book-case has a certain number, and the different\
        \ shelves are indicated by the letters of the alphabet. Thus the press-mark\
        \ ' 1,340 a' indicates that the book is placed on the 'a,' or topmost shelf\
        \ of press or book-case 1,340. Nothing can be more simple, yet this simplicity\
        \ is rare. In another library in London, for instance, the system is exactly\
        \ reversed : the presses are marked with the letters of the alphabet, and\
        \ the shelves with numbers ; the consequence is, that as the letters of the\
        \ alphabet are soon exhausted, the librarians have to commence a second series\
        \ by repeating them thus, AA, BB, &c. ; then a third and a fourth on some\
        \ other principle, and long before they have arrived at as high a number as\
        \ 1,340, the system will be found involved in inextricable entanglement. As\
        \ the shelves in any book-case never amount to the number of the letters of\
        \ the alphabet, no difficulty of the kind can occur with them. Yet the system\
        \ of numbering the presses appears to have been slow in suggesting itself\
        \ to librarians in general. Sir Robert Cotton named his book-cases after the\
        \ Twelve C\xE6sars, and in order to find a book it was necessary to remember\

        \ superintendents. Each member of a club is expected to leave his private\
        \ address with the secretary ; but this, of course, remains unknown to the\
        \ outside world, and considerable advantage frequently results from the arrangement,\
        \ inasmuch as it was some years ago determined by a County Court judge, who\
        \ before his elevation to the bench had been sadly annoyed by such visitants,\
        \ that the interior of a club was inviolable by the bearers of writs, summonses,\
        \ orders, executions, and the like. Besides those staple features, news-room\
        \ and coffee-room, the usual accommodation of a club-house comprises library\
        \ and writing-room, evening or drawing-room, and card-room, billiard and smoking\
        \ rooms, and even baths and dressing-rooms ; also a \" house dining-room,\"\
        \ committee-room, and other apart ments, all appropriately fitted up according\
        \ to their respective purposes, and supplied with almost every imaginable\
        \ convenience. In addition to the provision thus amply made for both intellectual\
        \ and other recreation, there is another important and tasteful department\
        \ of the establishment \u2014 namely, the cuisine. So far as the general arrangement\
        \ of the club- houses is concernjjjg^'-one description may serve for the whole,\
        \ as\xA3P^ is little difference between the majority of them. The kitchen,\
        \ cellars, store- rooms, servants' hall, &c, are situated in the base- ment\
        \ of the building. On the ground floor the principal hall is usually entered\
        \ immediately from the street ; in other instances it is preceded by an outer\
        \ vestibule of smaller dimensions and far more simple architectural character.\
        \ At a desk near the entrance is stationed the hall-porter, whose office it\
        \ is to receive and keep an account of all messages, cards, letters, &c, aud\
        \ to take charge of the box into which the members put letters to be delivered\
        \ to the postman. The two chief apartments on this floor usually are the morning-\
        \ room and coffee-room, the first of which is the place of general rendezvous\
        \ in the early part of the day, and for reading the newspapers. In some club-houses\
        \ there is also what is called the \" strangers' coffee-room,\" into which\
        \ members can introduce their friends as occasional visitors. The \" house\
        \ dining-room \" is generally on this floor. Here, although the habitues of\
        \ the club take their meals in the coffee-room, some of the members occasionally\
        \ \u2014 perhaps about once a month \u2014 make up a set dinner-party, for\
        \ which they previously put down their names, the day and number of guests\
        \ being fixed : these, in club parlance, are styled \" house dinners.\" Ascending\
        \ to the upper or principal floor, we find there the evening or drawing room,\
        \ and card-room ; the library, the writing-room. So far as embellishment or\
        \ archi- tectural effect is concerned, the first mentioned of these rooms\
        \ is generally the principal apartment in the building. The writing-room is\
        \ a very great- accommodation to members, for many gentlemen write their letters\
        \ at, and date them from, their club. Upon this floor is generally the committee-room,\
        \ and likewise the secretary's office. The next, or uppermost floor \u2014\
        \ -which, however, in most cases does not show itself externally, it being\
        \ concealed in the roof \u2014 is appropriated partly to the billiard and\
        \ smoking rooms, and partly to servants' dormi tories, the divisions being\
        \ kept distinct from each other. Being quite apart from the other public rooms,\
        \ those for billiards, &c, make no preten sions to outward appearance. As\
        \ to the management of a club household, nothing can be more complete or more\
        \ economical, because all its details are conducted systematically, and therefore\
        \ without the slightest confusion or bustle. Every one has his proper post\
        \ and definite duties, and what contributes to his discharging them as he\
        \ ought is that he has no time to be idle. The following is the scheme of\
        \ government adopted : \u2014 At the head of affairs is the committee of management,\
        \ who are generally appointed from among the members, and hold office for\
        \ a certain time, during which they constitute a board of control, from whom\
        \ all orders emanate, and to whom all complaints are made and irregularities\
        \ reported. They superintend all matters of expen diture and the accounts,\
        \ which latter are duly audited every year by others, who officiate as auditors.\
        \ The committee further appoint the several officers and servants, also the\
        \ several trades people. The full complement of a club-house establishment\
        \ consists of secretary and librarian, steward, and housekeeper ; to these\
        \ principal officials succeed hall-porter, groom of the chambers, butler,\
        \ under butler; then, in the kitchen depart ment, clerk of the kitchen, chef,\
        \ cooks, kitchen maids, &c. ; lastly, attendants, or footmen, and female servants,\
        \ of both which classes the number is greater or less, according to the scale\
        \ of the household. It may be added that most of the clubs distribute their\
        \ broken viands to the poor of the surrounding parishes. With these preliminary\
        \ remarks as to our present club system and the usual arrangements of a club\
        \ house, we will proceed to speak more individually of the clubs which abound\
        \ in Pall Mall. The Guards' Club, which is restricted to the officers of Her\
        \ Majesty's Household Troops, is the oldest club now extant, having been established",

        \ or about the time of the establishment of its gardens in Regent's Park.\
        \ The studio of Mr. Matthew Noble, the sculptor, was formerly in this street.\
        \ \"Yes ! on the great Argyll I often wait At charming Sudhrooke or in Bruton\

        \ his house avas so beset with duns | that, in spite of his seat in Parliament,\
        \ even the I provisions for his family had to be let down the 1 area between\
        \ the railings, as he was afraid to open the front door. Sir N. AV. AVraxall\
        \ tells a capital story apropos of this house and its occupant in that year\
        \ : \u2014 \" Sheridan,\" he writes, \" entertained at dinner here a number\
        \ of the (Whig) opposition leaders, though he laboured all the time under\
        \ heavy pecuniary embarrassments. All his plate, as well as his books, were\
        \ lodged in paaam. Having, nevertheless, procured from the pawnbroker an assurance\
        \ of the liberation of his plate for the day, he applied to Beckett, the celebrated\
        \ book seller in Pall Mall, to fill his empty book-cases. Beckett not only\
        \ agreed to the proposition, but promised to ornament the vacant shelves with\
        \ some of the most expensive and splendid productions of the British press,\
        \ provided that two men, expressly sent for the purpose by himself, should\
        \ be present to superintend their immediate restoration. It avas settled finally\
        \ that these librarians of Beckett's appointment shouliLput on liveries for\
        \ the occasion, and wait at table. The company having arrived, were shewn\
        \ into an apartment where, the book cases being opened for the purpose, they\
        \ had leisure, before dinner avas served, to admire the elegance of Sheridan's\
        \ literary taste, and the magni ficence of his collection. But, as all machinery\
        \ is liable to accidents, so in this instance a failure had nearly taken place,\
        \ which must have proved fatal to thc entertainment. AVhen everything was\
        \ ready for serving dinner, it happened that, either from Berkeley Square,\
        \ avhich we now enter on its eastern side, was built in 1698, and named after\
        \ John, Lord Berkeley, of Stratton, whose mansion and grounds we have already\
        \ described as situated on the north side of Piccadilly. From the rear of\
        \ Devonshire House they extended back to Hay Hill, in the south-east comer\
        \ of the square. In the centre of the square, which contains about five acres\
        \ of ground, are some fine, tall, and shady plane-trees, which impart an air\
        \ of cheerfulness and picturesque ness to the spot. AVithin the enclosure\
        \ there was formerly an equestrian statue of George III., erected by the Princess\
        \ Amelia. The statue, which avas executed by Wilton, stood on a clumsy pedestal,\
        \ and represented the king in the character of Marcus Aurelius. At one time\
        \ this square was the most fashionable locality in London. The houses are\
        \ rather heavy and monotonous in appearance ; and a few link-extinguishers\
        \ may still be seen flanking the doorways, reminding us of the days of sedan\
        \ chairs and cumbrous family coaches. The magnificent mansion standing within\
        \ its garden and gates, which occupies the southern side of the square, and\
        \ has been for four generations the town-house of the Marquises of Lansdowne,\
        \ was originally built by Robert Adam, the architect of the Adelphi, for John,\
        \ Earl of Bute, the favourite Premier of George III. in his early days. It\
        \ was scarcely finished when, in 1762, after an adminis tration of about two\
        \ years, during avhich he had brought the war with France and Spain to a close\
        \ by the Treaty of Fontainebleau, Lord Bute suddenly threw up the reins of\
        \ government, and retired into private life. The act was most unpopular. This\
        \ magnificent residence, just completed and newly occupied, exposed his lordship\
        \ to the most malig nant comments ; and his enemies asserted that he could\
        \ not possibly have erected such a mansion by honest and fair means. They\
        \ concluded, there fore, that he had either received large presents from the\
        \ Court of France for signing the treaty, or had made large purchases in the\
        \ public funds, previous to signing its preliminaries. The accu sation was\
        \ made publicly by others as well as by the pawnbroker's distrust, or from\
        \ some unforeseen delay on his part, the spoons and forks had not arrived.\

        \ directed by a porter, seated in a kind of sentry-box, to a narrow door in\
        \ the lower part of the building. Here a short flight of stone steps, ending\
        \ in a glass door, led to the rooms placed at their disposal, which were narrow\
        \ and quite inadequate. The tables, twenty-six in number, were arranged in\
        \ such a manner as to leave a free passage down the centre and round the sides\
        \ of the room ; chairs were placed for the accommodation of eight readers\
        \ at each table, and, as is the case at the present time, book-stands, pens,\

        \ in 1757, it is ordered, \"That no one be admitted to make use of the Museum\
        \ for study, but by leave oT the trustees, in a general meeting, or the stand\
        \ ing committee ; and that the said leave be not granted for a longer term\
        \ than half a year, without a fresh application.\" It is further ordered,\
        \ \" That a particular room be allotted for the persons so admitted, in which\
        \ they may sit, and read, or write, without interruption, during the time\
        \ the Museum is kept open; that a proper officer do constantly attend in the\
        \ said room, so long as any such person or persons shall be there ; and for\
        \ the greater ease and convenience of the said persons, as well as security\
        \ of the collection, it is expected that notice be given in writing the day\
        \ before, by each person, to the said officer, what book or manuscript he\
        \ will be desirous of perusing the following day ; which book or manuscript\
        \ on such request will be lodged in some convenient place in the said room,\
        \ and will thence be delivered to him by the officer of the said room,\" &c.\

        \ which, at the same time that they have increased the facility of access,\
        \ have in no wise lessened the precautions so necessary for the safety of\
        \ the collection. In Weale's \"London and its'Vicinity Exhibited\" (185 1),\
        \ it is stated that the library contained about 500,000 volumes, and that\
        \ it was visited by aoout 70,000 readers during each year, and that every\
        \ accommodation aa'as afforded in the pursuit of their studies. \"With regard\
        \ to the application for ad- mission as a reader being backed \"by a proper\
        \ recommendation,\" the editor of the above avork considers it so very indefinite,\
        \ as to require, in behalf of the public, some revision on the part of the\
        \ trustees. \" It is left too much to the avill of the librarian,\" he adds,\
        \ \"as to avhom he may, in his temper, think a proper person to recommend.\
        \ My own case may not be singular. In the course of my career as publisher\
        \ I have contributed to the Museum books not far from a thousand pounds in\
        \ value ; yet this public servant negatived my recom- mendation of Mr. Robert\

        having a mean appearance, being low and built of brick, though " it contains
        within," adds the writer, " apartments as spacious and commodious as any palace
        in Europe for state parade." On the marriage of the Prince of Wales (George
        IV.), "a suite of the prin cipal rooms was fitted up in the most splendid
        manner ; the walls of two of the levee rooms being hung with beautiful tapestry,
        then recently discovered with its colours unfaded in an old chest at St. James''s.
        In the grand levee room," adds the writer, " is a bed of crimson velvet, manufac
        tured in Spitalsields. The canopy of the throne likewise is of crimson velvet,
        trimmed with broad gold lace, and embroidered with crowns set with fine pearls
        of great value. This was first used on Queen Charlotte''s birthday, after
        the union of the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, and the shamrock,
        the badge of the Irish nation, is inter woven with the other decorations of
        the crown with peculiar taste and propriety." seemed quite intent, Mr. Barnard
        stole round to the apartment where the king was, and, in obedi ence to his
        Majesty''s commands, mentioned that Dr. Johnson was then in the library. His
        Majesty said he was at leisure, and would go to him ; upon which Mr. Barnard
        took one of the candles that stood on the king''s table, and lighted his Majesty
        through a suite of rooms, till they came to a private door into the library,
        ofwhich his Majesty had the key. Being entered, Mr. Barnard stepped forward
        hastily to Dr. Johnson, who was still in a profound study, and whispered him,
        '' Sir, here is the king.'' Johnson started up, and stood still. His Majesty
        approached him, and at once was courteously easy." The king conversed with
        his learned subject freely and agreeably on the studies of Oxford, the two
        University libraries, the literary journals in England and abroad, the " Philosophical
        Transac tions," Lord Lyttelton''s " History," and other literary topics. Boswell
        continues : " During the whole of this interview Johnson talked to his Majesty
        with profound respect, but still in his firm, manly manner, with a sonorous
        voice, and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee
        and in the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, Johnson showed himself highly
        pleased with his Majesty''s conversation and gracious behaviour." At the south-east
        angle of the old house was an octagonal apartment, which contained for many
        years the cartoons of Raphael (now in the South Kensington Museum). They were
        transferred to Windsor Castle, and subsequently exhibited for a time at Hampton
        Court. The saloon was superbly fitted up as the throne-room, and here Queen
        Charlotte held her'' public drawing-rooms. Thus the mansion remained till
        the reign of George IV., externally "dull, dowdy, and decent; nothing more
        than a large, substantial, and respectable-looking red brick house," as it
        was styled by a writer of the time. Dr. Johnson, on this occasion, was pleased
        to pass a high compliment on the elegant manners of the sovereign. In speaking
        of this interview, the biographer writes : " He said to Mr. Barnard, the king''s
        librarian, '' Sir, they may talk of the king as they will, but he is the finest
        gentleman I have ever seen.'' And he afterwards observed to his friend Langton,
        '' Sir, his manners are those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose Louis
        XIV. or Charles II.''" It was not often that Dr. Johnson condescended to express
        himself so approvingly of anybody, least of all of one whose position was
        one of direct antagonism to his beloved Stuart line ; but we may well imagine
        that even the learned doctor''s head was a little turned by the unexpected
        and flattering marks of condescension which he, so lately a poor and struggling
        man, had received from the King of England. At the Queen''s House, in February,
        1767, when his Majesty had been seated little more than six years upon the
        throne, Dr. Johnson was honoured by George III. with a personal interview,
        as related by his biographers. Boswell tells us that the doctor had frequently
        visited those splendid rooms and noble collection of books, which he used
        to say was more numerous and curious than he sup posed any person could have
        made in the time which the king had employed. " Mr. Barnard, the librarian,
        took care that he should have every accommodation that could contribute to
        his ease and convenience while indulging his literary taste in that place
        ; so that he had here a very agreeable resource at leisure hours. It is remarkable
        that Dr. Johnson should have seen four, if not five, of our sovereigns, and
        been in the actual presence of three, if not four, of them. Queen Anne "touched"
        him; George I. he probably never saw ; but George II. he must frequently have
        seen, though only in public ; George Ill he conversed with on the occasion
        above men tioned ; and he once told Sir John Hawkins that, in a visit to Mrs.
        Percy, who had the care of one " His Majesty having been informed of his occa
        sional visits, was pleased to signify a desire that he should be told when
        Dr. Johnson came next to the library. Accordingly, the next time that Johnson
        did come, as soon as he was fairly engaged with a book, on which, while he

        \ subject of frequent discussion in the public press, since the committee\
        \ of the House of Commons in 1835. Before that time, in 1824, the Rev. Thomas\
        \ Hartwell Home had been appointed to superintend the preparation of a classed\
        \ catalogue ; but in 1834, his labours, and those of his colleagues, had been\
        \ suspended, and the Rea-. Mr. Baber had been directed to draw up plans for\

        \ the Royal Commission. When, after Mr. Panizzi's appoint ment to the keepership,\
        \ the library had been removed from the old to the nevv building, the question\

        \ of George Street and Conduit Street. The interior has been decorated in\
        \ an ecclesiastical style, so far as possible, of late years. Over the altar\
        \ is a fine painting of the Last Supper, ascribed to Sir James Thornhill ;\
        \ it is surmounted by a painted window, said to be of the sixteenth century\
        \ ; but the two ornaments do not harmonise. The window itself is said to have\
        \ formerly belonged to a convent at Malines. The subject is \"The Genealogy\
        \ of Our Lord, according to His human nature, as derived from Jesse through\
        \ the twelve kings of Judah, previous to the Babylonian cap tivity. In the\
        \ centre of the lower part is the figure of Jesse seated ; the roots of a\

        \ Moses and Elias.\" George Street, which dates its erection from the building\
        \ of the square itself, and which, as we have observed above, is similar to\
        \ it in the character of its architecture, passes from the centre of the south\
        \ side of the square into Conduit Street. Of this street the author of \"\
        A New Critical Review of the Public Buildings of London \" remarks that there\
        \ is an inconsistency and a departure from the true rule of taste in making\
        \ it wider at the upper than at the lower end, as quite reversing the perspective\
        \ ; and yet he says that the view down George Street from the top of the square,\
        \ with St. George's Church in the front, is fine, and indeed \" the most enter\
        \ taining in the whole city,\" though it ought properly to end in something\
        \ more attractive to the eye than the shops avhich now stand on the site of\
        \ Trinity Chapel, in Conduit Street. In a somewhat similar strain, but more\
        \ rhapso dical style, Ralph remarks : \" The sides of the square, the area\
        \ in the middle, the breaks of build ing that form the entrance to the vista\
        \ [of George Street], but above all the beautiful projection of the portico\
        \ of St. George's Church, are all circum stances that unite in beauty and\
        \ make the scene perfect.\" For ourselves, we prefer decidedly the view looking\
        \ up the street towards the square, which throws the portico into bold relief\
        \ against the sky. An aj-cending view of a church, too, is almost always preferable\
        \ to avhat may be called a descending view. Till within the last few years\
        \ \u2014 or between the close of the last century and the year 1850, when\
        \ Grosvenor Square was the centre of rank and fashion \u2014 St. George's\
        \ enjoyed a monopoly of \"fashionable\" aveddings, which has passed into a\
        \ proverb. Here Sir AA'illiam Hamilton avas married on the 6th of September,\
        \ 1791, to Emma Harte, afterwards so well knoavn as \" Emma Lady Hamil ton,\"\
        \ the friend of Nelson. Horace AValpole, in announcing the marriage to the\
        \ Miss Berrys, tells them that \" Sir AVilliam has just married his gallery\
        \ of statues,\" alluding to the fact that his wife used to sit as a model\
        \ to artists. Here, too, was married in the year 1839, the Marquis of Douro\
        \ (now Duke of AVellington). The attesting witnesses, whose signatures may\
        \ be seen in the marriage register, are his noble father, the great duke,\
        \ and his three brothers \u2014 all peers of the realm \u2014 the Marquis\
        \ Wellesley, Lord Maryborough, and Lord Cowley. The parish of St. George's\
        \ was \"carved\" out of that of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, and Mr. John Timbs\
        \ says that the site of the church was given by a General Stewart. The fabric\
        \ has been much admired by those who think that style of architec ture appropriate\
        \ for religious edifices. It was built in 1722-4 ; the designer and architect\

        \ each from five to nine tons aveight. Even St. Paul's contains no approach\
        \ to these magni tudes.\" In the tympanum of the pediment there is a group\
        \ of allegorical figures, representing the \"Progress of Civilisation,\" which\
        \ has been thus described by Sir Richard Westmacott, R.A. : \u2014 \" Commencing\
        \ at the western end or angle of the pediment, man is represented as emerging\
        \ from a rude savage state through the influence of religion. He is next personified\
        \ as a hunter and tiller of the earth, and labouring for his subsistence.\
        \ Patriarchal simplicity then becomes invaded, and the worship of the true\
        \ God defiled. Next, Paganism prevails, and becomes diffused by means of the\
        \ Arts. The avorship of the heavenly bodies, and their supposed influence,\
        \ led the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, and other nations to study astronomy,\
        \ typified by the centra! statue, the key-stone to the composition. Civilisation\
        \ is noav presumed to have made consider able progress. Descending towards\
        \ the eastern angle of the pediment is the genius of Mathematics, in allusion\
        \ to science being now pursued on known sound principles. The Drama, Poetry,\
        \ and Music balance the group of Fine Arts on the avestern side ; the avhole\
        \ composition terminating with Natural History, in which such objects or specimens\
        \ only are represented as could be made most effective in sculpture.\" The\
        \ difference of the appearance of Montagu House from that of the Museum of\
        \ the present day is very striking, not only avith regard to the building\
        \ in itself, but also as to its situation, rela tively to the country and\
        \ the town. The old house, as we have shown, remained down almost to the close\
        \ of the last century quite open on the north side, and commanded views of\
        \ the surrounding fields ; avhilst the present edifice, although occupy ing\
        \ the same site, and indeed covering a much larger space of ground, is almost\
        \ completely shut in on three sides by streets and squares which are built\
        \ up close to its avails, so that the only view of the edifice that can be\
        \ obtained is that of the prin cipal, or southern, front in Great Russell\
        \ Street. The new buildings, which avere commenced by Sir Robert Smirke, were\
        \ continued in 1S46 by his brother, Mr. Sydney Smirke ; the walls of old Montagu\
        \ House being removed piecemeal as the new edifice progressed ; the last portion\
        \ of it dis appeared in 1845. fn place of the dull brick avail which separated\
        \ the old house from Great Russell Street, there was erected a handsome iron\
        \ railing, partly gilt. Through this the magnificently enriched front of the\
        \ new building can be surveyed by the passer-by in all its entire length ;\
        \ it presents a re cessed portico and two projecting wings ; and as the edifice\
        \ fronts the south, the play of light and shade caused by the forest of Ionic\
        \ columns with which the whole is faced, is such as no other portico in London\
        \ possesses. At either extremity of the court-yard is a range of houses for\
        \ the resident officials of the Museum. In the centre of the iron railing\
        \ \u2014 which is raised upon a granite curb, and is formed of spears painted\

        \ is the prin cipal carriage-gate and foot entrance, strengthened by fluted\
        \ columns with composite capitals, richly gilt, and surmounted by vases. The\
        \ building erected by Sir Robert Smirke consists of four ranges of apartments\
        \ \u2014 east, avest, north, and south ; and these formerly enclosed a hollow\
        \ square, forming a large open quadrangle. The eastern range, which avas completed\
        \ in 1828, avas in use some years previous to the gradual erection of the\
        \ others. It contains the apartments The style of architecture adopted throughout\
        \ the exterior of the new building is the Grecian-Ionic. The southern fa-cade\
        \ consists of the great entrance portico, eight columns in width, and two\

        \ collection, and also the Royal Library, of avhich we have spoken above ;\
        \ a magnificent series of corridors 300 feet in length, and forty wide, with\
        \ inlaid floors and coffered ceilings. The ground-floor of the northern range\
        \ of apartments is allotted to the general library, and is less ornate in\
        \ appearance than the eastern range ; but it nevertheless contains one or\
        \ two rooms of a striking character. The western range was erected partly\
        \ on the site of the old Gallery of Antiquities, which avas opened in 1807,\
        \ and presents one large apartment, corresponding in length avith the Royal\
        \ Library; this is appropriated to Egyptian and other sculpture. The southern\
        \ range, the last completed, occupies the exact site of old Montagu House.\
        \ This range contains the great hall and staircase; on the east of which is\
        \ a room containing the Grenville library, and on the avest a saloon containing\
        \ sculp tured antiquities. The increasing collections of the Museum had rendered\
        \ it necessary to make various additions to the original design of Sir Robert\
        \ Smirke, some of them even before that design had been carried out. Of these\
        \ may be mentioned a gallery or saloon for the 'Elgin marbles, which was erected\
        \ on the avestern side of the western range. The most extensive addition,\
        \ however, is that erected in the inner quadrangle, under the superin tendence\
        \ of Mr. Sydney Smirke, who had some time previously succeeded his brother,\
        \ Sir Robert, as architect to the Museum. This new building con tains the\
        \ reading-room and the accommodation pro spectively necessary for the annual\
        \ increase of the collection of printed books. It is one of the prin cipal\
        \ architectural features of the Museum, and the only one that is visible at\
        \ a distance, the dome that crowns it forming part of the view of London as\
        \ seen from Hampstead Heath, and from the Norwood and Sydenham hills near\
        \ the Crystal Palace. The approach to the room is by a long passage, which\
        \ is adorned with a bust of Sir Anthony Panizzi, avho was some time principal\
        \ librarian, and at whose suggestion the new reading-room was built. The subject\
        \ had indeed been under consideration many years previously, and some discussion\
        \ has arisen as to the real author of the original sugges tion. Mr. Hawkins,\
        \ an architect, who published a pamphlet of \" Observations on the Reading-room,\"\
        \ in 1858, assigns the earliest notion of building in the above-mentioned\
        \ quadrangle to Mr. Edward Hawkins, in 1S42 ; but the idea seems to have been\
        \ ventilated even as early as the years 1836 and 1837, when it was introduced\
        \ in a series of letters on the Museum, published at that time anony mously\
        \ in the APechanics' APagazinc, but which were subsequently acknowledged by\
        \ Mr. Watts, one of the officers of the Printed Book Department, '\"The space\
        \ thus unfortunately wasted,\" says Mr. Watts, speaking of the quadrangle,\
        \ \" would have provided accommodation for the whole library. A reading-room\
        \ of ample dimensions might have stood in the centre, and have been surrounded\
        \ on all four sides by galleries for the books, communi cating with each other,\
        \ and lighted from the top.\" On crossing the threshold of the reading-room,\
        \ the visitor finds himself in a large circular apart ment crowned avith a\
        \ dome of the most magnificent dimensions, 140 feet in diameter, and 106 feet\
        \ high. It is the largest dome in the world, with one exception, the Pantheon\
        \ at Rome. The cylinder or drum which sustains the dome, presents a con tinuous\
        \ circular avail of books, which are accessible from the floor, or from low\

        \ the \" readers \" about 20,000 volumes of books of reference and standard\
        \ works, and in the part round the galleries more than 50,000 volumes of the\

        \ a large circular-headed window, avith three panels above, the central one\
        \ being medallion-shaped, the avhole bordered avith gilt mouldings and lines,\
        \ and the field of the panels finished in encaustic azure blue, the surrounding\

        \ diameter. The sash is formed of gilt moulded ribs radiating from a central\
        \ medallion, in which the royal mono gram is alternated with the imperial\
        \ croavn. The cornice, from which the dome springs, is massive and almost\

        \ Turner's pictures. \" He avas met at the door by a refusal of admission,\
        \ and avas obliged to make an almost forcible entry. He had hardly gained\
        \ the hall when Turner, hearing a strange footstep, mshed out of his oavn\
        \ particular compartment, and angrily confronted the intruder, 'What do you\
        \ want here?' 'I have come to purchase some of your pictures.' ' I have none\
        \ to sell.' ' But you won't mind exchanging them for some of these?' and he\
        \ took out of his pocket a roll of bank-notes, to the amount of five thousand\
        \ pounds. The Birmingham gentleman was successful, and carried off his five\
        \ thousand pounds worth \u2014 now, perhaps, worth five times that sum \u2014\

        \ replied, ' From Bamstaple.' I have several times mentioned this statement\

        \ where, it is true, he appears to have resided in very early life, avhither\
        \ he must have come from the country. His father was a barber. When Turner\
        \ had a cottage near Twickenham, the father resided with his son, and used\

        \ state of public affairs during the time of the Civil War, is one of great\
        \ interest. It was commenced in 1641, at the very outbreak of the rupture\

        \ St. Paul's Churchyard, who, observing the direction which public affairs\
        \ were taking, and the extraor dinary activity of the pre6s, conceived the\
        \ idea of collecting all the pamphlets and publications on either side, from\
        \ folios to broadsides, as they made their appearance. \" For the twenty years\
        \ following,\" says the author of the article in the \"Encyclop\xE6dia\" already\
        \ quoted, \" though we are told it was a heavy burden to himself and his servants,\
        \ and though at one time it avas thought advisable to effect a colour able\
        \ sale of the collec'.ion to the University of Oxford to save it from the\
        \ Commonwealth, the design appears to have been never relinquished for a day.\
        \ On one occasion, the king himself sent to borrow a pamphlet, and chancing\
        \ to drop it in the dirt, sent a courteous apology to Mr. Thomason, who made\
        \ a memorandum of the circumstance in the volume (one avhich contains Shawe's\
        \ ' Broken Heart ' ) on which the dirt remains to this day to attest the fact.\
        \ The whole collection at last amounted to about 30,000 pamphlets, bound up\
        \ in chronological order, in 2,220 volumes. Ill, indeed, was the collector\
        \ requited. In a statement bound up with his catalogue, and written apparently\
        \ by his son, ave are told that in his lifetime, avhich lasted till 1666,\
        \ he refused for the collec tion, supposing that sum not sufficient to reimburse\

        \ have directed the royal stationer, Mearne, to buy it on his account, it\
        \ is not known for what sum, and afterwards to have granted as a favour permission\
        \ to re-sell it, which the heirs of the Mearne family did not succeed in doing\

        \ support, should \" bring up and instruct in virtue, and good and laudable\
        \ acts,\" one child. But, \" as the present poor people are not capable of\
        \ instructing children, the governors were of opinion that some honest and\
        \ industrious clergyman who has a wife should be nominated and appointed to\
        \ read prayers twice a day in the chapel, and instruct the children.\" Accordingly\
        \ the school was founded, and the first clerical master appointed in 1735.\
        \ In 1793 the pensioners' allowance (originally \xA35 only, and sub- sequently\
        \ \xA315) was increased to ;\xA3i8, and is now fixed at per annum. In 1794,\
        \ the lease of the Brandesburton estate having fallen in, the governors obtained\
        \ an Act of Parliament to \" increase and extend the objects of the charity.\"\
        \ Ten out-pensioners were added to the almshouse branch, and the benefits\
        \ of the in pensioners were increased by the addition of twenty chaldrons\
        \ of coals to their annual pension. In 182 1 the number of children was increased\
        \ from twenty to forty, which number was finally raised to sixty, in 1845,\
        \ when the new schools were erected. In 1846 the chapel was enlarged, by the\
        \ addition of an apex on the west side, to serve the purpose of a chancel.\
        \ Before this time there had been no means of celebrating the holy communion.\
        \ The altar-piece was purchased at the taking down of the church of St. Benet\
        \ Fink, near the Royal Exchange. The pulpit is of elaborately-carved oak,\
        \ and appa rently of the time of James I. Under an arch at the north end of\
        \ the chapel is a small model of the tomb of the founder, Lady Dacre, in Chelsea\
        \ Church. Of the masters of the hospital the only man of eminence was the\
        \ Rev. William Beloe, the trans lator of Herodotus, who retained the office\
        \ from 1783 to 1808, when, he w\xE6 appointed Rector of Allhallows, London\
        \ Wall, and Assistant Librarian in the British Museum. The most valuable endowments\
        \ of this ancient charity consist of the manorial estate of Brandes burton,\
        \ the greater part of which parish belongs to the \" poor of Emmanuel Hospital.\"\
        \ The aldermen of London, as \" trustees of the poor of Emmanuel Hospital,\"\
        \ have been liberal and popular landlords. In 1843 they rebuilt the Brandesburton\
        \ Schools, which had already been founded and endowed by a Yorkshire lady\
        \ in the reign of George I. In 1869 was passed the \"Endowed Schools' Act,\"\
        \ bringing this and other hospital schools under the stern and reforming hands\
        \ of the \" Endowed Schools' Commission.\" In 1873 this commission carried\
        \ in Parliament a \"scheme\" for the recon struction of this hospital, and\
        \ the separation of the schools from the almshouse branch of the charity.\
        \ Under the provisions of this scheme the endow ments of four hospital schools\
        \ in Westminster were to be united under the management of one body of governors,\
        \ viz., Emmanuel, St. Margaret's, Palmer's, and Emery Hill's hospitals. Out\
        \ of these endow ments it was proposed to establish three large middle-class\
        \ schools, namely, a boarding-school, to be erected within twenty miles of\
        \ London, and two day-schools in Westminster, each providing accommodation\
        \ for 300 boys, of whom 200 in each should pay a small sum for their education,\

    - ["MR. TOWNELEY AND HIS \" WIFE.\" 'she British Museum.] 533 In 1874, an addition\
        \ was made to the collection in this gallery, in the shape of fragments of\
        \ columns, bases and capitals, &c, from the Temple cf Diana at Ephesus, avhich\
        \ had been discovered by Mr. Wood, in explorations made during the two or\
        \ three previous years. Among the fragments sent hither by Mr.. Wood were\
        \ \" the lower drum of a column, nearly entire, avith figures sculptured on\
        \ it in relief, and large fragments of two or more drums, similarly sculptured\
        \ ; also the base of a pilaster, sculptured in relief, on the same scale as\
        \ the drums.\" These sculptured drums, it is con sidered, \"are evidently\
        \ portions of the thirty-six columns of the temple, which Pliny describes\
        \ as collates, or 'sculptured in relief \" The architectural marbles present\
        \ many interesting features ; some of the smaller fragments, for instance,\
        \ \"retain traces of red colour; while the calcined surface of other marbles,\
        \ and their charcoal smears, tell the sad story of some ancient conflagration,\

        \ cabinet of gems, and casting a long and lingering look behind at his marbles,\
        \ was about to leave them to their fate, avhen, moved by some irrepressible\
        \ im pulse of affection, he took the bust in question into his arms and hurried\
        \ off with it to his carriage. Fortunately the attack did not take place,\
        \ and his 'wife,' as he called the lady represented, returned to her companions.\"\
        \ Passing on through the Roman Gallery, the last of the series of rooms devoted\
        \ to the department of sculptured antiquities, we arrive once more in the\
        \ entrance-hall, and so end our perambulation of this great national storehouse.\
        \ There is, however, one more object which we should mention, and that is\
        \ the skeleton of, we believe, the largest avhale ever captured. This monster\
        \ of the deep, mea suring some hundred feet in length, was for many years\
        \ an attraction at country fairs throughout the kingdom, a large number of\
        \ caravans being used for its conveyance and exhibition ; and it has at last\
        \ found a resting-place in the basement of the Museum, under the Grenville\
        \ Library, where it can be seen on application to the attendants. A staircase\
        \ in the south-west corner of the building leads into the Gr\xE6co-Roman basement\
        \ room, to avhich the basement of the Lycian Room is annexed. In this room\
        \ are shown figures and reliefs of the Gr\xE6co-Roman period, miscellaneous\
        \ objects in marble and other material, and the collection of tessellated\
        \ pavements and mosaics, avhich has been formed chiefly from the discoveries\
        \ at Carthage and Halicarnassus in 1856-S. It will be evident that the expenses\
        \ of such an establishment as the British Museum must be very considerable,\
        \ and that many persons must be occupied in fulfilling the duties attached,\
        \ to it. We have already spoken of the principal librarian as being head and\
        \ chief, under the trustees, of the whole avorking body of the establishment.\
        \ Besides this officer, there are upavards of one hundred persons engaged\
        \ in the various departments, either as \"keepers,\" or \"senior assistants,\"\
        \ or \"junior assistants , \" and in addition, there is a little army of assistants\
        \ dispersed through the libraries and saloons, perhaps upwards of another\
        \ hundred strong. Then there are a few \" fumatori,\" or cast makers, and\
        \ a regular corps of index-makers and bookbinders, constantly employed, as\
        \ well as a goodly number of household servants. It may, perhaps, be almost\
        \ needless to remark here that every precaution is taken to ensure the safety\
        \ of the collection. Like the Bank of England, this building has a detachment\
        \ of the Guards nightly sent to keep watch and ward against intruders from\
        \ without; whilst the destruction of the edifice by fire is a thing well nigh\
        \ impossible, seeing that no light is allowed to be carried about whatever,\
        \ either by night or by day, and that, through the same fear of fire, all\
        \ night studies are forbidden. We conclude this subject with a few general\
        \ remarks. If we compare it avith similar institutions abroad, such as the\
        \ Bibliotheque Nationale and the Louvre, at Paris, the Royal Libraries of\
        \ Munich The next three rooms, extending along the southern front of the building,\
        \ are known as the Gr\xE6co-Roman Rooms, and are appropriated to statues,\
        \ busts, and bas-reliefs, of quite a mixed class, and mostly of a classic\
        \ character. Here ave find several statues and busts of gods and goddesses,\
        \ such as Hercules, Venus, Bacchus, Pan, and the like ; but ave can here notice\
        \ only a few of them. In an alcove in the centre room is the Towneley Venus,\
        \ found at Ostia, in 1776 ; and in the alcove on the opposite side is the\
        \ celebrated Discobolus, or Quoit-thrower, presumed to be a copy of the famous\
        \ bronze statue made by the sculptor Myron. In the avestern room is the beautiful\
        \ female bust commonly called \" Clytie.\" The bust is repre- sented as emerging\
        \ from the petals of a flower, and it was esteemed by Mr. Towneley as the\
        \ gem of his collection. It was bought at Naples, from the Lorrenzano Palace,\
        \ in 1772. The folloaving curious anecdote connected avith this piece of sculpture\
        \ we quote from Charles Knight's \" London :\"\u2014 \"During the Gordon riots,\
        \ Mr. Toavneley, as a Catholic, avas marked out by the mob, who intended to\

        do in Rilehester ? Did I not hear that the Librarian wanted some copying done
        ? " "We do not want him at Rilehester," said the Dean a httle sharply, "I

        \ house in Grosvenor Street perpetuated, writes Mr. J. Larwood, the well-known\
        \ fable of the \" Wolf and the Lamb,\" which was pictured by a sign repre\
        \ senting a lion and a kid. The house was known as the \" Lion and Goat.\"\
        \ Cologne \u2014 a shield, with a pair of compasses, an axe, and a dray, or\
        \ truck, with goats for supporters. \" In a country like England, dealing\
        \ so much at one time in Rhenish wine, a more likely origin,\" he observes,\
        \ \" could hardly be imagined.\" Mr. Larwood, however, points out that possibly\
        \ the \" Goat \" was the original sign, and that the host afterwards added\
        \ the Masonic \" Compasses,\" as is often done now. At the bottom of Grosvenor\
        \ Place, and reaching to Buckingham Palace Road, is a large triangular piece\
        \ of ground, intersected by a part of Ebury Street, and covered with lofty\
        \ and handsomely constructed houses, known respectively as Gros venor Gardens\
        \ and Belgrave Mansions. On the east side of this triangular plot is Arabella\
        \ Row, one side of which is occupied by the royal stables of Buckingham Palace,\
        \ which we have already de scribed.* This row was once, not so very long ago,\
        \ well tenanted. Among others, here lived Lord Erskine, after he had ceased\
        \ to hold the seals as Lord Chancellor. His lordship, who held them only a\
        \ year, was not only an orator, but a wit, as the following anecdote will\
        \ show : \u2014 Captain Parry was once at dinner in his company, when Lord\
        \ Erskine asked him what he and his crew lived upon in the Frozen Sea. Parry\
        \ said that they lived upon seals. \" And capital things, too, seals are,\
        \ if you only keep them long enough,\" was the reply. One of the houses in\
        \ Arabella Row is the official residence of the Queen's Librarian at Windsor\
        \ Castle. Belgrave Square, into which we now pass, was so named after the\
        \ Viscountcy of Belgrave, the second title of Earl Grosvenor before he was\
        \ raised to his superior titles. It was built in the year 1825, and covers\
        \ an area of about ten acres. It was designed by George Basevi, the detached\
        \ mansions at the angles being the work of Hardwick, Kendall, and others.\
        \ It is nearly 700 feet in length by a little over 600. The houses are uniform,\
        \ except the large detached mansions at the angles. Those in the sides are\
        \ adorned with Corinthian columns and capitals. Belgrave Square has always\
        \ been occupied by the heads of the highest titled nobility, and by many foreigners\
        \ of distinction. Lord Ellesmere lived here till he built Bridgewater House.\
        \ Among other notabilities who have resided here may be named the first Lord\
        \ Combermere, Sir Roderick Murchison, the geologist, Sir Ch.arles Wood, afterwards\
        \ Lord Halifax, and General Sir George Murray, who acted as Quartermaster-General\
        \ to the British army during the Peninsular War. At the south-west corner\
        \ lived for some years another dis tinguished General, Lord Hill, the hero\
        \ of Almarez. In this square the Count de Chambord and his mother held their\
        \ court, during a short visit which they paid to England in 1843. The Austrian\
        \ Embassy has been for several years located in this square. At the corner\
        \ of Arabella Row and Buckingham Palace Road, is a public-house, rejoicing\
        \ in the once common sign of the \" Bag o' Nails \" \u2014 a per version of\
        \ \" The Bacchanals \" of Ben Jonson. \" About fifty years ago,\" writes the\
        \ author of \"Tavern Anecdotes,\" in 1825, \"the original sign might have\
        \ been seen at the front of the house ; it was a Satyr of the Woods, with\
        \ a group of ' jolly dogs,' ycleped Bacchanals. But the Satyr having been\
        \ painted black, and with cloven feet, it was called by the common people\
        \ ' The Devil ; ' while the Bacchanalian revellers were transmuted, by a comic\
        \ process, into the ' Bag of Nails.'\" In Chapel Street, which runs from the\
        \ south-east corner of Belgrave Square into Grosvenor Place, resided Mr. Richard\
        \ Jones, a teacher of elocution, generally known as \"Gentleman Jones,\" who\
        \ is mentioned by Lord William Lennox, and by nearly all the'writers of modern\
        \ London anecdote. Here he used to have scores of pupils practising for the\
        \ pulpit, the bar, or the senate. \" Under his able tuition,\" says Lord W.\
        \ Lennox, \" many a reverend gentleman, who mumbled over the service, became\
        \ a shining light ; many an embryo lawyer, who spoke as if he had a ball of\
        \ worsted in his mouth, became a great orator ; and many a member of Parliament,\
        \ who 'hummed and hawed,' and was unintelligible in the gallery, turned out\
        \ a dis tinguished speaker.\" In Grosvenor Row, a thoroughfare which has dissippeared\
        \ in the march of modern improvements that have recently taken place in this\
        \ neighbour hood, was another inn, \"The Three Compasses,\" well known as\
        \ a starting-point for the Pimlico omnibuses. It was generally known as the\
        \ \"Goat and Compasses\" \u2014 possibly a corruption of the text, \" God\
        \ encompasseth us ;\" though Mr. P. Cun ningham sees in it a reproduction\

        called to the pulpit of the old North Church in Boston. He and Nicholas Sever,

        to change the board, and effect the removal of certain liberal members of

        private residences, and its natural scenery attract the attention of those
        heretofore strangers to its marvellous beauty and to the enterprise of its

        library, supported by general taxation, but the property of an incorporated
        association. The first meeting with a view to the establishment of this institution
        was held at Union Hall on the 22d day of February, 1868, when it was resolved
        and encouraged by the offer of $5,000 for the object, by Hon. J. W. Grimes,
        to organize an association, for the purpose of founding a public library.
        At an adjourned meeting held on the 7th day of March, 1868, Articles of Incorporation
        were adopted and the following-named Trustees elected, viz., C. H. Phelps,
        J. J. Owen, Phillip Harvey, James Putman, William Salter, J. W. White, W.
        B. Chamberlain, J. S. Schramm and J. C. Peasley. Temporary quarters were secured
        in Marion Hall, but the active existence of the library dates from September,
        1868, when 2,000 volumes, presented by Mr. Grimes, were placed upon the shelves.
        After several removals, the Association finally, in Septem ber, 1876, took
        possession of its present very accessible and beautiful room in Mr. S. H.
        Jones'' block, corner of Fourth and Jefferson streets. The number of volumes
        now on the shelves is 6,670, which have cost $9,104.16. The periodicals have
        cost $682.28. The furniture and fixtures have cost $890. The present officers
        of the Association are as follows: J. S. Schramm, Pres ident ; J. C. Peasley,

        in imitation rosewood. A semi-circular gallery runs around the east end of
        the audience-room, in which is a fine organ, and all the appointments of the
        house are such as becomes a temple devoted to the worship of the Almighty.
        In 1869, some additions were made so the edifice, including an extension of
        twelve feet to the main building, and the erection of a steeple ninety-two
        feet high. The house occupies a commanding position, overlooking a large part
        of the city, the river, etc. ; will conveniently seat about seven hundred
        people, and cost $12,000. It was dedicated April 6, 1851, Rev. Christopher

        Kroenlein, of Franklin Center, Iowa, Rev. Conrad Riess, of Muscatine, Rev.
        J. G. Shinn, of the Burlington Presbyterian Church, and Rev. William Salter,
        of the Burlington Congregational Church, assisted at the dedication, which
        was a joyful occasion to the faithful members and friends of the Church. In
        1849, the Church was re-organized by changing some and adding new articles
        to the Constitution, and at present is in a most flourishing condition. Soon
        after the re-organization, the Church was incorporated by an act of the State
        Legislature. The present membership includes the heads of eighty families,
        representing not less than four hundred members in all, including children.
        The Sabbath school connected with the Church has an average attendance of
        about two hundred members, and is accomplishing happy results. The present
        Superintendent is Henry Berges ; Librarian, Louis Blaul. In the basement of
        the church a day school is conducted eleven months of the year, supported
        by private tuition ; present teacher, Charles Grueninger. About eighty pupils
        are now in attendance. There is also connected with the Church a Mutual Aid
        Society, organized in April, 1856. It now has ninety-four members, each of
        whom, when disabled by sickness, receives $4 per week, and at the death of
        any member, his funeral expenses are paid, to the amount of $25, and the widow
        or orphans left by him, receive $300 from the Society. This Church is one
        of the most active and harmonious in the city, and during the many years it
        has been blessed with the ministrations of the present able and worthy Pastor,
        Rev. Mr. Fausel, the society and congregation have greatly increased. German
        Evangelical Zion Church was organized the 13th of March, 1864, with the following
        constituent members : H. Hoelscher, G. H. Biklen, G. Bischoff, S. Magel, F.

        in August. The corner stone was laid August 16, 1864. The present officers
        are: Elders, II. Hoelscher, C. Andre, G. H. Bikler, G. Bischoff, M. Gutekunst

        \ to Rev. L. G. Bell, who came from Tennessee, the honor of first planting\
        \ the Presbyterian Church in Bur lington, in the year named. This organization\
        \ was reported to the General Assembly three years later, with thirty-two\
        \ members, the Rev. John Fulton, stated supply. This organization having adopted\
        \ the Congregational name and form in 1843, it was dropped from the Assembly's\
        \ roll in 1844, and such of the members of the infant organization as were\
        \ not satisfied with the change took measures to effect a new organization.\
        \ In February, 1845, Rev. Dr. Cummins and Rev. William L. McCalla met these\

        \ of No. 1 Engine Company. Ever Ready, No. 2. \u2014 In August, 1856, was\
        \ organized fire company \" Ever Ready, No. 2.\" The company did not receive\
        \ its engine until February, 1857. The first officers were : John Palmer,\
        \ Foreman ; M. P. Cogswell, First Assistant ; W. C. Cook, Second Assistant\
        \ ; H. B. Malone, Secretary and Treasurer. The building in which they kept\
        \ their engine stood on the south side of Bridge street, just west of the\
        \ river bridge. The first fire at which the engine was used was the burning\
        \ of the \" Star \" saloon, which stood where J. L. Perkins' hardware store\
        \ now stands. This fire occurred about the 1st of March, 1857. The membership\
        \ of the company at this time was about eighty. Before receiving their engine,\
        \ the members of the com pany had done very efficient service in line-and-bucket\
        \ work. For about two years, the company occupied quarters in the stone building\
        \ now used by the Herrick Carriage and Wagon Shop. In 1860, the city purchased\
        \ of Ambrose Rouse the lots on which the company's building now stands. A\
        \ frame building was erected, which burned in 1866. This fire destroyed the\
        \ records and the library of the company. In front of the building was set\
        \ a high liberty-pole, which was presented the company by the Fremont Club\
        \ in 1856, and which had stood in front of the old engine house on Bridge\
        \ street. The present engine house was erected in 1868. At the State Fair\
        \ at Janesville in October, 1857, the company won the first prize, a beautiful\
        \ silver trumpet, in a tournament in which were companies from Milwaukee,\
        \ Madison, Janesville and several other places. At Freeport, on the 15th of\
        \ September, 1871, the company won the first prize of $100 for throwing the\
        \ largest quantity of water, and the third prize of $50 for distance. On the\
        \ 4th of July, of the same year, the company won a prize of $100 at Brodhead,\
        \ but without serious opposition. On the 4th of July, 1878, while attending\
        \ a celebration at Freeport, a fire broke out, and No. 2, although in a strange\
        \ city, were first to the spot and had the first stream on. For this promptness\
        \ and efficiency, the press of Freeport expressed the sincerest gratitude\
        \ and highest praise. The present roster of the company is : Foreman, John\
        \ Cunningham ; First Assistant, William English ; Second Assistant, Joseph\
        \ Barnes ; Secretary, Frank Filbert : Treasurer, L. E. Cunningham; Steward,\
        \ Launceston Moses; Librarian, Samuel Smith. The service of the fire department\
        \ at the burning of Winslow & Rosenberg's hardware store, in 1876, was so\
        \ efficient that the city, in reward for the faithfulness of her firemen,\
        \ pre sented the city library, containing about 2,000 volumes. This library\
        \ had been kept in an upper floor of the Winslow & Rosenberg store, and was\
        \ in the property saved by the firemen. In 1859, \" Ever Ready \" had established\
        \ a flourishing library, and it increased to 1,000 volumes. but, in 1866,\

        \ at this point plays a very important part in the \" political economy \"\
        \ of Beloit for on its cool and limpid waters many thousands of dollars are\
        \ garnered in a year by the numerous enterprising firms who have erected upon\
        \ its banks extensive manufactures, whose power is derived from its pellucid\
        \ and steadily flowing stream. It was first heard of in this connection in\
        \ 1843, when, by an act of the Legislature, approved April 1, Ira Hersey,\
        \ A. S. Field and others were authorized to erect a dam across it on any land\
        \ they owned or might own in Section 35 or 26, in Town 1 north, Range 12 east;\
        \ said dam to be four feet above usual low-water mark. In the following year,\
        \ these gentlemen assigned their charter to Mr. James H. Hanchett, who erected\
        \ the dam and controlled the water-power until the next year, when by reason\
        \ of financial embarrassment, he disposed of his interest to Mr. Charles Walker,\
        \ of Chicago. That gentleman thereupon entered into an arrangement with gentlemen\
        \ desirous of manufacturing, by which they were to have the use of the water\
        \ sub ject to a pro rata charge for repairs. This arrangement lasted until\
        \ 1871, when an act was passed by the Legislature, and approved on March 8,\
        \ incorporating the Beloit Water- Power Company, with a capital of $80,000,\
        \ in 800 shares of $100 each, which could be doubled if necessary. The company\
        \ consisted of the following gentlemen: Soreno T. Merrill, Israel Will- iams,\
        \ Charles H. Parker, Gustavus Stone, Frank Koenig, William Blodgett, Orson\
        \ E. Merrill, O. B. Olmstead, Judd M. Cobb, James Gray, Nathan B. Gaston,\
        \ John Bishop and Ebenezer F. Brown. The whole amount of water in the river\
        \ at the dam was assumed to be 13,333J inches. which was divided among the\
        \ different consumers. In 1874. a re-organization of the company was effected,\
        \ every consumer along the river being deemed a stockholder, and about that\
        \ time they entered into an arrangement with the towns of Janesville, Rockton\
        \ and Rockford, by which they obtained a quarter-interest in the waters of\
        \ Lake Koshkonong and the reservoir at Indian Ford. Everything then ran smoothly\
        \ until 1876, when a disagreement occurred among the consumers, some charging\
        \ that others were using more than they were entitled to. That matter was\
        \ soon rectified, however, by the appointment of Mr. Charles M. Messer, who\
        \ divided the water among them by Weir measurement. The actual head is about\

        life in the West, sustained by their mutual affection, till at last, after
        a long life of usefulness and self-sac rifice, Hiram Townsend passed to his
        rest on the 9th day of December, 1870, at the age of seventy-two, universally
        honored and esteemed. His widoBv still survives, residing in Cleveland, on
        the West Side. In addition to his other business interests, he owns stock
        in several important corporations; he has been, and is, a director of the
        Mercantile Insurance com pany, and in March, 1875, was chosen a director of
        the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianap olis railroad company. In
        all the varied positions he has occupied, both in public and private life,
        he has shown the same indomitable energy, clear judgment, thorough information

        resi dence in Greenwich, March 22, 1<:35. He was, from the very first, inured
        to the practical labors of farm life, labors Bvhich no doubt aided largely
        both in de veloping his present muscular and well knit frame, and in giving
        that practical readiness and that power of adapting means to ends, which have
        so thoroughly characterized him throughout his life. His educa tional advantages
        were limited to such training as the country schools of that time afforded,
        except during a feiv months in 1852, when he attended the old Pros pect-street
        grammar school, then under the charge of Mr. L. M. Oviatt, afterwards superintendent
        of the Cleveland public schools and librarian of the public library, of ivhose
        attentive guidance Mr. ToBvnsend has ever since cherished the most grateful

        being descended from the Puritans ivho, as Macaulay says, "prostrated themselves
        in dust before their Maker, but set their feet upon the neck of their king."
        The following genealogy shoivs his lineage in this country. The location of
        the Cleveland, Columbus and Cin cinnati railroad across his father''s farm,
        in 1848, had aroused the ambition of young Townsend, then only thirteen years
        old, to find a wider and more congenial sphere of action than his rural occupation
        had af forded. Beginning in a subordinate position on the railway just mentioned,
        his earnest and constant en deavor was to subserve the interest of his employes
        by unwearying faithfulness to every assigned duty. This trait was soon observed
        by those who could not only appreciate but reward it; and in the spring of
        1856 young Townsend, at the age of twenty-one, through the kindness of E.
        S. Flint and Addison Hills, was transferred from Shelby station to the freight
        office at Cleveland. Samuel Townsend was born in England in 1637, and came
        to this country about the time (1649) when the head of Charles First was brought
        to the block. He settled at Lynn, Massachusetts, aud died there in 1704. His
        son, Jonathan Townsend, was born in 1668, and died at Lynn in 1717. The son
        of the latter, also named Jonathan, was born in 1697, and entered Harvard
        College in 1712. After being gradu ated, he ivas ordained in 1719 as pastor
        of the Con gregational church, at Need ham, Massachusetts, aud died there
        in 1762, after a pastorate of forty-three years; a length of service, especially
        if compared ivith the average modern pastorate, creditable alike to the congregation
        and their evidently trusted minister. In April, 1862, Mr. Townsend was invited
        to a position in the Second National Bank of Cleveland, where he remained
        till 1865, ivlien he Bias tendered the post of superintendent of the Empire
        Transporta tion Co., and assumed the charge of the western department of that
        line. The energy and alility which had characterized Mr. Townsend in every
        posi tion which he had hitherto occupied were, by this time, so fully recognized
        that in August, 1868, he ivas tendered and accepted the offices of director
        and vice president of the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincin nati and Indianapolis
        railroad. When, a few- months afterwards, Mr. L. M. Hubby, the president of
        the company, met with an accident which disabled him from performing the duties
        of his position, Mr. Town send became the acting executive officer, and in
        Sep tember, 1870, at the age of thirty-five, was elected president of the
        corporation. His son, Samuel Townsend, great-grandfather of Oscar, was born
        in 1729, and died at Tyringham, Berkshire county, Massachusetts, in 1822.
        The son of the latter, William Townsend, a youthful soldier at the close of
        tho Revolutionary Bvar, was born in 1765, and died in Huron county, Ohio,
        in 1848. His son, Hiram Toivnsend, father of Oscar, was horn August 31, 1798,
        and removed to Greenwich, Huron county, Ohio, in the spring of 1816, and there
        married Miss Eliza Fancher, on the 23d of April, 1823. It was no pathway of
        roses which opened at that time before the neivly-wedded couple. They saiv
        clearly what was before them, and entered knowingly upon a life of labor and

        \ valued at three hundred thou sand dollars, and actually producing an income\

        \ works in the build ing are most courteously entreated. THE CLEVELAND LAW\
        \ LIBRARY. This institution was founded by the Cleveland Law Library Association\
        \ in 1871, and is located in the court-house. .Since its establishment a law\
        \ has been passed devoting a part of the fines collected in the police court\
        \ to its support, and making it free to all members of the bar. It is still,\
        \ however, under the control of the association. It contains about four thousand\
        \ volumes, many of them of great antiquity and value. This splendid gift has\
        \ of course placed the associa tion out of danger of want, and has enabled\
        \ the di rectors to make large additions to their literary stores. The dues\
        \ have been reduced to one dollar per year. The room occupied by the association\
        \ has been filled to its utmost capacity, with over twelve thousand vol umes,\
        \ some of them very rare and valuable works. A competent force of librarians\
        \ is employed, and is gen erally kept busy in attending to the wants of the\
        \ pub lic. Besides those who loan books, numerous readers are constantly at\
        \ the tables examining books and mag azines. In short, there is little doubt\
        \ that the asso ciation has entered on a long career of prosperity and usefulness,\
        \ which cannot but reflect the highest honor on its munificent friend. From\
        \ the fact that it is located in the Case building, and from the deep im pression\
        \ made by the gift just mentioned, the institu tion is commonly called the\
        \ Case library, though the real name remains as before \u2014 the Cleveland\
        \ Library Association. THE KIRTLAND SOCIETY OF NATURAL SCIENCE. This institution\
        \ was founded and incorporated in the summer of 1869, under the leadership\
        \ of Dr. Jared Potter Kirtland, from whom it was named. In 1870 it became\
        \ a department of the Cleveland Library Association. Its museum is in the\
        \ third story of the Case building. Here may be seen finely mounted specimens\
        \ of beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles and insects from all parts of the country,\
        \ and some from foreign lands; nearly all donated by eminent citizens of Cleveland.\
        \ Among these benefactors are William Case, R. K. Winslow, John Fitzpatrick\
        \ and Dr, Kirt land. Though it lacks the popular interest attaching to the\
        \ library, yet the museum has many visitors, and cannot but exercise a beneficial\
        \ influence. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY. CHAPTER LXIV. The Cleveland Public Library\
        \ was originated in 1853, but did not attain very high standing until 1867\
        \ when the law authorized the board of education to consolidate the old school\
        \ libraries and to impose a tax for the support of a single public library.\
        \ After being located in various rooms, and leasing perma- nent quarters for\
        \ several years in the city hall build- ing, it has at length been established\
        \ in a place ad- mirably suited to its needs. On the removal of the Central\
        \ high school, in September, 1878, to the new structure of Willson avenue,\
        \ the old high-school building on Euclid avenue, near Erie street, was refitted\
        \ and appropriated for the use of the public library, the board of education,\
        \ and other officials of the schools. The second and third stories are devoted\
        \ to the use of the library. It contains twenty-six thousand volumes, mostly\
        \ of a popular character, such as are desirable for circulation among the\
        \ children of the schools and the citizens generally. About three thousand\
        \ valuable scientific and historical works, however, have been placed in a\
        \ room by themselves, from which they are not allowed to be taken, being used\
        \ only for reference. It is intended to add five thousand volumes annually\
        \ to the collection, but the expense of refitting and removing to the new\
        \ quarters has prevented its being done during the present year. The library\
        \ is free to all residents of the city, and THE CLEVELAND BAH Samuel Huntington\u2014\

        \ existence with the location at that point of Samuel Huntington, of Connecticut,\
        \ in the spring of 1801. His practice, however, was of infinitesimal quantity,\
        \ aud it is doubtful whether he had a single case in a court of record, not\
        \ because the people were unwilling to trust him, but because there was no\
        \ business to be transacted. Cleveland, east of the Cuyahoga, (the only portion\
        \ then settled) being a part of Trumbull county, it was almost sixty miles\
        \ in a straight line through the woods to the county seat at Warren, and much\
        \ farther by any practicable route, aud the people were far too poor to seek\
        \ the more expensive kinds of legal redress uuder such difficulties. Mr. Hunting\
        \ ton may have occasionally tried a case before a justice of the peace, but\
        \ that was nearly or quite the sum of his practice. He plunged into politics,\

        \ of the book, my riding record lacked more than 3600 m. of justifying the\

        \ until Sept. 10, when (landing in Boston from my Nova Scotia tour ; see p.\
        \ 292) I called on the president of the Pope Mfg. Co., and talked the matter\

        \ for such a road-book as I roughly outlined to him, or that its circulation\
        \ would greatly help the cycling trade. He said that more than four years\
        \ had been required for working off 4000 of Pratt's \"American Bicycler,\"\
        \ though a large proportion of these had been given away (to newspaper writers,\
        \ librarians and others), for the sake of dispelling popular igno- rance about\
        \ the machine, \u2014 a function now not much needed in a new book. However,\
        \ in spite of his slight enthusiasm, he would be willing to favorably consider\
        \ any definite proposition I might make him when I got the prospectus of mine\
        \ fairly formulated. This happened three months later (Dec. 3), and I then\
        \ proposed that he buy at half-price 2000 copies of the $1 subscription- book\
        \ therein described, \u2014 paying $500 for the first 1000 on publication-day,\
        \ which must be within a year from date, and $500 for the second 1000 within\

        \ president again at the Springfield tournament, I told him that I could not\
        \ bring out the book within the specified time, and that, instead of being,\
        \ as first planned, an affair of 300 pp. (capable of being manufactured, say,\
        \ for 25 c. a copy), it was likely to be so large as to leave no decent margin\
        \ on a contract at half the subscription- price. So, by mutual consent, our\
        \ agreement was abrogated. I said I should probably offer him another chance,\
        \ later on, to make money as a bookseller; but I did not do so in fact till\
        \ June 3, '86 ; and I am glad, for reasons given hereafter, that he then declined\
        \ it. (See p. 711.) n* 1 . r My prospectus said, \"The publication of the\

        \ gave no hint of the fact, now first proclaimed, that double that number\
        \ had previously been pledged for at half-price. I hope I may make the truth\
        \ clearly understood that the chief value to me of this preliminary pledge\
        \ was a moral value ; for, in the absence of it, I should probably never have\
        \ printed the prospectus at all. My feeling was that the Popes ought, as business\
        \ men, to feel a thousand-fold the interest which any individual rider might,\
        \ from mere sentiment, feel in the success of such a scheme ; and that, unless\
        \ I had the ability to persuade them to risk $1000 on it, I could not wisely\
        \ assume the ability to persuade 1000 private men to each risk $1.", 1]

        \ chance ; but, as I suppose there is about one man in 100 small enough to\
        \ think that the offered gift of $250 was designed to fetter me in some way,\
        \ I would refuse it on his account, if for no other. In similar spirit, let\
        \ me confess for the benefit of any one who thinks my praises of ihe Lamson\
        \ luggage-carrier may have been influenced by my accepting from the inventor\
        \ thereof a free sample of each variety, that I did so accept them (for they\
        \ were tendered to me under such circumstances that a refusal would have amounted\
        \ almost to rude ness), though I paid for the third specimen which I now have\
        \ in use. As regards my widely advertised opinion of it, as \" the best thing\
        \ of the sort ever devised,\" the date, '82, ought prop erly to be attached,\
        \ \u2014 for several other good devices have since come into the market, and\
        \ I do not pretend to know anything against their comparative merits. At the\
        \ outset of my Kentucky tour, in 'S2 (p. 225), another acquaintance of mine,\
        \ with whom I had \" shared my last lemon,\" two years before (p. 109), insisted\
        \ upon attaching to one of my spokes a specimen of the Mc- Donnell cyclom.,\
        \ for which he was the agent, \" in order that I might give it a fair test\
        \ with the Pope cyclom. on my axle.\" The test proved its worthlessness ;\
        \ but I have often recommended the McDonnell, since then, because of its low\
        \ price and because of its maker's willingness to exchange defective specimens\
        \ until a good one is finally found. If any one thinks my action in this respect\
        \ has been affected at all by the worthless gift of 'S2, I grant him the liberty\
        \ of that opinion. I specify these two examples, trivial though they seem,\
        \ in order the more impressively to declare that I have taken no other gifts\
        \ of any sort. Whatever things I have wanted in bicy cling, I have bought\
        \ and paid for ; and such -pther things as have been tendered to me I have\
        \ respectfully declined. I have twice offered to test new styles of cyclometers,\
        \ and publicly report my careful observations (and I hereby make the offer\
        \ a general one) ; but the two makers did not consent. A third style I tested,\
        \ at the maker's request, and then returned it to him as unsatisfactory, though\
        \ accurate. I am conscious, therefore, of no other motive or inspiration than\
        \ a simple desire to tell the truth, in any words of praise or blame which\
        \ I have printed in this book. In statements of fact, I have tried to be colorless,\
        \ and I have suppressed nothing. In references to machines, I have mentioned\
        \ the maker whenever known to me. In quota tions from journals, I have given\
        \ date and page. In all cases where a record of full name, address and price\
        \ seemed appropriate or useful , I have taken pains to freely advertise the\
        \ same. a \u25A0\u25A0- , j.. , 7 ,, My refusal to admit paid advertisements\

        \ this book solely in their interest, I rely upon it to give them a sort of\
        \ feeling of personal pride as \" copart ners\" in the production of a volume\
        \ whose handsome typography is unmarred by such vulgari ties. By proving how\
        \ my subscription scheme has been carried through without any sort of subsidy\
        \ from \" the trade,\" and how slight my hope is of help from the same in\
        \ pushing future sales, I trust this truth has been shown : that the main\
        \ chance of any reward coming to me, from three years' work and risk, now\
        \ depends upon the amount of good-will and enthusiasm which the book may be\
        \ able to arouse in its 3000 subscribers. I have served as their self-ap pointed\
        \ agent in doing a thing which no one else in the world had power to do; and,\
        \ if they shall decide that it was worth doing, I am confident they will individually\
        \ take pleasure in help ing ensure the enormous sale now needed to pay me\
        \ for thus serving them. By exhibiting the volume to librarians, hotel-keepers\
        \ and cycling acquaintances, they may advertise it in a more effective way\
        \ than would be possible by any expenditure of printer's ink. I do not intend\
        \ to sell through the bookstores, for the price has been put too low for the\
        \ payments of commissions to middle-men, but I shall bend all my energy to\
        \ the pursuit of direct buyers through the mails, \u2014sending contents-table,\
        \ preface and other specimen pages to thousands of cyclers. I shall also print\
        \ for them \" opinions of the press and of subscribers \" ; and this intention\
        \ forms one of several reasons why 4 shall be glad to have any one write to\
        \ me just what he thinks of the book, or of any part A it. I ask every such\
        \ private reviewer to say what his preference is, \u2014 in case I publish\
        \ any of his remarks, \u2014 as regards attaching to them his full name and\

        the ornaments of which the town is proud, a costly gift to the public from
        the late Mr. William Atkinson, D.L., J.P. It was opened February 21, 1878,
        by Mr. Alderman Nicholson, the then Mayor. A composite Italian structure designed
        by Messrs. Waddingfon and Son, Burnley ; it was built at a cost of by Messrs.
        Neill and Sons, Manchester, and is in every respect an admirable and remarkable
        building. The orna mental sculpture of the front elevation is very fine, a
        carved medallion is over the doorway ; and there are allegorical groups in
        six large panels. To the right on entering is the newspaper room, plainly
        and comfortably furnished, and on the opposite side is the periodical room
        and reference department. The lending library faces the doorway, and the collection
        is in appropriate fittings. On the floor above are five galleries with a hanging
        space of 6,000 feet. Periodical exhibitions are held, to which the most eminent
        artists send their pictures, and the Town also possesses an excellent permanent
        Art Collection, which is open free of charge. Mr. T. Newman is the librarian.
        THE SCIENCE AND ART SCHOOLS. An important addition to the public buildings
        of Southport is now in course of completion. We allude to the Science and
        Art Schools which have been erected at the back cf Cambridge Hall, and which
        will shortly be opened. A separate entrance is obtained between the Cambridge
        Hall and the Atkinson Art Gallery, but admission may be gained for students
        and others from a short street leading from Eastbank Street. The rooms in
        this building are very spacious, and are so constructed that a Museum', 1]

        \ organized. John A. Hantzsch was elected provisional Captain of the company\
        \ ; J. J. Heller, Captain first department ; W. Cook, Captain second department;\
        \ F. Frenzel, Captain third department. The fourth department was filled by\
        \ the rifle company, who volunteered to supply the place. Soon after this\
        \ the company, out of personal funds, provided hooks, ladders, and tin buckets.\
        \ September 20, 1857, the company was recognized, and incorporated by the\
        \ town authorities, in conformity with the provisions of the amended charter\
        \ of that year. In August, 1859, a hook and ladder wagon was purchased. With\
        \ these few appliances the company got along for nearly three years more,\
        \ then $225 was raised, partly by subscription, to purchase a small hand-engine.\
        \ This was bought in Mil waukee, and arrived here on the 21st of April, 1862.\
        \ Then the company for the first time felt that they were prepared to render\
        \ really efficient service. The balance of the money needed to pay for the\
        \ engine was raised by giving a picnic in Stingle hammer's grove. The company\
        \ also purchased a lot for their use this spring (1862), and succeeded in\
        \ persuading the town authorities to build an engine-house. A few years subsequent,\
        \ the village purchased a large hand-engine, and various equipments, from\
        \ the Madison Fire Department, costing about $1,200, so that now, considering\
        \ the needs of the place, the company is very fairly provided for. The company\
        \ has on all occasions given evi dence of willingness to do and has, through\
        \ its exertions, has saved a good deal of valuable property at different times.\
        \ About the first house saved was J. J. Heller's, in May, 1862. In 1867, Mr.\
        \ Hoffman's house, now the Catholic priest's dwelling, was saved. Very soon\
        \ after the company succeeded in putting the fire out at Lenz's brewery. While\
        \ Viedt & Lachmund were keep ing store where Van Eschen now is, on May 2,\
        \ 1875, the building caught on fire and was saved. When the fire of June 3,\
        \ 1877, broke out, and burned Charles Nebel's store, erected in 1851, and\
        \ William Phillips' and Nick Truckenbrodt's buildings, south of the old Astor\
        \ House first known as the Leibig house, the fire company managed to save\
        \ the hotel, which is yet standing, and Mr. Conradi's drug store. Taken all\
        \ in all, the record of the company is first-class. Societies and Churches.\
        \ Singing Society. \u2014 German social life is never complete without social\
        \ singing, or singing societies ; and nothing conduces more to harmony of\
        \ feeling than engaging in evoking the almost divine harmonies of sound that\
        \ have been evolved by the master minds in music during past ages. Germany\
        \ is the land of great composers, and where the people are all lovers of the\
        \ sublime art, and her sons and daughters, wherever we find them, still maintain\
        \ the national excellence in this particular. When the first gathering for\
        \ social singing was convened here, no one can tell, but doubtless at a very\
        \ early day ; and even the exact date when a permanent organization was formed,\
        \ cannot be given, as the Secretary's books were burned in Trucken brodt's\
        \ fine hall three years ago. However, the society is about twenty-six years\
        \ old, being one of the oldest in the State. The first members were, as nearly\
        \ as can be ascertained, Robert Morsback, John Klutch, Edward Rendtorff, Max\
        \ Stinglehammer, H. Schlegelmilch, Edward Kuehn, Theodore Schramm and D. Heick.\
        \ Robert Morsback was Leader. There are now forty-six members, twenty-five\
        \ of whom are singers, the remainder being passive members. Charles Naffz\
        \ is Leader. The present officers are H. Schlegelmilch, President ; Max Stingel\

        particulars concerning his family-and early history. He entered the British
        military service as an ensign in the Fifty-third Regiment of Foot, on Febru
        ary 10, 1770, at which date the regiment was doing garri son duty in Ireland
        under the command of Colonel John Toovey, an officer of distinction in the
        British army. In this capacity he served until April 1, 1773, when he was
        promoted to the rank of lieutenant, which was his rank when hostilities commenced
        between Great Britain and her North American colonies. On the 4th of April,
        1776, Digby embarked from Ireland with his regiment under Major- General Burgoyne
        for the relief of Quebec, and shared in the perils attendant upon the expulsion
        of the Americans from Canada during that year; and through the winter which
        followed was stationed at Chambly. In the spring', 1]

        In 1759 this fort was captured by the British and Provin cials, under General
        Amherst, and was taken from them by the Americans, under command of Colonel
        Seth Warner, in May, 1775, there being at this time a garrison of but twelve
        men in the fort. between the Iroquois and the Hurons, in which he took part
        so unwarrantably in the summer of 1609. From immemorial time it had served
        as the gateway between the vast tribal regions of the south and those of the
        north. Here, so well suited was the place for a defensive post, Montcalm,
        in 1756, built his fort, and, with " the poet''s tongue of baptismal flame,"
        called it Carillon, on account of the music of the waterfall near by, which
        reminded him of a chime of bells. But the sweet voice of the waterfall was
        drowned by the harsh din of battle in 1758, between the English and French.
        In this battle, the English under Abercrombie were defeated. The next year
        Amherst laid siege to and captured it. For sixteen years it remained in the
        possession of the English, when Ethan Allen, in 1775, took it from the English,
        who retook it in 1777, but were soon forced to part with it. In 1778 it was
        again taken by General Haldeman, but was soon abandoned to the Americans.

        broken, and although he denied any such intention, and even offered to re-affirm
        them by the signatures of his officers if desired so to do, he was not listened
        to, but Congress resolved that these words indicated his intention and afforded
        " just grounds of fear," that he would " avail himself of such pretended breach
        of the convention, in order to disengage him self and the army under him of
        the obligations they are under to these United States ; and that the security

        Court of Great Britain."49 This requirement, Congress must have Spofford,
        the librarian of Congress, and by it we see what General Gates considered
        " a good method " of delaying, " if not final preventing " the fulfillment
        of the terms of the con vention. He says " It has occurr''d to me, that should
        Sir William Howe still Obstinately refuse to settle an equitable Cartel, for

        so singularly successful in governing the Greater Britain that occupies so
        large a share of the world''s surface ; whilst they, themselves, have been
        systematically denied the privilege of ruling in the land of their birth.
        It is a strange and strik ing anomaly that Ireland should be the only place
        on the face of the earth where Irishmen are not permitted to govern. History
        shows how Irish governors have been mainly instrumental in building up and
        consolidating the colonial empire of Britain, and yet, during the currency
        of the nineteenth century, Ireland has never had a viceroy chosen from her
        own distinguished sons. Englishmen and Scotchmen have been regularly sent
        to govern a nation that supplied rulers to every quarter of the civilised
        globe. Carrying coals to Newcastle were wisdom in comparison with this, and

        in the agita tion for separation from the parent colony, and very soon after
        the successful issue of that contest, when the settle ment became an independent
        colony, he was elevated to the bench of the Supreme Court, and creditably
        filled that high position for the long period of twenty-nine years. One of
        Sir Eedmond''s ardent admirers has recorded that one of his first actions
        on arriving in Melbourne was the " founding of a reading club for working
        men. There were few books in the settlement, and no place where a poor man
        could have easy access to books or magazines. Barry set aside a room in his
        house as a little lending library, on the shelves of which stood Frazer''s
        Magazine, Blackwood, Cornhill, &c, and a small selection of standard works.
        Here the working man of the neighbourhood could look in and select his book,
        no doubt having at times to listen patiently to one of those elaborate little
        addresses, in which Mr. Barry was fond of pouring out floods of inconceivably
        out-of-the-way erudition ; but those who came in contact with him, all had
        the same impression of him, as a man who took a pleasure in seeing folks around
        him happy, even though it should be at the expense of some little discomfort
        to himself. This little institution is interesting as having been the means
        of sug gesting the great library which he afterwards proposed and helped to
        found." The Melbourne Public Library now ranks among the great libraries of
        the world. It has a collection of 150,000 volumes and 20,000 pamphlets. All
        the year round it is open from ten in the morning until ten at night, and
        the average attendance of visitors is 1,000 per day. The present librarian

        Richard," and in drinking the health of Gainsborough, toasted that artist,
        with pointed emphasis, as " the best landscape-painter in England," on which
        Wilson rejoined, " Yes, and the best portrait-painter, too." Wilson was himself
        one of the founders of the Royal Academy, and became its second librarian.
        At first he painted portraits, but while he was in Italy, Zuccarelli and Vernet
        encouraged him to believe in his own genius for landscape ; and, as Allan
        Cunning ham says, " he found himself better prepared for this new pursuit
        than he imagined : he had long been insensibly storing his mind with the beauties
        of natural scenery ; and the picturesque mountains and glens of his native
        Wales had been to him an academy when he was unconscious of their influence."
        The story, however, of his life is sad and depressing. The love of landscape
        was not then what it is now. Moreover it does not, like portrait-painting,
        make any appeal to vanity. While Wilson lived in London, many of his pictures
        went wet from the easel to the pawnbroker''s, and he is said to have painted
        one for part of a Stilton cheese and a pot of porter. He was conscious, however,
        of his own powers. He said once to Sir William Beechey, "You will live to
        see great prices given for my pictures : " and this estimate has been justified.
        When he was now an old man, the legacy of a small estate on the Alyn, and
        the opening of a vein of lead, placed him in affluence. But it was too late.
        On one of his favourite walks, near Colomendy, he sank exhausted : his sagacious
        dog brought servants to his aid ; but he never recovered. He is buried at
        Mold. His memory is pre served at Colomendy by the sign of the " Three Loggerheads,"
        two only being exhibited in the picture by Wilson, the third being the visitor
        who looks at them. There is a better memorial still in his view of the valley
        of the Alyn, as seen from the Bwlch, near Mold. To this must be added, on
        the present occasion, a picture of the Dee, taken from a well-known point
        of view not very far below the point where the tributary joins the main river.',

        \ as assiduous clerical life, he adopted journalism instead. He has been connected\
        \ with the Continen tal, the Irish, and the American press, and it may be\
        \ said that for a man of his years he has written a great deal and written\
        \ well. In March, 1885, he was expelled from Paris, with the ex-Fenian chieftain,\
        \ James Ste phens, at the request of the British Ambas sador, Lord Lyons,\
        \ and he then took up his residence in Lausanne, Switzerland. A col lection\

        \ and Other Poems.\" as he, and savored with twice his length of years for\
        \ study. It might almost be said that there was nothing in the history of\
        \ Ireland which he did not know. Prior to 1842, when the Dublin \"Nation\"\
        \ was estab- lished as the organ of a pronounced national party, the existence\
        \ of his marvellous tal ent for reaching the Hearts of the people through\
        \ the medium of verse had not been suspected even by himself. He became a\
        \ member of the \"Nation\" staff, and wrote Davis, Francis. Cork's large brotherhood\
        \ of poets includes some of the boldest and most valuable of the vigorous\
        \ articles which gave its columns a character never before known in Irish\
        \ Francis Davis, who introduced himself in literature as the \" Belfast Man.\"\
        \ He was born in Ballincollig, Cork, March 7, 1810, but in early manhood he\
        \ settled in Belfast, where be learned the trade of a weaver. Many of His\
        \ poems were written while he worked at the loom, but he also wrote sev eral\
        \ while traveling through England and Scotland. Having made a reputation by\
        \ his pen he became the editor of a Belfast newspaper, subsequently engaging\
        \ in gen- journalism. His real work, however, was yet to be done. The Hitherto\
        \ unsuspected poetical talent soon made itself manifest, and the fount being\
        \ once opened, the flow from it was incessant. Poem after poem almost flashed\
        \ from His pen. He needed but to fix his mind a moment on the theme and the\
        \ impetuous thought rushed at once into form in lines of pure melody and surpassing\
        \ vigor. A better illustration of the adage that poets are born, not made,\
        \ Has never been known than appeared in the almost instantaneous ascent of\
        \ Davis to a place of honor on the Mount of the Muses. His whole soul was\
        \ in his work, and the patriotic fervor of his nature burned in the lines\
        \ he wrote. His premature death was a sad loss to his country and its litera\
        \ ture. Had be been spared to continue the labor for which He was so nobly\
        \ qualified, even a more brilliant name than the one He bequeathed would have\
        \ been placed on the roll of Ireland's poets. Writing of him in His work entitled\
        \ \" Y'oung Ireland,\" Charles Gavan Duffy, probably the most intimate of\
        \ his friends, says: \u2014 \"Judging of him now, a generation after his death,\
        \ when years and communion with the world have tempered the exaggerations\
        \ of youthful friendship, I can confidently say that I Have not known a man\

        \ a sturdy personal independence characteristic of the writer. \" Caste and\
        \ Creed,\" for instance, might have been written by Burns. Mr. Davis was elected\
        \ successively to the posi tions of Librarian in the People's Institute, Belfast,\
        \ and Assistant Registrar in the Queen's College in the same place. He died\
        \ in September, 1885. Davis, Thomas ( \xBBsborne. The Beranger of Ireland,\

  - - ['RUINS OF YARMOUTH TOLHOUSE By the destruction of the Tolhouse, which was gutted
        by fire in a recent raid. Yarmouth has lost a building which has been very
        closely associated. with the history of the town through out the centuries.
        Since 1905 it has been used as a museum, and it is one of the minor tragedies
        of the raid that the vast majority of the exhibits were destroyed. Many of
        them were intimately associated with Yarmouth and can never be replaced- Mr.
        R. G. Watlow, the Curator, told a reporter that the collections of early English
        drinking glasses. Yarmouth glass and Lowestoft ware, which were in the dungeons,
        were saved, but that little else has been recovered from the wreckage. Though
        the adjoining public library suffered comparatively little damage and is again
        open for the issue of books, it is a great blow to Mr. Watlow. and indeed
        to all lovers of old Yarmouth, that the reference library was destroyed. Here
        hundreds of volumes relating to the history of Yarmouth went up in flames.
        Not a great deal is known of the early history of the Tolhouse. In 1362 it
        was owned by Stephen de Stalham, and how it became vested in the Corporation
        is unknown. A hundred years earlier the dungeons were used to house prisoners,
        and for 600 years they were used for this purpose, the last prisoner being
        dis charged in 1879. At the time of the Long Parliament Royalists were con-
        fined there, and it was here that. Sarah Martin became the first prison visitor
        and gained the name of the Prisoners'' Friend. In the hall above, the Borough
        Court was formerly held. Before 1622 all meetings of the Council were held
        at the old Guildhall, but in that year "the great chamber of the Tol house
        was ordered to be fitted and provided for assemblies." In its very earliest
        days the building was used for collecting tolls, a right conferred on the
        borough by King : John when he gave the town its first charter. Apparently
        it was then owned privately and lent to the town. Whether the Tolhouse will
        be restored when happier days arrive can- '', not now''De stated with any
        certainty. but ae it wa. scheduled under the 1913 Act of Ancient Monuments
        of Great Britain there is good ground for hoping that it will one day again
        becomT> a museum and show place worthy of Yarmouth''s long history. The Yarmouth
        librarian reported to a recent meeting of the Public Libraries and Museum
        Committee on* the approximate extent of the damage and stated that if it was
        found practicable to carry out certain repairs to the library premises the
        facilities of the lending library and reading room 1 could be continued without
        procuring f alternative accommodation, though I other premises were available
        if . necessary. The work of the library , could be continued with a reduced
        I staff. A sub-committee was appointed to consider the whole question.', 1]

        \ together the beds from this section and from that. Here, for example, we\
        \ may find the bare granite showing itself on the surface, with not one bed\
        \ above it. If there were ever any laid down they have long since disap peared\
        \ under the action of denudation. At another place, what is known to have\

        \ on them without any intermediate ones, are what we are well aware must be\
        \ regarded from the geologist's point of view as almost modern beds. Thus,\
        \ by watching their opportunities all over the world, students of the branch\
        \ of science with which we are at present concerned, have been enabled to\
        \ put together their common stock of knowledge so effectively that it may\
        \ be taken for granted that, though facts innumerable are still to be discovered,\
        \ and modifications with out end to be made, no extensive series of unexplored\
        \ strata, or any new geological period, remain to be added to those which\
        \ the investigators of the present century have brought to light. inversion\
        \ which we have already studied (Vol. I., p. 75), that the upper one is more\
        \ recent than the under one. Again, it is perfectly certain when a section\
        \ shows non-conform ability (Vol. I., p. 77) that a vast interval of time\
        \ must have elapsed between the time of the deposition of the lower and the\
        \ upper strata, notwithstanding the fact of their con tiguity. These data\
        \ have already been more or less fully alluded to, when we had occa sion to\
        \ describe the various appearances which the strata present. But the great\
        \ fact ascertained by modem research is that though any particular bed may\
        \ be wanting in any particular section, the remaining ones always preserve\
        \ their order of superposition. For instance, to anticipate a little, a cutting\
        \ may show Chalk, Carboniferous beds, and Old Red Sandstone (or Devo nian),\
        \ proving that a great many intervening strata were missing. But though a\
        \ few miles away the next section might show London Clay, Chalk, Permian,\
        \ Old Red Sandstone, and Silurian, it is perfectly certain that the beds would\
        \ never occupy any other than their regular position. If we find Silurian\
        \ or Old Red Sandstone, it is needless going down in the hope of finding Carboniferous\
        \ beds, or when we reach Permian of fancying that the Cretaceous strata may\
        \ be reached by boring a little deeper. Or to put the matter in a simpler\
        \ way, Ave may pile one upon another the volumes of an encyclop\xE6dia, the\
        \ first lowest, and the others in regular sequence as issued, until the twenty-fourth\
        \ volume lies on the top. We might withdraw one here and there, until the\
        \ series was imperfect, but still the sequence would be preserved, even though\
        \ it ran two, five, six, seven, ten, twelve, thirteen, seventeen, nineteen,\
        \ twenty, and twenty-one, the twenty second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth\
        \ having been \" denuded \" by the librarian or borrowed without being returned.\
        \ These facts are of the first importance, for they lie at the bottom of all\
        \ attempts to classify rocks according to their age. A well-instructed observer\
        \ can tell much of the history of a rock from looking at a cutting of it.\
        \ If composed of sand he is en titled to draw certain conclusions as to the\
        \ agent by which the particles composing it were worn from the parent rock\
        \ ; if of mud he is equally justified in making tolerably positive inferences\
        \ as to the character of the river or sea in which it was laid down. The mineralogical\

        \ its head-quarters in Auckland. It is the principal financial house in the\
        \ colony, and keeps the Government account. The Dunedin establishment is only\
        \ a branch office, but this does not prevent it from being the handsomest\
        \ building in the town, admirably suited to its purpose, and constructed Avith\
        \ excellent taste in every detail. A remarkable structure is the head office\
        \ of the Union Steamship Company\u2014 the company which enjoys the monopoly\
        \ of the inter-colonial and coast traffic. The architect has succeeded in\
        \ giving the building a maritime air, by means of a number of little turrets\
        \ surmounted by Aveathercocks. There are many more fine commercial buildings\
        \ : insurance offices on a much larger scale than a prudent share holder can\
        \ approve ; Avarehouses than Avhich there are none larger in Melbourne and\
        \ Sydney. But buildings of this type are all very much like each other, and\
        \ a de scription of the petty differences Avhich distinguish them could only\
        \ Aveary the reader. SomeAvhat out of the ordinary, however, is the interior\
        \ of Messrs. SievAvright, Stout, and Co.'s office. These gentlemen are laAvyers,\
        \ but they have cast aside the old- Avorld traditions as to legal offices,\
        \ and built theirs after the model of a bank, there being a large central\
        \ hall, into Avhich the light is let through a stained glass roof, Avith a\
        \ large counter at the end of the ground floor, and offices round. But Ave\
        \ ought to see the public buildings first. Walking up Princes Street, Ave\
        \ come to the Octagon, an eight-sided \" square,\" Avhich might be made very\
        \ pretty if it were entrusted to the care of a good gardener. On the upper\
        \ side of the Octagon is the Toavii Hall, or rather its facade, for the hall\
        \ itself is not likely to be built for many a y7ear to come. Nevertheless,\
        \ the front is \\*ery imposing, and the chances are that you do not notice\
        \ the posterior deficiencies of the building unless some apolo getic cicerone\
        \ calls attention to them. This Toavii Hall is no bad emblem of the history\
        \ of the province, -with its \"grand\" ideas and love of putting its best\
        \ foot foremost. In the sixties and seventies everyone thought that Dunedin\
        \ Avas going to be a little London, but the eighties have changed all that,\
        \ and many are the citizens who have begun their private toAvn-halls in the\
        \ sanguine belief of indefinite progress, and Avere stopped short in the building-\
        \ by subsequent \" bad times.\" On the loAver side of the Octagon is the Athen\xE6\
        um, of Avhich no Dunedin citizen cares to haA*e more notice taken than he\
        \ can help. It is the only approach to a public library that this fine toAA*n\
        \ can boast, but it is an approach carefully guarded from those who most need\
        \ it by a guinea subscription, Avhilst both the quality and the condition\
        \ of the books leave something to be desired There is, however, a reading-room\
        \ with newspapers and magazines, to Avhich visitors to the tOAvn can have\
        \ free access by giving their names to the librarian. At the University there\
        \ is a library containing some o-ood books, but it has been starved ever since\
        \ the depression set in. In the Supreme Court, again, there is a legal library,\
        \ to Avhich one can get access Avithout much difficulty. But it remains the\
        \ darkest blot upon the fair fame of Dunedin that it has no public library.\
        \ Although laid out on level ground, the public gardens are pretty, but un\
        \ fortunately they are situated at the northern extremity of the tOAvn, practically",

        \ of the city, and was the Master Lawson of Pitscottie, who witnessed the\
        \ portentous affair at the Cross of Edinburgh previous to the battle of Flodden-field.\
        \ It is worthy of remark that many of the names given show that the occupants\
        \ of these booths were men of note, forming the leading burgesses of the city\
        \ at that time. That these rentals of booths in the Tolbuith and Belhouse\
        \ refer to tlie buildings erected on the piece of ground granted by Robert\
        \ II. in 1386 admits of very little doubt. Maitland, in his History of Edin\
        \ burgh, refers to this charter; but he supposes that the ground was higher\
        \ up the street \u2014 about Milne's Court. In the charter of James III. in\
        \ 1470, regulating and fixing the stances of the different market places in\
        \ the city, there is the following reference to the Belhous: \u2014 \" Also\
        \ the Cramys of Chepman to be set from the Belhous down to the Tron, on the\
        \ north side of the said street.\" The site of the meal market of grains and\
        \ corns was fixed by the same instrument \"frae the Tol buith up to Liberton's\
        \ Wynd,\" clearly showing that the Belhous was not above that point. Wilson,\
        \ in his Memorials, describes the Tolbuith as a tall and gloomy-looking pile\
        \ of buildings ; and he has given two views, showing the north and south fronts,\
        \ the two being very dissimilar to each other. Those prints show very distinctly\
        \ that the pile consisted of two separate structures. The larger and western\
        \ portion was built of plain rubble on both the north and south sides; while\
        \ the smaller and eastern portion next the church was of polished ashlar;\
        \ and on the north side it was rather handsome, whereas the south front was\
        \ of the same character as the south front of the west portion, and had a\
        \ round pro jecting tower at the south-east end. There is no print in existence\
        \ (so far as I am aware) of the Luckenbooths. The one now given (see Plate\
        \ VI.) is a facsimile of a pen-and-ink drawing by the late Rev. John Sime,\
        \ contained in a volume of prints and original drawings in the Society's Library,\
        \ which the librarian has kindly allowed me to copy. It shows the entire length\
        \ of the north front of the Lucken booths, along with the Belhous and Tolbooth.\
        \ The south front of these two structures (Plate VIL) is also from a pen-and-ink\
        \ drawing in the same volume. The cut representing the east end of Creech's\
        \ Land, looking down the High Street (fig. 1, p. 374), is from Creech's",

    - ['THE HISTORY OF CANADA. [''759 290 shed would not prevent the remaining part
        from becoming sacrificed to the fury of their enemies. Their only resource
        was to make their yoke as light as possible. They gave three reasons for this
        view : there was only food in the city to furnish half rations for eight days
        ; there were no means of obtaining any further supply; and there were no troops
        to defend the town. Under the circumstances they were placed, no course was
        open to them but an honourable capitulation. The memoir concluded with " Finally
        preserve the little which has escaped fire. It is not disgraceful to yield
        when it is impossible to conquer. The citizens, sir, flatter themselves that
        they have proved what they say, and they hope, from your ''humanity, that
        you will not expose them to the hardships of an assault and of famine." De
        Ramezay did what any one would have done in his place. He called a council
        of war, producing the orders of de Vaudreuil to capitulate when there was
        no food. It met on the 15th ; it consisted of fourteen officers.* With the
        excep tion of an officer named de Fiedmont, the vote was unanimous for an
        honourable capitulation. Had de Ramezay immediately acted on this decision,
        he would have been spared much of the calumny which has been unjustly thrown
        on his name. That he did not do so, he has written with some bitterness, was
        the only cause why he could reproach himself. While these events were taking
        place, de Ramezay received a message from de Vaudreuil to the effect that
        he was about immediately sending food, which was to come by water ; but time
        passed, and none arrived. On the morning of the 17th de Ramezay sent to Beauport
        to gather what had been left, but the camp had already been pillaged by the
        habitants. The flour stores had been plundered and everything thrown about
        in disorder. It is strange to relate that in these four * The only name familiar
        at this date in Canadian life is that of de Celles; the present representative
        of the family is the general librarian of the house of com mons at Ottawa.
        I will take this opportunity of thankfully acknowledging the many obligations
        under which Mr. de Celles has placed me during my labours on this work.',

        parliament, permits me to use his name as an authority that the song of "
        Malbrough s''en va-t-en guerre " still holds its place among the songs of
        the habitants in the country parishes. There can be no doubt that it was brought
        to Canada by the French soldiers. The tradition is, that it was originally
        written by the nurses of the children of the duke of Bourgogne, the pupil
        of Fenelon ; and, no doubt, verses have been added from time to time. It possibly
        was written after the battle of Oudenarde. Blenheim was fought on the 13th
        of August, 1704, for Marlborough''s name to become a household word in France
        ; Oudenarde on the nth of July, 1708. The duke de Bourgogne had supreme command,
        but he was accompanied by Vendome, in reality to be the guiding spirit of
        the campaign. The duke preferred to take the counsel of M. de Puysegur, in
        modern history a mere name. The battle, as was usual in those days, was won
        by Marlborough and Eugene. Venddme, alone in the council of war, was desirous
        of continuing the fight on the following day ; moreover, he considered that
        the action had been lost from neglect of his counsel. The death of the young
        duke made a profound sensation in Europe. He had married Marie Adelaide of
        Savoy, remembered as throwing such a charm over the last years of Louis XIV.
        She died from fever on the 12th of February, 1 7 12, in her twenty sixth year
        ; the dauphin, her husband, for such was his rank, owing to the death of his
        father, the only legitimate son of Louis, who had died on the previous nth
        of April, died in his thirtieth year, six days aster her death. It was for
        their children the song was written. The eldest, also called the duke of Bourgogne,
        then five years old, died on the 8th of May, 1712. The second, the duke of
        Anjou, afterwards Louis XV., was then but two years old. I am impelled to
        give the song entire, as now sung in Canada. Malbrough s''en va-t-en guerre,

        must be a hindrance to general progress. Poetry and all light literature may
        spring from individual inspiration ; but positive knowledge relies on exten-

        all ages proved to be equal to. There have been giants in that country in

        than I need mention), phenomena of men whose heads carried all the knowledge
        at which the world had then arrived ; and traces of the same powers have constantly
        shown themselves even throughout the period of Italy''s most calamitous times.

        \ you must have to his proposal, but which you cannot write. Only think of\

        trouble Avould be created by establishing them near the frontier, as the constant
        antagonism would lead to perpetual quarrels. He, therefore, proposed that
        the part of the province of Quebec adjoining the frontier should be left for
        settlement by French Canadians, while the loyalists from the old provinces
        could be established on the Saint Lawrence running back to the Ottawa and
        to the east at the bay of Chaleurs. In order more readily to control this
        view, in February, 1783, he revived the office of solicitor-general, appointing
        Mr. Jenkyn Williams to it, and at the same time making him inspector of the
        king''s domain, so that he could carry on his own theories of settlement.
        Several years had to pass before the prejudices which were felt regarding
        the climate of Canada were to pass away and they long retarded emigration.
        We cannot say that even in modern times they have entirely ceased to be. In
        1784 a pamphlet published in London described Nova Scotia " as a country where
        there were nine months of winter and three months of cold weather. . . A winter
        of almost insuperable length and coldness. . . There are but a few inconsiderable
        spots fit to cultivate. . . The land is covered with a cold spongy moss in
        place of grass. . . The land is so barren that corn does not come in it .
        . the country wrapt in the gloom of perpetual fog. . . The mountains run down
        to the sea and leave but here and there a spot fit to inhabit."* And these
        opinions were by no means uncommon. In 1784 Powell carried to England the
        petition praying for the repeal of the Quebec act ; the establishment of a
        house of assembly ; full exercise of the Habeas Corpus ; the decision of trials
        by juries chosen by option, entirely English or French-speaking, with security
        for the indepen dence of the judges ; and sundry other points of minor * As
        quoted by Mr. Sabine in his American Loyalists, p. 65 : Mr. de Celles, the
        general librarian of parliament, informs me that he has seen a MS. letter
        from lord de Spencer, in which, he declined to purchase the seigniory de Lauzon,
        on the ground that it was too near the north pole.', 1]

        church of the Recollets, which with great liberality had been granted to the
        protestants at the hours when the fathers were not them selves engaged in
        their own services. The congregation of this city urged upon the bishop to
        obtain permission for the use of the Jesuits'' church, which, owing to the
        suppression of the order, was in disuse and bad repair. Lord Dorchester acceded
        to this request, and further agreed to place the building itself in good condition,
        leaving to the congregation the expense of fitting up the pews and furnishing
        the interior. He enforced the duty of retaining a pew for the governor, and
        proposed that the church should be called Christchurch: the first systematic
        establishment of the church of England in Montreal. Bishop Inglis subsequently
        held a visitation at Quebec. There were then eight clergymen in the whole
        of Canada, exclusive of three army chaplains. The first episcopal conference
        of the protestant church was held in the Recollets'' church, Quebec, on the
        5th of August. Mr. Toosey, the rector of Quebec, preached the sermon. He was
        followed by Mr. Stuart, of Kingston, and Mr. Daly, of Sorel. On that occasion
        the bishop held a confirmation, the first time the rite had been performed
        in Canada. Bishop Inglis laid down admirable rules for the guidance of the
        church, which can still be followed with advantage. He preached his farewell
        sermon in August, and on the following day sailed for Halifax. There is one
        point to which I am impelled to allude, seeling that some explanation is necessary,
        owing to the want of knowledge on the subject and the consequent misapprehension
        which has arisen. I allude to the term, " my lord," given to bishops of the
        Anglican church, even when elected by the synod. I avail myself of the explanation
        furnished by the late Dr. Alpheus Todd, the former librarian of parliament,
        whose contributions to the history of parliamentary government * have gained
        for him a permanent place in the literature of the empire, and whose personal
        amiability and courtesy still continue as a tradition with the old frequenters
        of the library. He thus explains the matter in a few words : " It was during

        he first sought to gather an audience, and on the whole the help had been
        effectual. Yet Bower had not borne the test of nearer acquaintance; Egremont
        soon knew the vulgarity of his nature, and had much difficulty in sustaining
        the show of friendly intercourse with him. One evening in mid-February, he
        called the portly man to speak with him after lecture, and, with what geniality
        he could, explained to him the details of his library project and told whom
        he had chosen for librarian. Bower professed himself highly satisfied with

        institution formerly known as the Permanent Library and News Room, was established
        in 1835, in conjunction with the Town Museum, for the reception of antiquities
        and geological and other objects of interest. The leading papers and periodicals
        were taken in, and the Library, which eventually exceeded 3,000 volumes, including
        many standard and valuable works, was supplemented by the presentation from
        the Government of a complete series of the Calendars of the Public Records.
        In 1863, it was resolved at a public meeting, to remove the Permanent Library
        from Mr. Baily''s, where it had been for some years located, to the Corn Hall
        Buildings, and to unite it with the Mechanics'' Institute. This institution
        had existed for about twenty years, and, although for the closing two or three
        years of its career it had been less prosperous, had received in its time
        a large measure of public support, the reading room being supplied with the
        leading daily papers, the library containing some 500 volumes, whilst numerous
        excellent lectures on social, historical, and scientific subjects had been
        delivered under its auspices. By the union of the two, the existing institution
        was then formed, the subscription being fixed at 21s., 10s. 6d., and 5s. per
        annum, according to the privileges of membership. For several years the news
        room was largely patronized, and the constant services of a librarian retained,
        but of late years the subscriptions have fallen off, and it was consequently
        found necessary, first to dispense with the librarian, and recently to sell
        the whole of the Library by auction, and to exchange rooms with Messrs. Moore
        and Hill. The cause of the news room being less patronized is perhaps owing
        to the increased purchase of papers and periodicals by the public in general,
        and the exclusion of chess and draughts, which were permitted at the Mechanics''
        Institute. The Roman antiqui ties in the Town Museum were removed in 1856
        to the Museum specially built for their reception ; and the other articles,
        comprising several excellent geological and ornithological specimens, and
        including some fossilized remains of the Icthyosaurus, Plesio saurus, and
        other extinct animals, principally found in the construction of the Great
        Western Railway, near Minety, a splendid case of fossils from Palermo, presented
        by the late Marquis of Northampton, with specimens of coral, stuffed birds,

        \ in the past and at the present time, have been and are an honour to the\

        \ respect in which he was held, as a consequence of his thorough integrity,\

        \ the office of High Sheriff ofthe county of Lancaster. Says Fuller, \" Every\

        not received with too much favour. Much controversy and many suggestions ensued,
        and a town''s* meeting was held in February to consider the matter, with the
        result that a resolution was passed approving of the scheme. This was not
        sufficient for the Council. Books were all very well in their way ; but why
        such a valuable building and site should be appropriated for such a purpose
        was not quite apparent. The matter became urgent ; and towards the end of
        March the books were removed from Campfield and stowed away in the back rooms
        of the Old Town Hall, until the Council had made up its mind what to do with
        them. Near the end of April a somewhat grudging assent was given to their
        temporary location in the Old Town Hall, the Libraries Committee being at
        the same time instructed to inquire after a suitable site hi the centre of
        the city for their permanent lodgment. This was quite enough. The library
        onee housed therein, the appro priateness of its location was soon acknowledged
        on all hands ; and now, after ten years'' experience of its working, the only
        thing we have to consider is how best the accommodation afforded can be enlarged
        and extended. The visitor, passing up the steps from King Street and under
        the fine portico, enters a sufficiently spacious hall, from which a staircase

        Chief Librarian and Sub-librarian, Messrs. Sutton and Credland, are always
        at hand, anxious to afford any information which may be desired. The Library
        itself is a very excellent one, and well selected, although we cannot aspire
        to any such completeness and perfection as are found in the British Museum.
        That the convenience of students and readers generally is largely consulted,
        may be inferred from the long hours during which it is open to all, viz.,

        \ On reaching the Place Kleber, one of the largest and finest open spaces\
        \ in Strasburg, the signs of destruction were most striking. The hand some\
        \ building which filled the north-eastern side of the square, and in which\
        \ was a valuable museum of ancient and modern works of art, is now repre sented\
        \ by empty walls. Nearly every house has been pierced with shot or shell.\
        \ The hotel in which I write this, the well-known Maison Rouge, has been struck\
        \ more than once. Being one of the first civilians who anived here, I succeeded\
        \ in getting one of the few rooms which the German officers had not taken\
        \ possession of. Wishing to breakfast, I called for the bill of fare. It was\
        \ as long and elaborate as usual. I came to the con clusion that, although\
        \ the city had been severely injured by the bombardment, the inhabitants had\
        \ been able to procure not only the necessaries, but also the luxuries, of\
        \ life. But I was soon unde ceived. The bill of fare was a relic of pre-siege\
        \ days. I could get beef or' ham or pate de foie gras. Towards the end of\
        \ the siege, when provisions became very scarce, pate de foie gras was one\
        \ of the most common articles of food. Large stores of it, intended for exportation,\
        \ had accumulated. Coffee and wine could be had in abundance, but milk was\
        \ unprocurable, and butter could not be purchased under five francs the pound.\
        \ I had not been many hours in Strasburg before a change took place in all\
        \ these respects. Carts laden with vegetables entered the city. Butter was\
        \ again placed on the table. It was announced that milk would be obtain able\
        \ on the morrow.\" The writer lost no time in visit ing all the points of\
        \ interest, and of the cathedral he reported that the spire had been injured\
        \ in more places than one. The cross on its summit leaned on one side, as\
        \ if it had been struck by a projectile. Some of the ornamental work had been\
        \ carried away, and in one of the side towers a portion of the stone stairs\
        \ had been destroyed. The outer roof of the nave was burned, and the windows\
        \ here and there were broken with balls. \" To this place the German soldiers\
        \ hastened as soon as they got here. They ascended the tower, they explored\
        \ the interior. The officers were as eager as the men not only to see the\
        \ renowned cathe dral, but also to learn the truth as to the damage done to\
        \ it. All with whom I conversed expressed their satisfaction at the comparative\
        \ unimportance of the injury inflicted. They would have lamented the destruction\
        \ of the cathedral quite as sincerely as the Strasburgers themselves. It is\
        \ the belief of the latter that the destruction of the cathedral was one of\
        \ the designs of the besiegers. More than one German artillery officer assured\
        \ me that orders were daily given not only to spare the city, but also carefully\
        \ to avoid firing in such a way as would either damage or endanger the cathedral.\
        \ Other public buildings, however, have not escaped. The Prefecture, the theatre,\
        \ and the church \u2014 whereof the world-renowned Library formed a part \u2014\
        \ are now represented by bare walls.\" The destruction of the Library was\
        \ more par ticularly described by a correspondent of the Times, who said :\
        \ \u2014 \" In the choir of the Temple Neuf, divided from the nave, was lodged\
        \ the espe cial glory of Alsace \u2014 its Library, the finest on the Rhine,\
        \ in which the archives, antiquities, topo graphy, and early printing collections\
        \ were trea sured. All have perished. Since the apocryphal burning of the\
        \ library of Alexandria, perhaps no equally irreparable loss has occurred.\
        \ The walls are standing ; all else is a mass of ruins. In the entrance vestibule\
        \ was a collection of Gallo-Roman antiquities, altars, inscriptions, bas-reliefs,\
        \ statuary ; a few of these may be restored. A stone let into the wall, in\
        \ which was cut a head of Louis XIV., and a notice that it had been taken\
        \ from the cachots of the Bastille, had a portion destroyed. In the interior\
        \ of the choir nothing was visible but heaps of ruin and charred paper. I\
        \ picked up some fragments on which the old Aldine and early German types\
        \ were still legible. In the nave of the church the vaulted roofing had fallen\
        \ to the ground in a huge mountain of ruins. Everything had perished save\
        \ the old monuments let into the walls, that of Tauler, the mystic preacher,\
        \ being the most interesting. The utter destruction of this Library seemed\
        \ to me so incredible that I have yesterday and to-day repeatedly put the\
        \ question, Was nothi?ig saved ? Not a single leaf ! There was a fatality\
        \ about the Library. No catalogue of its many treasures exists. An elaborate\
        \ one in MS. had been prepared by the librarian. It has perished ! M. Silbermann,\
        \ publisher of the Cour rier du Bas-Rhin, tells me that a whole library of\
        \ MSS. of his grand work, the ' Alsace Antiquary,' has perished, among them\
        \ sixteen folio vols. of MSS. upon Strasburg. The greatest loss of all is\

        \ of the suppression of this very noble Monastery \u2122>'\xABMi of St. Mary\
        \ of Dublin, it was a very sad spectacle to God and men. Then, little by little,\
        \ the other Monasteries saw themselves desolate and ruined. For, in accordance\
        \ with the statutes of Parliament under Henry VIII., King of England, and\
        \ owing to the ambition and avarice of the laity, which they had imbibed together\
        \ with the pestilential heresy, they panted for the Monastery and its very\
        \ rich possessions. Though they attempted three times, each time by the King's\
        \ authority, to wrest the Monastery, with its appurtenances, from the Monks,\
        \ yet these resisted vigorously, defending th > rights graciously granted\
        \ and confirmed to them by many Supreme Pontiffs and by the Kings of Ireland\
        \ and England. But the power of the King and of these greedy men prevailed,\
        \ and the Abbot and Monks were put in chains, cast into prison by an armed\
        \ crowd, in hunger, thirst, and nakedness. Then they were taken to the village\
        \ of Ballyboght, belonging to the said Monastery, and slain. ' At that time,'\
        \ says Philip O'Sullevan, ' the religious of the Monastery of Dublin were\
        \ slain and rooted out by different kinds of death. It was supposed that they\
        \ were no less than fifty in the year 1541.' \" Listen to the account of the\

        \ of Paris to them- selves. The middle-classes were for the most part monarchical,\
        \ though, until cheered by the triumph of their views in the provinces, they\
        \ had not the courage to say so. By the middle of February they began to declare\
        \ themselves \u2014 some with timidity and caution, others more boldly. The\
        \ Paris correspondent of the Times asked a librarian who had expressed strong\
        \ monarchical opinions, and had openly condemned the Republic, how he could\
        \ venture to do so in Paris. His answer was that he had fought side by side\
        \ with the battalions of the National Guard from the Belleville quarter, and\
        \ had seen how ready they were to run away. \" They are arrant cowards,\"\
        \ he said, \" whom we know we can beat if it comes to fighting : they are\
        \ no longer the men of '92.\" The same corre- spondent heard a discussion\
        \ in a political club to much the same effect. At this meeting, \"a speaker,\
        \ dwelling upon the political cowardice which made his countrymen go like\
        \ sheep in a direction they secretly detested, urged upon them the necessity\
        \ of greater courage in expressing their sentiments in their choice of a form\
        \ of Government. ' Are you a -Monarchist or a Republican ?' shouted a man\
        \ in the audience. This was rather too sudden an application of his own preaching\
        \ to suit the speaker, who seemed embarrassed for a moment, and then said,\
        \ amid loud laughter, ' On this point I must be permitted to follow the example\
        \ of my audience, and remain silent.' It was evident that he was a Monarchist,\
        \ and afraid as yet to say so ; but, finding the meeting by no means hostile\
        \ to reactionary views, he took advantage of their ap- parent sympathy, and\
        \ went so far in denouncing the Republic that another man took courage, and\
        \ with some boldness denounced it as unfit for the country in its present\
        \ condition, illustrating his position by the character of the local elections,\
        \ and by the fact that political exile was a far stronger qualification in\
        \ the eyes of the Republican than any talent. He alluded with gratification\
        \ to the election of the Duke d'Aumale and Prince de Joinville, and denied\
        \ that Paris could be considered in any way to represent even the large towns\
        \ of France.\" The existence of this feeling was doubt- less much more general\
        \ than might have been sup- posed. The Republic is always established in Paris\
        \ by a surprise ; and the return of so many extreme politicians in the recent\
        \ elections was rather to be attributed to the defective organisation of the\
        \ moderate party, and to civic cowardice, than to the existence of an actual\
        \ majority in favour of the Red Republic. much of its wonted aspect. The first\
        \ appearance of sullen gloom and smouldering anger dis- appeared with the\
        \ arrival of food from the pro vinces and abroad, and in a little while something\
        \ of the old gaiety, self-esteem, and confidence re- turned. People said that\
        \ after all Paris had not been conquered by the Prussians; it had only been\
        \ vanquished by hunger : a statement not without a certain degree of truth,\
        \ though subject to the im portant qualification that it was the Prussians\
        \ who produced the hunger. France was going to pre pare herself for a renewal\
        \ of the sight at no distant day, and in a few years' time her soldiers would\
        \ be in Berlin. For the present, there was life to be enjoyed, and the future\
        \ must take care of itself. It is true that a large proportion of the Parisian\
        \ populace was in mourning, and that hardly a woman was to be seen who did\
        \ not wear black. But the theatres were again open and well-attended ; and\
        \ the old animation returned to the streets; and Paris once more danced and\
        \ gesticulated as of yore, and tried to believe herself the queen and oracle\
        \ of the world. The men were never tired of admiring their own heroism, and\
        \ the women swore they would educate their children in the religion of undying\
        \ hatred of Prussia, to take effect as soon as the Republic had regenerated\
        \ the nation, and trained society to a practical faith in the brother- hood\
        \ of peoples. It was under this condition of things as regards the metropolis\
        \ that M. Thiers entered on the task of government at Bordeaux. On Sunday,\
        \ the 19th of February, the newly-appointed head of the Executive read a speech\
        \ in the Assembly, stating that, although he felt frightened at the painful\
        \ duty imposed on him, he nevertheless accepted it with obedience, devotion,\
        \ and love \u2014 sentiments of which France stood all the more in need as\
        \ she was now more unfortunate than at any other period of her history. The\
        \ country, however, was still great, young, rich, and full of resources, and\
        \ would always remain a lasting monument of human energy. M. Thiers then announced\
        \ that he had formed his Administration, and that, in selecting its members,\
        \ he had been guided solely by the public esteem they enjoyed, and their character\
        \ and capacities. The list was as follows : M. Dufaure Minister of Justice.\

        Salaberry as one who had command of the advanced pickets, conveying the idea
        that he himself was directing the operations, whereas he was not in the field
        during the action, and de Salaberry was in supreme command. Lieutenant-colonel
        M''Donnell he never mentions, and in no way alludes to the march made by his
        own orders from Kingston, and the rapidity with which it had been effected,
        so that the regiment arrived on the ground a few hours only before the action.
        In his thanks he places first on the list general de Watteville for the measures
        taken by him, when he was five miles distant from the ground at the time of
        the action, and did not arrive until after Prevost himself, and was only present
        owing to a note written to him by lieutenant-colonel M''Donnell during the
        engagement. Prevost acknowledges the services of de Salaberry as of an ordinary
        character, in the tone generally taken when speaking of a higher subordinate,
        who had attentively carried out his orders. He specifies several officers,
        but not the regiment of the flank companies com manded by M''Donnell. He indeed
        ignores them, and describes the number "actually engaged" as 300, and speaks
        in a general way of the militia present. Hampton''s force he described as
        consisting of 7,000 infantry, 200 cavalry, and 10 guns. In his report Prevost
        gave the engagement the character of an outpost affair. Indeed his despatch
        was a tissue of misrepresentations. The loss of de Salaberry''s force was
        five rank and file killed; two captains, one sergeant, thirteen rank and file
        wounded. * * Among the authorities to which I have referred are some MS. notes

        \ the influence of lord Camden, that in 1804 in succession to brigadier Beckwith,\
        \ he was selected by Pitt for the government of Bermuda. In the note of the\
        \ acceptance of the appointment George III. made a kindly allusion to the\
        \ services of his father. In 1806 Gore, having been appointed lieutenant-governor\
        \ of Upper Canada, came direct from Bermuda, receiving an allowance of \xA3\
        100 for travelling expenses.* Gore's government was subjected to much embarrassment,\
        \ caused by a clique of men who, working in common for their own advantage,\
        \ assumed the character of acting in the public interest. The principal member\
        \ was Mr. justice Thorpe ; the secondary personages were Weekes, a barrister,\
        \ the mem ber for York ; Wyatt, the surveyor-general ; and Willcocks, the\
        \ sheriff of York. Thorpe has been mentioned by many writers as having been\
        \ actuated by public spirit, and as having been sacrificed to the interests\
        \ of the officials known as the \" Family Compact.\" Whenever that so-called\
        \ party took its rise, in 1807 nothing of the kind existed. Its commencement\
        \ may perhaps be dated about 1820, shortly after the nomina tion of bishop\
        \ Strachan as an executive councillor, when> with chief justice Powell, they\
        \ became the leading personages * After his withdrawal from the government\
        \ of Upper Canada, through the influence of lord Camden, Gore was appointed\
        \ in 1818 deputy-teller of the exchequer, a position he held until it ceased\
        \ to exist in lord Grey's administration of 1830. Gore retired on a pension,\
        \ and became an active member of the managing committee of the Athen\xE6um\
        \ club. He was one of the group of men renowned for wit and brilliant conversation,\
        \ prominent among whom was Theo dore Hook. During the last years of his life\
        \ he was a sufferer from acute disease. He lost the use of his lower limbs,\
        \ his disease terminating with dropsy ; he died the 3rd November, 1852, in\
        \ his eighty-fourth year. Gore's parentage and life have hitherto been unknown\
        \ in our history. His personality has been little more than a myth. All that\
        \ has been stated concerning him has been the fact of his governorship. The\
        \ mention made of Gore has been most unjust, both as to the character of his\
        \ government, and his ability and temper. The account I follow is that written\
        \ shortly after his death in Fraser's Magazine, Vol. 47, January to June,\

        of 232* feet. The principal facade consists of a wide central projection and"
        side wings connected by arcades, behind which broad verandas form external
        means of communication between the several galleries, at the same time affording
        shade from the sun and shelter from the rain, as well as additional floor
        space for exhi''oitive purposes. The arches of these arcades (which are continued
        along the sides of the wings), are supported on square piers on the ground
        floor, and spring from light coupled columns with foliated capitals on the
        upper storey, the intervals between the piers and columns being filled in
        with open balustrades. In the middle of the principal front is a commodious
        Carriage Portico, from which seven stono steps ascend to the ground floor
        level. At the head of the steps is a Loggia which is separated from the portico
        by three semicircular arches springing from coupled columns with polished
        shafts and enriched capitals, thus dividing the steps into three distinct
        flights. At either end of the Loggia is an open archway communicating with
        the arcades, and facing the steps are three large entrance doorways which
        give access to the interior of the building. The Central Hall, which is first
        entered, is 29 J feet by 24} feet, and 19 feet high, the latter being the
        height of the lower storey throughout. Beyond the hall, and opposite the principal
        entrance, is the Grand Staircase, which is separated from the hall by a transverse
        open corridor communicating with the arcades on either side. The corridor
        is formed by a set of three semicircular arches, upon panelled square piers
        next the hall, and a parallel set of arches towards the staircase springing
        from round columns, the piers and columns being highly polished and embellished
        with ornamental capitals. The enclosure containing the staircase is carried
        up to the full height of both storeys. and is lighted by three large windows
        in the north wall. The Staircase is constructed of polished teak, with ornamental
        balustrades of metal, and rises, first in a single flight 9 feet broad up
        to a wide intermediate landing, and continues in two return flights, each
        8 feet broad, to the level of the upper floor. At the head of the staircase
        is a wide open corridor similar to that below, communicating with the upper
        arcades right and left, and composed of semicircular arches in two rows springing
        from polished columns enriched with ornamental capitals. Returning to the
        ground floor : to the right of the Central Hall is the Library (29J feet by
        24} feet), which is lighted by six wide and lofty doorways opening into the
        arcades in front and rear. This room is fitted up with handsome bookcases
        of polished teak placed against the end walls, and projecting from the spaces
        between the doorways on the buttress plan ; and in the middle of the room
        is a large table press, including a desk for the Librarian. Be3''ond the Library
        is the Reading and Lecture Room (49 feet by 24} feet), to which light is admitted
        by a recessed window at either end, and five doorways opening into the east
        veranda. Against the west side are placed two ornamental cases for ancient
        MSS., and the remaining wall spaces are hung with framed portraits of literary
        and scientific celebrities. The room is comfortably furnished and fitted up
        with seven starlight gas chandeliers. The front verandas, portico and hall

        \ this active-minded man obtained a thorough knowledge of practical chemistry,\
        \ and in his spare time he acquired an extensive practical and theoretical\

        \ to Mr. Besse, a Quaker in St. George's Court, took orders in the Church\
        \ of England, and married the daughter of a clergyman. Lord Hardwicke patronised\

        \ refuge in the Tower. By royal edict the Christians were forbidden to buy\
        \ flesh of a Jew, and no Jew was allowed to employ Christian nurses, bakers,\
        \ hrewers, or cooks. Towards the close of Henry's life the synagogue in Old\
        \ Jewry was again taken from the Jews, and given to the Friars Penitent, whose\
        \ chapel stood hard by, and who complained of the noise of the Jewish congregation\
        \ ; but the king permitted another synagogue to be built in a more suitable\
        \ place. Henry then ordered the Jews to pay up all arrears of tallages within\
        \ four months, and half of the sum in seventeen days. The Tower of London\
        \ was naturally soon full of grey-bearded Jewish debtors. \" Whole rolls full\
        \ of patents relative to Jewish estates,\" says Mr. Margoliouth, \"are still\
        \ to be seen at the Tower, which estates, together with their rent in fee,\
        \ permissions, and mortgages, were all seized by the king.\" Old Jewry, and\
        \ Jewin Street, Aldersgate, where their burial-ground was, still preserve\
        \ a dim memory of their residence among us. There used to be a tradition in\
        \ England that the Jews buried much of their treasure here, in hopes of a\
        \ speedy return to the land where they had suffered so much, yet where they\
        \ had thriven. In spite of the edict of banishment a few converted Jews continued\
        \ to reside in England, and after the Reformation some unconverted Jews ventured\
        \ to return. Rodrigo Lopez, a physician of Queen Elizabeth's, for instance,\
        \ was a Jew. He was tortured to death for being accused of designing to poison\
        \ the Queen. No wonder, with all these persecutions, that the Chancery Lane\
        \ house of converts began soon to \u25A0fill. \" On one of the rolls of this\
        \ reign,\" says Mr. Margoliouth, probably quoting Prynne's famous diatribe\
        \ against the Jews, \" about 500 names of Jewish converts are registered.\"\
        \ From the 50th year of Henry III. to the 2nd of Edward I., the Crown, says\

        \ ! No. 8, Old Jewry was the house of Sir Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor in the\
        \ time of Charles II. It was a fine brick mansion, and one of the grandest\
        \ houses in the street. It is mentioned by Evelyn in the following terms :\
        \ \u2014 \" 26th September, 1672. \u2014 I carried with me to dinner my Lord\
        \ H. Howard (now to be made Earl of Norwich and Earl Marshal of England) to\
        \ Sir Robert Clayton's, now Sheriff of London, at his own house, where we\
        \ had a great feast; it is built, indeed, for a great magistrate, at excessive\
        \ cost. The cedar dining room is painted with the history of the Giants' war,\
        \ incomparably done by Mr. Streeter, but the figures are too near the eye.\"\
        \ We give on the previous page a view of the garden front of this house, taken\
        \ from an old print. Sir Robert built the house to keep his shrievalty, which\
        \ he did with great magnificence. It was for some years the re sidence of\
        \ Mr. Samuel Sharp, an eminent surveyor. Edward I. was more merciful. In a\
        \ statute, however, which was passed in his third year, he forbade Jews to\
        \ practise usury, required them to wear badges of yellow taffety, as a distinguishing\
        \ mark of their nationality, and demanded from each of them threepence every\
        \ Easter. Then began the plunder. The king wanted money to build Car- narvon\
        \ and Conway castles, to be held as fortresses against the Welsh, whom he\
        \ had just recently con- quered and treated with great cruelty, and the Jews\
        \ were robbed accordingly. It was not difficult in those days to find an excuse\
        \ for extortion if the royal exchequer was empty. In the 7 th year of Edward\
        \ no less than 294 Jews were put to death for clipping money, and all they\
        \ possessed seized by the king. In his 17th year all the Jews in England were\
        \ imprisoned in one night, as Selden proves by an old Hebrew inscription found\
        \ at Winchester, and not released till they had paid ,\xA320,000 of silver\
        \ for a ransom. At last, in the year 1290, . came the Jews' final expulsion\
        \ from England, when 15,000 or 16,000 of these tormented exiles left \u2022\
        our shores, not to return till Cromwell set the first .great example of toleration.\
        \ Edward allowed the Jews to take with them part of then money and In the\

        \ small patrimony, when he ! became first an attendant in Lord Oxford's library\

        \ address, and, when I knew him, rarely sober in the afternoon, never after\
        \ supper. His favourite liquor was porter, with a glass of gin between each\
        \ pot. Dr. Ducarrel told , me he used to stint Oldys to three pots of beer\
        \ whenever he visited him. Oldys seemed to have little classical learning,\
        \ and knew nothing of the sciences ; but for index-reading, title-pages, and\
        \ the knowledge of scarce English books and editions, he had no equal. This\
        \ he had probably picked up in Lord Oxford's service, after whose death he\
        \ was obliged to write for the booksellers sor a subsistence. Amongst many\
        \ other publications, chiefly in the biographical line, he wrote the ' Life\
        \ of Sir Walter Raleigh,' which got him much repu- tation. The Duke of Norfolk,\
        \ in particular, was so pleased with it that he resolved to provide for him,\
        \ and accordingly gave him the patent of 1 Norroy King at Arms, then vacant.\
        \ The patronage of that duke occasioned a suspicion of his being a Papist,\
        \ though I really think without reason ; this for a while retarded his appointment.\
        \ It was underhand propagated by the heralds, who were vexed at having a stranger\
        \ put in upon them. He was a man of great good-nature, honour, and integrity,\
        \ particularly in his character as an his- torian. Nothing, I firmly believe,\
        \ would ever have \\ biassed him to insert any fact in his writings he did\
        \ not believe, or to suppress any he did. Of1 this delicacy he gave an instance\
        \ at a time when he was in great distress. After the publication of his '\
        \ Life of Sir Walter Raleigh,' some booksellers, j thinking his name would\
        \ sell a piece they were ' publishing, offered him a considerable sum to !\
        \ father it, which he refused with the greatest indig- nation. He was much\
        \ addicted-to low company; 1 most of his evenings he spent at the ' Bell '\
        \ in the Old Bailey, a house within the liberties of the Fleet, frequented\
        \ by persons whom he jocularly called rulers, from their being confined to\
        \ the rules or limits of that prison. From this house a watchman, whom he\
        \ kept regularly in pay, used to lead him home before twelve o'clock, in order\
        \ to save sixpence paid to the porter of the Heralds' office, by all those\
        \ ; who came home after that time ; sometimes, and not unfrequently, two were\
        \ necessary. He could not resist the temptation of liquor, even when he was\
        \ to officiate on solemn occasions ; sor at the burial of , the Princess Caroline\
        \ he was so intoxicated that he j could scarcely walk, but reeled about with\
        \ a crown coronet' on a cushion, to the great scandal of his ; b.'ethren.\
        \ His method of composing was somewhat ! singular. He had a number ,of small\
        \ parchment bags inscribed with the names of the persons whose lives he intended\
        \ to write ; into these bags he put every circumstance and anecdote he could\
        \ collect, and from thence drew up his history. By his excesses he was kept\
        \ poor, so that he was frequently in distress ; and at his death, which happened\
        \ about five on Wednesday morning, April 15th, 1 76 r, he left little more\
        \ than was sufficient to bury him. Dr. Taylor, the oculist, son cf the famous\
        \ doctor of that name and profession, claimed administration at the Commons,\
        \ on account of his being nullius filius \u2014 Anglice, a bastard. He was\
        \ buried the T9th following, in the north aisle ofthe Church of St. Benet,\
        \ Paul's Wharf, towards the upper end of the aisle. He was about seventy two\
        \ years old. Amongst his works is a preface to Izaak Walton's 'Angler.'\"\
        \ The Rev. Mark Noble comments upon Grose's text by saying that this story\
        \ of the crown must be incorrect, as the coronet at the funeral of a princess\

        \ Smith, and Barham (the author of \" Ingoldsby Legends \"). Of Sydney Smith's\
        \ connection with St. Paul's we have many interesting records. One of the\
        \ first things Lord Grey said on entering Downing Street, to a relation who\
        \ was with him, was, \" Noiv I shall be able to do something for Sydney Smith,\"\
        \ and shortly after he was appointed by the Premier to a prebendal stall at\
        \ St. Paul's. Mr. Cockerell, the architect, and superintendent of St. Paul's\
        \ Cathedral, in a letter printed in Lady Holland's \"Memoir of Sydney Smith,\"\
        \ describes the gesta ofthe witty canon; how his early communica tions with\

        \ ; but when the canon had investigated the matter, and there had been \"\
        \ a little collision,\" nothing could be more candid and kind than his subsequent\
        \ treatment. He examined the prices of all the materials used in the repairs\
        \ of the cathedral \u2014 as Portland stone, putty, and white lead ; every\
        \ item was taxed, pay ments were examined, and nothing new could be undertaken\
        \ without his survey and personal super intendence. He surveyed the pinnacles\
        \ and heights of the sacred edifice ; and once, when it was feared he might\
        \ stick fast in a narrow opening of the western towers, he declared that \"\
        if there were six inches of space there would be room enough for him.\" The\
        \ insurance of the magni ficent cathedral, Mr. Cockerell tells us, engaged\
        \ his early attention ; and the fabric was speedily and effectually insured\
        \ in some of the most substantial offices in London. Not satisfied with this\
        \ security, he advised the introduction of the mains of the New River into\
        \ the lower parts of the fabric, and cisterns and movable engines in the roof;\
        \ and quite justifiable was his joke that \"he would re produce the Deluge\

        \ a grosser exhi bition than this man's intoxication.\" The library of the\
        \ institution appears, however, to have derived little advantage from Porson's\
        \ supervision of it, beyond the few criticisms which were found in his handwriting\
        \ in some of the volumes. Owing to his very irregular habits, the great scholar\
        \ proved but an inefficient librarian; he was irregular in attendance, and\
        \ was fre quently brought home at midnight drunk. The directors had determined\
        \ to dismiss him, and said they only knew him as their librarian from seeing\
        \ his name attached to receipts of salary. Indeed, he was already breaking\
        \ up, and his stupendous memory had begun to fail. On the 19th of September,\
        \ 1806, he left the Old Jewry to call on his brother-in-law, Perry, in the\
        \ Strand, and at the corner of Northumberland Street was struck down by a\
        \ fit of apoplexy. He was carried over to the St. Martin's Lane workhouse,\
        \ and there slowly recovered consciousness. Mr. Savage, the under-librarian,\
        \ seeing an advertisement in the British Press, describing a person picked\
        \ up, having Greek memoranda in his pocket, went to the workhouse and brought\
        \ Porson home in a hackney coach ; he talked about the fire which the night\
        \ before had destroyed Covent Garden Theatre, and as they rounded St. Paul's,\
        \ remarked upon the ill treatment Wren had received. On reaching the Old Jewry,\
        \ and after he had breakfasted, Dr. Adam Clarke called and had a conversation\
        \ with Porson about a stone with a Greek inscription, brought from Ephesus\
        \ ; he also discussed a Mosaic pavement recently found in Palestrina, and\
        \ quoted two lines from the Greek Anthologia. Dr. Adam Clarke particularly\
        \ noticed that he gave the Greek rapidly, but the English with painful slowness,\
        \ as if the Greek came more naturally. Then, apparently fancying himself under\
        \ restraint, he walked out, and went into the African or Cole's coffee-house\
        \ in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill; there he would have fallen had he not\
        \ caught hold of one of the brass rods of the boxes. Some wine and some jelly\
        \ dissolved in brandy and water considerably roused him, but he could hardly\
        \ speak, and the waiter took him back to the Institution in a coach. He expired\
        \ exactly as the clock struck twelve, on the night of Sunday, September 25,\
        \ 1808. He was buried in the Chapel of Trinity College, Cam bridge, and eulogies\
        \ of his talent, written in Greek and Latin verse, were affixed to his pall\u2014\

        \ Britain ; \" and there is to be found in a few of the books Porson's handwriting,\
        \ jonsisting of critical remarks and notes. In a copy of the Aldine \" Herodotus,\"\
        \ he has marked the chapters in the margin in Arabic numerals \"with such\
        \ nicety and regularity,\" says his bio grapher, \"that the eye of the reader,\
        \ unless upon the closest examination, takes them for print.\" Lord Byron\
        \ remembered Porson at Cambridge ; in the hall where he himself dined, at\
        \ the Vice- Chancellor's table, and Porson at the Dean's, he always appeared\
        \ sober in his demeanour, nor was he guilty, as far as his lordship knew,\
        \ of any excess or outrage in public ; but in an evening, with a party of\
        \ undergraduates, he would, in fits of intoxication, get into violent disputes\
        \ with the young men, and arrogantly revile them for not knowing what he thought\
        \ they might be expected to know. He once went away in disgust, because none\
        \ of them knew the name of \" the Cobbler of Messina.\" In this condition\
        \ Byron had seen him at the rooms of William Bankes, the Nubian dis coverer,\
        \ where he would pour forth whole pages of various languages, and distinguish\
        \ himself especially by his copious floods of Greek. Lord Byron further tells\
        \ us that he had seen Sheridan \" drunk, with all the world ; his intoxi cation\
        \ was that of Bacchus, but Porson's that of Silenus. Of all the disgusting\
        \ brutes, sulky, abusive, and intolerable, Porson was the most bestial, so\

        \ in the same capacity. He was then appointed confidential secretary to the\
        \ electoral prince of Hanover, after wards George I. This private intercourse\
        \ gave him considerable ascendancy over his master ; and being a man of address,\
        \ great knowledge of mankind, and well acquainted with the leading members\
        \ in both Houses of Parliament in England, he was enabled to act a conspicuous\
        \ part. His situation with the King rendered him presumptuous and insolent.\
        \ His necessities were great and his venality notorious, both Townsend and\
        \ Walpole reprobating it. Consequently he became their inveterate enemy, jealously\
        \ promoting the views of Sunderland. He was the most intriguing person of\
        \ all the Hanoverian junto, which also comprised Count Bernsdorff, Baron Bothmar,\
        \ Baron Schutz, and the Hanoverian ladies.\" Dr. O'Connor, of course, states\
        \ his opinion ot M. Robethon as he appeared when his career was more matured\
        \ than it was when he entered the Elector's service. Another authority speaks\
        \ of the Elector's secretary as follows : \u2014 \" He was a man of address,\
        \ great knowledge of mankind, and well acquainted with the leading men of\
        \ Parliament in England.\"* As a consequence of this notoriety and familiarity\

        at one. The table was half covered with a dirty cloth, on which stood a loaf
        of bread (plateless), a small dish ready to receive the fry, and a jug of
        beer. In the midst of the newly painted and papered room, which seemed ready
        to receive furniture of a more elegant kind than that of working-class homes,
        these things had an incongruity. '' And how does the world use you, Mrs. Butterfield,
        ma''am ? '' Bower asked, as he settled his bulky body on the small chair.
        '' I earn my bed and my victuals, Mr. Bower,'' was the reply, as the old woman
        stirred her hissing mess with a fork. '' And a thing to be proud of at your
        age, ma''am.'' From such friendly dialogue, Bower gradually t urned the talk
        to Egremont, of whom he spoke at first as a respected intimate. Observation
        of his collocutor led him shortly to alter his tone a little. When he had
        heard that books were already arriving, he remarked : '' That''s as much as
        to say that you''ll soon be turned out, Mrs. Butterfield. Well, I call it
        hard at your age, ma''am. Now if Egremont had acted like a gentleman and had
        offered me to be librarian, you''d still have kept your place here. I don''t
        want to say disagreeable things, but if ever there was a mean and indecent
        action, it was when he passed over me and gave the place to a stranger. Why,
        Mrs. Butterfield, he has to thank me', 1]

        Son of Peter George Patmore, the author of Literary Reminiscences. In 1847
        he was appointed an assistant librarian at the British Museum, and two years
        later became so far identified with the Pre- Raphaelite movement as to occasionally
        contribute to The Germ. About 1S68 he retired from his post in the British
        Museum and bought an estate of some four hundred acres in Sussex, and subsequently
        removed to Hastings where he still lives, and where he has built a large Catholic
        Church. He has published Tamerton Church Tower, and other Poems, 1S53; The
        Angel in the House, The Betrothal, 1S54; The Espousals, 1S56 ; a revised edi
        tion of the poem appeared in 1S5S, a further revision in 1S60; Faithful for
        Ever, 1860, and The Victories of Love, 1863; Odes, privately printed, 1868
        ; The Unknown Eros, and other Odes, 1877. A collected edition of his poems
        was published in 1S78. He is also the editor of The Children''s Garland in
        the Golden Treasury Series. * Stevenson, Robert Louis Balfour (1850). Born
        at Edinburgh and grandson of Robert Stevenson, the noted engi neer. He was
        educated at the University of Edinburgh, and originally intended for an engineer,
        his family having been for three generations engineers to the Board of Northern
        Light houses. He however failed to make a success of that profession and abandoned
        it for the law. He was called to the Scottish bar, but received only one brief.
        He afterwards travelled con siderably, visiting San Francisco as an immigrant,
        since which time he has been an invalid and has devoted himself to novel writing.
        His poetical works are A Child''s Garland of Verse, 1885 ; Undenvoods, 1887',

        "Camden''s Britannia," who was some time vicar of Lambeth, andialso librarian
        here. This catalogue is de posed in the manuscript library. In 1 718 it was
        fairly copied by Dr. Wilkins, in three folio volumes, and has been continued
        by his successors to the present time. In 1 873-4 the whole of the books and
        manuscripts underwent a complete repair, by a special grant from the Ecclesiastical
        Commissioners. A building of modem date, adjacent to the library, serves as
        the manuscript-room ; it was put into thorough repair a few years ago, and
        rendered fire-proof. Here are preserved some 1,300 manu scripts of the highest
        interest, together with the records of the palace, which are kept in patent
        " Reliance " safes. Some of the documents date from a very early time, and
        one of them, it is alleged, bears the signature of Canute. THE CHAMBER IN
        LAMBETH PALACE IN WHICH THE LOLLARDS WERE CONFINEI It may be added that the
        archbishop allows the library to be open to students, and, indeed, to all
        respectable persons, on application, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday during
        the year, vacations excepted. Among the " curiosities " of Lambeth Palace
        preserved in the manuscript-room is the habit of a priest, consisting of a
        stole, maniple, chasuble ; cord, two bands marked P, and the corporal; also
        a crucifix of base metal, a string of beads, and a box of relics. Here also
        is kept the shell of a tortoise, believed to have lived in the palace gardens
        from the time of Laud (1633) to 1753, Before quitting the hall, we may remark
        that a stone on the building gives the date of the erection 1685 ; but a leaden
        pipe attached to the walls, running from the roof to the ground, to carry
        off rain-water, bears the date 1663. The pipe appears to be in a very good
        state of preservation ; and a coat-of-arms, supposed to be that of Bishop
        Juxon, can he plainly observed on it. To account for the difference in date,
        it is supposed that the pipe longed to an older building which stood on the
        site of the present structure. __, . when it perished by the negligence of
        the gardener ; the shell is ten inches in length, and six and a half inches
        in breadth. From the south-east corner of the hall a flight of stairs leads
        up to the Guard-chamber; it is a large state room, fifty-six feet long by
        twenty-seven feet wide, and is so called from having formerly contained the
        armour and arms appropriated to 277', 1]

        \ a lion and a kid. The house was known as the \" Lion and Goat.\" Cologne\
        \ \u2014 a shield, with a pair of compasses, an axe, and a dray, or truck,\
        \ with goats for supporters. \"In a country like England, dealing so much\
        \ at one time in Rhenish wine, a more likely origin,' he observes, \" could\
        \ hardly be imagined.\" Mr. Larwood, however, points out that possibly the\
        \ \" Goat \" was the original sign, and that the host afterwards added the\
        \ Masonic \" Compasses,\" as is often done now. At the bottom of Grosvenor\
        \ Place, and reaching to Buckingham Palace Road, is a large triangular piece\
        \ of ground, intersected by a part of Ebury Street, and covered with lofty\
        \ and handsomely constructed houses, known respectively as Gros venor Gardens\
        \ and Belgrave Mansions. On the east side of this triangular plot is Arabella\
        \ Row, one side of which is occupied by the royal stables of Buckingham Palace,\
        \ which we have already de scribed.* This row was once, not so very long ago,\
        \ well tenanted. Among others, here lived Lord Erskine, after he had ceased\
        \ to hold the seals as Lord Chancellor. His lordship, who held them only a\
        \ year, was not only an orator, but a wit, as the following anecdote will\
        \ show : \u2014 Captain Parry was once at dinner in his company, when Lord\
        \ Erskine asked him what he and his crew lived upon in the Frozen Sea. Parry\
        \ said that they lived upon seals. \" And capital things, too, seals are,\
        \ if you only keep them long enough,\" was the reply. One of the houses in\
        \ Arabella Row is the official residence of the Queen's Librarian at Windsor\
        \ Castle. Belgrave Square, into which we now pass, was so named after the\
        \ Viscountcy of Belgrave, the second title of Earl Grosvenor before he was\
        \ raised to his superior rank. It was built in the year 1825, and covers an\
        \ area of about ten acres. It was designed by George Basevi, the detached\
        \ mansions at the angles being the work of Hardwick, Kendall, and others.\
        \ It is nearly 700 feet in length by a little over 600. The houses are uniform,\
        \ except the large detached mansions at the angles. Those in the sides are\
        \ adorned with Corinthian columns and capitals. Belgrave Square has always\
        \ been occupied by the heads of the highest titled nobility, and by many foreigners\
        \ of distinction. Lord Ellesmere lived here till he built Bridgewater House.\
        \ Among other notabilities who have resided here may be named the first Lord\
        \ Combermere, Sir Roderick Murchison, the geologist, Sir Charles Wood, afterwards\
        \ Lord Halifax, and General Sir George Murray, who acted as Quartermaster-General\
        \ to the British army during the Peninsular War. At the south-west corner\
        \ lived for some years another dis tinguished General, Lord Hill, the hero\
        \ of Almarez. In this square the Count de Chambord and his mother held their\
        \ court, during a short visit which they paid to England in 1S43. The Austrian\
        \ Embassy has been for several years located in this square. At the corner\
        \ of Arabella Row and Buckingham Palace Road, is a public-house, rejoicing\
        \ in the once common sign of the \" Bag o' Nails \" \u2014 a per version of\
        \ \" The Bacchanals \" of Ben Jonson. \" About fifty years ago,\" writes the\
        \ author of \"Tavern Anecdotes,\" in 1825, \"the original sign might have\
        \ been seen at the front of the house ; it was a Satyr of the Woods, with\
        \ a group of 'jolly dogs,' ycleped Bacchanals. But the Satyr having been painted\
        \ black, and with cloven feet, it was called by the common people ' The Devil\
        \ ; ' while the Bacchanalian revellers were transmuted, by a comic process,\
        \ into the ' Bag of Nails.'\" In Chapel Street, which runs from the south-east\
        \ corner of Belgrave Square into Grosvenor Place, resided Mr. Richard Jones,\
        \ a teacher of elocution, generally known as \" Gentleman Jones,\" who is\
        \ mentioned by Lord William Lennox, and by nearly all the writers of modern\
        \ London anecdote. Here he used to have scores of pupils practising for the\
        \ pulpit, the bar, or the senate. \" Under his able tuition,\" says Lord W.\
        \ Lennox, \" many a reverend gentleman, who mumbled over the service, became\
        \ a shining light ; many an embryo lawyer, who spoke as if he had a ball of\
        \ worsted in his mouth, became a great orator ; and many a member of Parliament,\
        \ who ' hummed and hawed,' and was unintelligible in the gallery, turned out\
        \ a dis tinguished speaker.\" In Grosvenor Row, a thoroughfare which has disappeared\
        \ in the march of modem improvements that have recently taken place in this\
        \ neighbour hood, was another inn, \"The Three Compasses,\" well known as\
        \ a starting-point for the Pimlico omnibuses. It was generally known as the\
        \ \"Goat and Compasses\" \u2014 possibly a corruption of the text, \"God encompasseth\
        \ us ;\" though Mr. P. Cun ningham sees in it a reproduction of the arms of\
        \ the Wine Coopers' Company, as they appear on a vault in the Church of S.\
        \ Maria di Capitolo, at Eccleston Street derives its name from Eccleston,\

    - ["Lambeth Palace] THE ARCHIEPISCOPAL LIBRARY. 431 library of bookes of divinity,\
        \ and of many other sorts of learning,\" provided they bound themselves to\
        \ the necessary assurances for the continuance of such books to the archbishops\
        \ successively ; other- wise, they were to be bequeathed to the \" publique\
        \ library of the University of Cambridge.\" Bancroft's successor \u2014 Archbishop\
        \ Abbot (1611-33) \u2014 carried out these injunctions, and left his own books\
        \ to the Lambeth library. But the civil war marked the crisis in the history\
        \ of the collection, for when the Parliamentarians were about to seize on\
        \ Lam- beth Palace, the learned Selden, fearing the danger of total dispersion,\
        \ suggested to the University of Cambridge their right to the books, in accordance\
        \ with Bancroft's will, as above mentioned. Very few of Archbishop Laud's\
        \ books are here, nearly all of them having been presented to the library\
        \ of St. John's College, Oxford. To Cambridge the Lambeth books were transferred\
        \ and preserved, until, at the Restoration, they were recalled by Archbishop\
        \ Juxon (1660-3). That primate's death occurring before the books could be\
        \ restored, it was left to his successor, Archbishop Sheldon, to see them\
        \ replaced at Lambeth. This primate pre- sented many books to the library\
        \ ; but not so his successor, Archbishop Sancroft, who, although he had many\
        \ of the MSS. re-bound and preserved, yet on his resignation presented his\
        \ collection to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, of which he had been master.\
        \ From Archbishop Tillotson (1691-5) we hear of no bequests ; but his successor,\
        \ Arch- bishop Tenison, bequeathed a portion of his library to Lambeth, a\
        \ part to St. Paul's Cathedral, and the remainder to the library which he\
        \ had founded in St. Martin's-in-the-Fields.* From 1716 to 1757, when the\
        \ see of Canterbury was filled by the primates Wake, Potter, Herring, and\
        \ Hutton, few additions were made ; but Archbishop Seeker, who followed next\
        \ in order, will be gratefully remem- bered in the library annals as having\
        \ given all the books in his own library, which included also many interesting\
        \ pamphlets, to the archiepiscopal collection. To Archbishop Cornwallis we\
        \ are in- debted for presenting and causing the extensive collection of tracts\
        \ to be bound and arranged. The names of Archbishops Manners-Sutton (1805-28)\
        \ and Howley (1828-48) are associated with large bequests of theological lore\
        \ to the library. The great hall was converted to its present use by Archbishop\
        \ Howley in 1 834, previously to which time the books were arranged in some\
        \ galleries 1 over the cloisters which were then standing. The 1 bequests\
        \ of successive primates are generally dis- j tinguished by their arms or\
        \ initials on the outside ; cover of the books, while autographs and memoranda\
        \ ; on the title-pages record noted names, and supply j links of ownership.\
        \ Among those autographs may j be found the names of Cranmer ; Foxe, the \"\
        \ mar- tyrologist ;\" Tillotson ; Tenison ; Henry Wotton, the well-known writer\
        \ on architecture ; the more famous one of Charles L, attached to a \" Life\
        \ of Archbishop Laud ;\" and several of less note. It is in this way that\
        \ the interest of the books is iden- tified with much that is historical.\
        \ An exhaustive j catalogue of the library and art treasures in the palace,\
        \ with a full description of its illuminated manuscripts and ancient chronicles,\
        \ was published in 1873 by the Archbishop's librarian, Mr. S. W. Kershaw.\
        \ Space does not admit of our entering at any great length into a description\
        \ of the varied contents of this library; but we may state that among the\
        \ ancient printed books is one of great rarity : this is \" The Chronicles\
        \ of Great Britain,\" and was printed by Caxton at Westminster in 14S0. There\
        \ are about five other works printed by Caxton in the library, although imperfect.\
        \ The \" Golden Legend,\" printed by the celebrated Wynkyn de Worde, also\
        \ finds a place here ; as also does the \" Nuremberg Chronicle \" (the library\
        \ had two copies), and the fifteenth century MSS., known as the \"St. Alban's\
        \ Chronicle.\" Of illuminated MSS., there are about thirty examples of the\
        \ various styles of art in this library ; one of the most rare being the little\
        \ MS. known as the \" Gospels of Mac Du-rnan,\" written about the year 900,\
        \ and presented by King Athelstan to the City of Can terbury. The school of\
        \ English art is represented most notably in the copy of the New Testament,\
        \ printed on vellum, known as the \" Mazarine,\" from the fact of the first\
        \ copy having been dis covered in the library of that cardinal. This Mazarine\
        \ Bible is of great rarity and value. About twenty-four copies are known,\
        \ four being on vellum. Another interesting example of English art is a MS.\
        \ known as the \" Dictyes and Sayings of the Philosophers ; \" and in this\
        \ illumina tion the author is represented as introducing a tonsured personage,\
        \ who presents a copy of the work to King Edward IV, accompanied by his queen\
        \ and their son, afterwards Edward V. AVal pole, in his \" Royal and Noble\
        \ Authors,\" has given an engraving of this miniature, and it has also been\
        \ engraved by Strutt. There is in the library only one book which is known\
        \ for certain to have belonged to Archbishop Parker, and that is a treatise\
        \ entitled \" De Anti quitate et Privilegiis Ecclesi\xE6 Cantuarensis.\" The\
        \ library contains, inter alia, an original impression \u2022 See Vol. III.,\

        to follow her own sweet will and find amusement from her own resources. A
        visitor, however, she did have. She was sitting in the library one morning,
        turning over the large coloured plates of a work showing all the famous racehorses
        from Eclipse downwards, when a footstep startled her, and turning round she
        found a little shabby-looking man with bushy eye brows and blinking eyes.
        " How do you do, Canon Royan?" " You are early at work this morning," he purred,
        as they shook hands. " I used to consider myself librarian and reading public
        in one here ; but evidently you also are a bibliophile." " Perhaps you can
        help me to find what I want," she said eagerly, for his weak etiolated eyes
        had all the friendliness of a cat''s. " What is it ? Ah, a student of hippology

        at a time, which were called Hightum, Tightum, and Scrub. The first was her
        best, the next her second best, and the third her every-day one. Miss Banks
        could be a little crusty when she was put out, and on one occasion, when a
        distinguished man came to Soho Square a quarter of an hour before dinner-time,
        and caught her putting away her '' things,'' she gave him a very sharp answer.
        The visitor made the innocent remark, '' It''s a fine day, ma''am;'' to which
        Miss Banks answered, '' I know nothing about it; you must speak to my brother
        upon that subject when you are at dinner.'' Sir Joseph Banks presented his
        library and collections to the British Museum, where they will be preserved
        for ever for the use of students. His librarians were, first, Dr. Solander
        (whose chief property was said to consist in the possession of a large number
        of dress waist coats), Dr. Dryander, usually known as '' Old Dry,'' and, lastly,
        Robert Brown (the Botanicorum facile Princeps of Alexander von Humboldt),
        to whom Banks left a life interest in his library and collections. The Linnean
        Society, whose librarian Brown then was, moved to this house from Gerrard
        Street about the year 1822, and continued in it until 1857, when they transferred
        themselves to their present quarters at Burlington House. This house is now
        the Hospital for Diseases of the Heart. Among the eminent inhabitants of this
        locality at an early period was Lord Berkeley, who, according to Hatton, in
        1708 hack his house '' on the east side of King''s Square.'' This nobleman
        was not possessed with an overabundance of amiability, if we may judge from
        one circumstance in his career. It is well known that such was the hatred
        of George I. to his son that he would willingly have listened to any scheme,
        however detestable, which would enable him to rid himself of his heir. Certain
        it is that, after his death, a paper was found in his cabinet containing an
        infamous proposal of the Earl of Berkeley to carry off the prince to America,

        \ the feeling of reserve that was stealing over her in regard to Miss Lethwait,\
        \ or why it should be so strong. She went down to the carriage, which waited\
        \ at the door, and was driven away. A grand carriage, resplendent in its coroneted\
        \ panels, its hammer-cloth, and its servants with their wigs, their powder,\
        \ their gold-headed canes. Jane quite shrank from the display, considering\
        \ the errand upon which she was bent. She had no difficulty whatever in finding\
        \ the library she was in search of, and was driven to it. But she had a difficulty\
        \ in her way of another sort : she knew not by what name to inquire for her\
        \ sister. Clarice had desired her to address her letters \" Miss Chesney,\"\
        \ but told her at the same time that it was not the name by which she was\
        \ known. Jane went into the shop and the proprietor came forward. \" Can you\
        \ tell me where a young lady resides of the name of Chesney ? \" she inquired.\
        \ \" She is governess in a family.\" \"Chesney? \u2014 Chesney? \"was the\
        \ answer, spoken in consideration. \" No, ma'am ; I do not know any one of\
        \ the name.\" Jane paused. \" Some letters have been occasionally addressed\
        \ here for her ; for Miss Chesney ; and I believe she used to fetch them away\
        \ herself.\" \" Oh yes, that was Miss Beauchamp,\" was the answer, the speaker's\
        \ face lighting up with remembrance. \" I beg your pardon, ma'am; I thought\
        \ you said Miss Chesney. The letters were addressed to a Miss Chesney, and\
        \ Miss Beauchamp used to come for them.\" Beauchamp ! The problem was solved\
        \ at once, and Jane won dered at her own stupidity in not solving it before.\
        \ What more natural than that Clarice should take her second name \u2014 Beau\
        \ champ? She was named Clarice Beauchamp Chesney. And Jane had strayed amid\
        \ a whole directory of names over and over again, without the most probable\
        \ one ever occurring to her mind. \" Thank you, yes,\" she said ; \" Miss\
        \ Beauchamp. Can you direct me to her residence ? \" \" No, ma'am. I really\
        \ cannot,\" was the reply. \" Miss Beauchamp was governess in two families\
        \ in succession, both of them residing in Gloucester Terrace, but I do not\
        \ think she stayed long with either. She was at Mrs. Lorton's first, and at\
        \ Mrs. West's afterwards.\" Jane had not known that; Clarice had never told\
        \ her of having changed her situation. \" I suppose we must both be speaking\
        \ of the same person,\" she suddenly cried. \" Perhaps you will describe her\
        \ to me ? \" \"Willingly,\" answered the librarian. And the description was\
        \ so accurate that Jane instantly recognized it for her sister's. \" Miss\
        \ Beauchamp disappeared from the neighbourhood suddenly", 1]

        \ she ceased coming here. We have two or three letters with the same address\
        \ waiting still.\" Jane wondered whether they could be those she had sent.\
        \ She asked to see them, and he brought them forward : three. They were the\
        \ same. \" I will take them away with me,\" said Jane. The librarian hesitated\
        \ at this\u2014 not unnaturally. \" You will pardon me, I am sure, ma'am,\
        \ if I inquire by what authority you would take them ? Miss Beauchamp may\
        \ call for them yet.\" Jane smiled. \" They were written by me,\" she said,\
        \ tearing open one of the letters and showing him the signature. \" And,\"\
        \ she added, taking out her card-case and handing him a card, \" that will\
        \ prove that I am Jane Chesney.\" The librarian bowed ; and intimated that\
        \ her ladyship was of course at liberty to do what she pleased with her own\
        \ letters. \" Upon second thoughts, I will leave this one, the last written,\
        \ and write upon it our present address,\" said Jane. \" As you observe, Miss\
        \ Beauchamp may yet call here.\" Obtaining the address of the two families\
        \ in which she was told Miss Beauchamp had served, Lady Jane quitted the shop,\
        \ and walked on to Gloucester Terrace, ordering the carriage to follow her\
        \ by-and-by. She reached the house occupied by the Lortons first, and inquired\
        \ of a showy footman whether Mrs. Lorton was at home. The answer was given\
        \ in the affirmative, but with some hesitation : it was earlier than the orthodox\
        \ hour for receiving visitors, and the man probably doubted whether his mistress\
        \ was presentable. Jane was shown into an excessively smart room, and after\
        \ some delay an excessively smart lady came to her ; but neither room nor\
        \ lady possessed anything of refinement. Jane had not given her name. \" It\
        \ is of no consequence : I am a stranger,\" she said to the servant when he\
        \ inquired. Mrs. Lorton dropped Jane a swimming curtsey, and sailing to a\
        \ large velvet ottoman in the middle of the room, took her seat upon it. Jane\
        \ looked, as she ever did, a lady, and Mrs. Lorton was all smiles and suavity.\
        \ \" I have called to inquire if you can kindly give me any informa tion as\
        \ to the present address of a young lady who lived with you as governess,\"\
        \ began Jane. \" A Miss Beauchamp.\" Mrs. Lorton's smiles froze at the question.\
        \ \" I know nothing about Miss Beauchamp,\" she answered, somewhat rudely.\
        \ \" She did not behave well in my house, and it was a good riddance when\
        \ she left it.\" \" Not behave well ! \" echoed Jane. \" No, she did not.\

        as she spoke those words. Her voice had been somewhat raised, and no doubt
        carried further than she thought of in the crisp, clear air. But as she ceased

        chant that rose and fell, and this was the burden of it : On two sonnes will

        beside us. " What can it mean ? " gasped Loveday, her scared eyes peering
        here and there, and her slight figure trembling as she leaned against me.
        I was scarcely less alarmed than herself, though I tried to persuade her that
        perchance some ploughboy or farm-help was hiding in the adjoining field, and
        had croaked this by way of jest. But Loveday shook her head ; her white lips
        betrayed her terror. " Don''t you know," she said, " that the verse we heard

    - ['8 LILITII CHAPTER II THE MIRROR Nothing more happened for some days. I think
        it was about a week after, when what I have now to tell took place. I had
        often thought of the manuscript fragment, and repeatedly tried to discover
        some way of releasing it, but in vain : I could not find out what held it
        fast. But I had for some time intended a thorough overhauling of the books
        in the closet, its atmosphere causing me uneasiness as to their condition.
        One day the intention suddenly became a resolve, and I was in the act of rising
        from my chair to make a beginning, when I saw the old librarian moving from
        the door of the closet toward the farther end of the room. I ought rather
        to say only that I caught sight of something shadowy from which I received
        the impression of a slight, stooping man, in a shabby dress-coat reaching
        almost to his heels, the tails of which, disparting a little as he walked,
        revealed thin legs in black stockings, and large feet in wide, slipper-like
        shoes. At once I followed him : I might be following a shadow, but I never
        doubted I was following something. He went out of the library into the hall,
        and across to the foot of the great staircase, then up the stairs', 1]

        feared her. The instant the princess entered, I heard a buzzing sound as of
        many low voices, and, one portion after another, the assembly began to be
        shiftingly illuminated, as by a ray that went travelling from spot to spot.
        Group after group would shine out for a space, then sink back into the general
        vagueness, while another part of the vast company would grow momently bright.
        Some of the actions going on when thus illuminated, were not unknown to me
        ; I bad been in them, or had looked on them, and so had the princess : present
        with every one of them I now saw her. The skull-beaded dancers footed tbe

        ! The fight went on in the Evil AVood : there was the princess urging it !

        sunk on her bosom. The con fused murmur continued, the confused commotion
        of colours and shapes ; and still the ray went shifting and showing. It settled
        at last on the hollow in the heath, and there was the princess, walking up
        and down, and trying in vain to wrap the vapour around her ! Then first I
        was startled at what I saw : the old librarian walked up to her, and stood
        for a moment re garding her ; she fell ; her limbs forsook her and fled ;
        her body vanished. A wild shriek rang through the echoing place, and with
        the fall of her eidolon, the princess herself, till then standing like a statue
        in front of me, fell heavily, and lay still. I turned at once and went out

        \ process. In 1439 he was associated with two arti sans of the city of Strasbourg,\
        \ ostensibly in the fabrication of mirrors, which may be otherwise understood\
        \ as printing of ' Speculums,' the Latin word signifying the same thing. .\
        \ . . Three problems presented themselves to him. He wanted types less fragile\
        \ than wooden types and less costly than engraving. He wanted a press by the\
        \ aid of which he could obtain a clear impres sion on parchment or paper.\
        \ He desired also that the leaves of his books should not be anopis tograph,\
        \ or printed only on one side. . . . Until then, and even long after, the\
        \ xylographs were printed ' au frotton,' or with a brush, rubbing the paper\
        \ upon the forme coated with ink, thicker than ordinary ink. He dreamed of\
        \ something better. In the course of his work John Gutenberg re turned to\
        \ Mayence. The idea of publishing a Bible, the Book of books, had taken possession\
        \ of his heart. . . . The cutting of his types had ruined him. ... In this\
        \ unhappy situation, Gutenberg made the acquaintance of a financier of Mayence,\
        \ named Fust, . . . who put a sum of 1,100 florins at his disposal to continue\
        \ his ex periments. Unfortunately this money disap peared, it melted away,\
        \ and the results obtained were absolutely ludicrous. . . . About this time\
        \ a third actor enters on the scene. Peter Schoef fer, of Gernsheim, a writer,\
        \ introduced into the workshop of Gutenberg to design letters, bene fited\
        \ by the abortive experiments, and taking up the invention at its dead-lock,\
        \ conducted it to success. John of Tritenheim, called Trithemius, the learned\
        \ abbot of Spanheim, is the person who relates these facts ; but as he got\
        \ his information from Schoeffer himself, too much credence must not be given\
        \ to his statements. Besides, Schoef fer was not at all an ordinary artisan.\
        \ If we credit a Strasbourg manuscript written by his hand in 1449, he was\
        \ a student of the ' most glorious university of Paris.'\" How much Schoeffer\
        \ contributed to the working out of the invention is a matter of conjecture;\
        \ but in 1454 it was advanced to a state in which the first known application\
        \ of it in practical use was made. This was in the printing of copies of the\
        \ famous letters of indulgence which Pope Nicholas V. was then selling throughout\
        \ Europe. Having the so far perfected invention in hand, Fust and Schoeffer\
        \ (the latter now having married the former's granddaughter) wished to rid\
        \ them selves of Gutenberg. \"Fust had a most easy pretext, which was to demand\
        \ purely and simply from his associate the sums advanced by him, and which\
        \ had produced so little. Guten berg had probably commenced his Bible, but,\
        \ in face of the claims of Fust, he had to abandon it altogether, types, formes,\
        \ and press. In November, 1455, he had retired to a little house outside the\
        \ city, where he tried his best, by the aid of foreign help, to establish\
        \ a workshop, and to preserve the most perfect secrecy. Relieved of his company,\
        \ Fust and Schoeffer were able to take up the impression of the Bible and\
        \ to com plete it without him. . . . One thing is certain: that the Bible\
        \ of Schoeffer, commenced by Gutenberg or not, put on sale by Fust and Schoeffer\
        \ alone about the end of 1455 or be ginning of 1456, proves to be the first\
        \ completed book. ... It is now called the Mazarine Bible, from the fact that\
        \ the copy in the Mazarin Li \u2022 brary was the first to give evidence concerning\
        \ it. The book was put on sale at the end of 1455 or beginning of 1456, for\
        \ a manuscript note of a vicar of St. Stephen at Mayence records that he finished\
        \ the binding and illuminating of the first volume on St. Bartholomew's Day\
        \ [June 13], 1456, and the second on the 15th of August. . . . All these remarks\
        \ show that the printers did not proclaim themselves, and were making pseudo-manuscripts.\
        \ . . . Many of the copies are illuminated with as much care and beauty as\
        \ if they were the finest manuscripts. . . . Copies are by no means uncommon,\
        \ most of the great libraries having one, and many are in private collections.\
        \ \"\u2014 H. Bouchot, The Printed Book, ch. 1. \u2014 \"The general consent\
        \ of all nations in ascribing the honour of the invention of printing to Gutenberg\
        \ seems at first sight a very strong argument in his favour ; but if Gutenberg\
        \ were not the first to invent and use movable types, but the clever man who\
        \ brought to perfection what already existed in a crude state, we can quite\
        \ imagine his fame to have spread \u2022 every- where as the real inventor.\
        \ As a master in the art of printing, Gutenberg's name was known in Paris\
        \ so early as 1472. . . . Mr. Hessels ... be- lieves that the Coster mentioned\
        \ in the archives as living in Haarlem, 1436-83, was the inventor of types,\
        \ and that, taken as a whole, the story as told by Jifnius is substantially\
        \ correct. Person- ally I should like to wait for more evidence. There is\
        \ no doubt that the back-bone of the Dutch claim lies in the pieces and fragments\
        \ of old books discovered for the most part in the last few decades, and which\
        \ give support to, at the same time that they receive support from, the Cologne\
        \ Chronicler. . . . These now amount to forty-seven different works. Their\
        \ number is being added to continually now that the atten- tion of librarians\
        \ has been strongly called to the importance of noting and preserving them.\
        \ They have been catalogued with profound insight by Mr. Hessels, and for\
        \ the first time classified by internal evidence into their various types\
        \ and classes. But, it may well be asked, what evi- dence is there that all\
        \ these books were not printed long after Gutenberg's press was at work 1\
        \ . . . The earliest book of Dutch printing bears date 1473, and not a single\
        \ edition out of all the so-called Costeriana has any printer's name or place\
        \ or date. To this the reply is, that these small pieces were school-books\
        \ or absies and such-like works, in the production of which there was nothing\
        \ to boast of, as there would be in a Bible. Such things were at all times\
        \ 'sine ulla nota,' and certain to be destroyed when done with, so that the\
        \ wonder would be to find them so dated, and the very fact of their bearing\
        \ a date would go far to prove them not genuine. These fragments have been\
        \ nearly all discovered in 15th-century books, printed mostly in various towns\
        \ of Holland. . . . Mr. Hessels quotes forty-seven different books as 'Costeri-\
        \ ana,' which include four editions of the Specu- lum, nineteen of Donatus,\
        \ and seven of Doctrin ale. The Donatuses are in five different types, probably\
        \ from five different Dutch presses. Compared with the earliest dated books\
        \ of 1473 and onwards, printed in Holland, they have nothing in common, while\
        \ their brotherhood to the Dutch MSS. and block-books of about thirty years\
        \ earlier is apparent. Just as astronomers have been unable to explain certain\
        \ aberrations of the planets without surmising a missing link in the chain\
        \ of their knowledge, so is it with", 1]

    - ['INTRODUCTION XXII Hon. A. M. Mackay, and D. Ryan. To my eldest son I am indebted
        for notes, views, and maps, collected chiefly at the British Museum and the
        Record Office ; and I have also to thank especially the autho rities of the
        British Museum, the librarian at Hatfield, Mr. R. T. Gunton, Mr. Sutcliffe,
        Mr. Reddan, and other friends who have assisted my son in England. The illustrations,
        except where otherwise stated, are from photographs taken by our excellent
        photographer, Mr. S. H. Parsons, to whom I am indebted for permission to reproduce
        them. Our best known writer, the Rev. Dr. M. Harvey, has written a very able
        paper on the Fishery Commission. I am painfully conscious, after all the labour,
        time, and money spent on the work, that it is still a very incomplete history
        of New foundland. To write a full history would require several voium s, and
        more time and expenditure than I could afford to bestow on it If, however,
        I have thrown any fresh light on the tangled story of our Colony, if any of
        my fellow countrymen are led, by its perusal, to take more interest in this
        "Newfoundland of Ours," and to understand her history better, I shall feel
        amply repaid for all the pains I have taken in its preparation. Manj* of my
        readers no doubt feel surprised at the long delay in the publication of this
        work ; it has been caused by various circumstances over which I had no control
        (public and private business), but principally by the desire to acquire fuller
        information. My American friends strongly advised me to make haste slowly,
        and I have followed their advice to some extent, having been six years constantly
        employed on the work. Some of my Newfoundland readers would probably like
        to know how this book came into existence. In 1888 I found myself suddenly
        transformed from a peaceful district judge into a fighting admiral. In carrying
        out the bait-protection seivice, in order to while away the tedious time on
        board ship, I wrote some papers on "The Home of the Herring " ; their favourable
        reception induced me to com mence a short " History of the Newfoundland Fishery."
        After thirty years'' experience and extensive reading on the subject, I found
        that I really knew practically nothing about our island history, and that
        the real history could only be acquired by much study and research ; these
        investigations resulted in the present work. The labour was so enor mous that
        I have several times dropped it in despair. At one time I intended to end
        at 1713; however, I suppose West Country obstinacy prevailed, so amid much
        interruption I completed it, with manifold assistance, which I acknowledge
        with most sincere gratitude. I will conclude in the words of a fellow-countryman,
        who, when asked to give information to a parliamentary committee on the fishery,',

        \ The Newspapers of To-Day PON the fourth of March, 177*, the first newspaper\
        \ published in the State, Isaac Collins' \"New Jersey Gazette,\" was removed\
        \ to Trenton. The journal had been established in Burlington City during the\
        \ previous December. The printing office was located on the corner of State\
        \ and Broad streets \u2014 the Park Row of this city \u2014 and whilst there\
        \ located the \"Gazette\" enjoyed official patronage, and was in fact the\
        \ mouthpiece of William Livingston, the patriot Governor of the Revolution.\
        \ Owing to insufficient patronage the paper was discontinued in November,\
        \ 17*<i. Early in the summer of 17*7, the \"Federal Post or the Trenton Weekly\
        \ Mercury\" was first issued on AVarren street, nearly opposite Saint Michael's\
        \ Church. In consequence of a scarcity of paper in October, 17**, its size\
        \ was reduced, and it was issued semi-weekly. It later became a weekly, and\
        \ soon thereafter its career was terminated. From the contributions of the\
        \ late John O. Raum, the following outline has been abridged : The \" True\
        \ American \" began its career in March, 1801, being issued by Matthias Day\
        \ and Jacob Mann. Upon the entrance into the partnership of ex-Senator James\
        \ J. Wilson, Air. Day retired, and in 1803 Mr. Mann also dissolved his connection\
        \ with the firm, and until 1*11 the j.aj.er was published by Wilson V BlackweU.\
        \ Air. Wilson then continued the paper until bis death. After other changes\
        \ in ownership the \" True American \" was purchased by George Sherman, of\
        \ the \" State Gazette,\" and was discontinued. Within a short time the paper\
        \ was again issued, ami after various changes jiassed into the hands of Morris\
        \ R. Hamilton, now State Librarian. In 1*52, the \" True American \" became\
        \ the property of ex-Judge David Naar, with Franklin S. Mills as associate\
        \ editor. In 1866, it was purchased by Aloses D. Naar, Joshua S. Day and Joseph\
        \ L. Naar, who issued it from the corner of State and Broad streets. Air.\
        \ Joseph L. Naar subsequently became the owner, and under his editorship the\
        \ journal has been issued from the corner of State and Broad streets, in the\
        \ Lincoln Building, and from its present thoroughly-equipped office on North\
        \ Warren street. Under Air. Naar the paper has become metropolitan in its\
        \ features. An attempt was made in 1*21, by ex-Justice of the Supreme Court\
        \ Stacy (I. Potts and Joseph Justice, State Printer, to publish a religious\
        \ and literary paper. This was the \"Emporium.\" Its publication office was\
        \ on North Warren street, opposite AVest Hanover. It was continued as a literary\
        \ jiajie-r until 1*27, when it took sides with the administration, and came\
        \ out as a Jackson sheet. Mr. Potts continued to edit the paper until 1*30,\
        \ when, being appointed, by the Joint Meeting, Clerk in Chancery, his connection\
        \ with the paper was dissolved, after which time Air. Justice was the jitiblisher\

        \ on Rules. In cataloguing the library, they found one hundred anel sixty-eight\
        \ volumes. In 1813, the first act was passed relative to the State Library,\
        \ and in 1822, for the first time, a joint meeting created the office of State\
        \ Librarian. Previ ous to this time, the Clerk of the House had control of\
        \ the books. A Law Library Association, a close corporation, composed of members\
        \ of the bar, kept their library in the Supreme Court room until 1837, when\

    - ['THE CITY OF TRENTON. 145 Morris R. Hamilton, State Librarian, is a native
        of this State, having been born at Oxford Furnace, Sussex county, May 24th,
        1820. His father, Samuel It. Hamilton, was Quartermaster- General of New Jersey
        for twenty-five years, and was a prominent citizen of Trenton. He- traces
        his ancestry to John Hamilton, who was Provincial Governor of this State from
        1736 to 1747, and to Andrew Robeson, who was Surveyor-General of the Province
        at the same time. The original immigrants were residents of Scotland, whence
        they emigrated to America about 1700. Colonel Hamilton was educated at the
        Trenton Academy, and prepared for college at the Lawrenceville Classical and
        Commercial High School. In 1839, he graduated from the College of New Jersey.
        Immediately after completing his college course, he commenced the study of
        law with his father, at Trenton, and in 1842 he was admitted to the bar. For
        two years he was engaged in the practice of his profession in Camden, New
        Jersey. From 1844 to 1849, he filled a position in the Philadelphia post-office.
        A desire for literary life led him to resign his clerical position and accept
        the position of editor of the "True American," published in this city. This
        was the commencement of a successful and brilliant newspaper career, lasting
        over forty years. In 1853, the " True American " was sold to Judge Naar, who
        became its editor. Other positions were at once offered Colonel Hamilton,
        and he has since been connected with several prominent dailies, both in the
        East and West. Governor Fort appointed him < in his pers< mal staff, with
        the rank of Colonel, and he served in that capacity from 1851 to 1854. On
        February 27th, 1**4, he was elected State Librarian, anel since has held that
        posi tion. He is the most thoroughly qualified Librarian that New Jersey has
        ever had. His large experience in general literary work anel his extensive
        knowledge of law are invaluable to him in his present position. Colonel Hamilton,
        although well advanced in years, is a very active man, and is still a familiar
        figure in political and social circles. He is prominently con nected with
        Concordia Lodge, No. 4, I. 0. O. F., of this city, and is a Mason, holding
        his membership with Loelge No. 15, of Camden, New Jersey. In 1844, Ceilonel
        Hamilton was married to Harriet P. Halstead, of Newark, a granddaughter of
        Governor Pennington. Of his four sons, the eldest, Captain Ellis Hamilton,
        e.f the Fifteenth New Jersey Regiment, was fatally wounded at the battle of
        the Wilderness, and the youngest, Harry, was widely known as an Actuary of
        Insurance anel translator of Virgil and Saunders'' Medi- cal Dictionary. His
        two living sons are quite distinguished men; one of them, Fritz, being an
        artist of recognized ability, at Louisville, Kentucky, and the other, Frank,
        connected with the United States Navy Department, at Washington, D. C. His
        daughters, of whom he has three, are all married, and reside, one in Newark,
        the other two in this city. Great Seal of New Jersey. The office of the Secretary
        of State, at the Capitol, contains the original Great Seal of New Jersey,
        together with the resolution providing for its adoption. The present Great
        Seal was ordered by the General Assemply anel Council, sitting in Princeton,
        September 6th, 1776. On October 3d, 1776, Francis Hopkinson, the "Signer,"
        was ordered to employ a proper person in Philadelphia to prepare the silver
        seal of the State. This symbol of State authority was to be round, two anel
        one-half inches in diameter and three-eighths of an inch thick. The arms were
        three plows in an escutcheon, the supporters Liberty and Ceres anel the crest

        \ free school move ment the meeting of the Apprentices' Library Company, on\
        \ April 20th, 1*22, is of particular interest. On that occasion a meeting\
        \ of the citizens of Trenton was held at the house of Joseph M. Bispham, Trenton\
        \ House. The following gentlemen were deeply interested in the movement :\
        \ Charles Ewing, Samuel L. Southard, Zachariah Rossell, George Watson, Samuel\
        \ Evans, James J. Wilson, Rev. Abiel Carter, Rev. William Boswell, Thomas\
        \ Gordon, Daniel Coleman, Charles Burroughs and William S. Stockton. Upon\
        \ the opening night thirty-five volumes were taken out. Two hundred and fifty\
        \ books were displayed on cases, which cost the company S1 .0. These works\
        \ were of tin good, old-fashioned kind, containing no neivels, romances or\
        \ plays, which are so apt to captivate juvenile imaginations, but were composed\
        \ of works of more sterling value and lasting usefulness \u2014 on religion,\
        \ morality and science, history, biography, travels, voyages, et similiter.\
        \ The society con tinued for many years, when the late Librarian Samuel Evans\
        \ gave the books into the charge of the Young Men's Christian Association.\
        \ On the fourth of September, 1838, the Trenton Institute was formally organized.\
        \ It continued an active career until March 24th, 1*44, when it ceased operations.\
        \ The institute frequently met in the large saloon \u2014 or assemblage-room\
        \ \u2014 of the City Hall. Among its active members were George Woodruff,\

        \ where free lectures on arts and se-iences were held, was established in\

        \ M. Lewis were instrumental in its organization. In 1845, the Irving Institute,\

        the seventeenth of May, in the city of Newark, the New Jersey Historical Society,
        with becoming ceremonies, celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. The illustrious
        record of a semi-centen nial, during which time its large and priceless collection
        of books and mementos of the past have been secured, and its publications
        have been issued, commenced in the city of Trenton. The roll of honor, dated
        the twenty-seventh e.f February, 1845, and which was signed in the State Cajiitol,
        is as follows : Joseph P. Bradley, Newark ; George Clinton Bush, Trenton ;
        Rev. Dr. Jonathan Cogswell, New Brunswick; Rev. Ely F. Cooley, Trenton; Rt.
        Rev. George Doane, Burlington; Richard S. Field, Princeton ; Henry AV. Green,

        Charles C. Stratton, Swedesborough ; Dr. Jonathan J. Spencer, Moorestown ;
        William A. Whitehead, Newark. In the incejition of the society, it was designed
        that its meetings should be held in this city, and that its collections should
        be stored in the State Cajiitol. East Jersey, and particularly Newark, being
        more interested in the work of the organiza tion than were Trenton and AVest
        Jersey, the society soon became permanently located on the banks of the Passaic.
        Since then it has grown into a most influential institution. Athletic Organizations.
        Trenton in athletics formerly occupied a more prominent place than at present.
        A decade since the national game of base-ball, together with a cricket club
        largely composed of English pottery operatives, were phases of the athletic
        movement, To-day, however, these associations are mere memories. The college
        and j.rofessional games at Princeton, Philadelphia and New York, with varied
        attractions, have rendered attempts to make Trenton a center for athletic
        entertainments almost futile Even the "Trades Leagues" were a practical failure.
        The last noted event in this city was tin- University of Pennsylvania-Princeton
        foot-ball game, when the Red and Blue defeated tin- Orange and Black, on the
        Inter-State Fair grounds. This was in November, 1894. AVhether or not the
        efforts to make Trenton the meeting place between rival teams will succeed
        remains to be seem Tin- athletic amusements which have the strongest hold
        upon the city are cycling and canoe ing. The latter is especially prominent,
        owing to the character of the Delaware river, with its near by "Palls." rapids
        and smooth, wide intervening channel. The rapid-transit facilities to boat
        houses an- also worthy of particular mention, whilst the low-lying banks of
        the river afford facilities for the easy and cheap erection of clul. -houses.
        Canoe Clubs. Canoeing on the Delaware river owes its origin to the late William
        Al. Carter and Samuel G. Fur man, who first paddled their craft through Trenton
        Falls in 1*76. For a long time they followed this diversion, practically alone,
        and it was not until 1**4 that the Trenton Canoe Club came into existence.
        Its founders wen- William Al. Carter, Robert G. Lucas, Frederick F. C. AVoodward,
        Prank W. Sigler and John A. Gallavan, and from this first organization the
        history of the present canoeclubs may be traced. Within the next few years
        " unattached " canoeists were to be found upon the river, but the social aspects
        of the sport soon led to more effective organization. The many', 2]

        It is well worth a visit, but tourists who are not geologists are recommended
        to make a bargain as to the price of admission before entering. The fish market
        here is the great attraction, and well worth visiting between nine and twelve
        in the morning and about five or six in the evening, just as the fish leaves
        for London ; the long shed near the quay, where it is packed for the London
        market, presents quite a pretty scene. Fish is usually plentiful and good.
        Walks and drives round Brixham are numerous and very pretty, and there are
        many places of interest in the neighbourhood worth visiting. Vehicles of all
        sorts can be hired at a very reasonable rate at both hotels and other places
        ; they are comfortable and well turned out with good horses and drivers. The
        principal place of interest within a walk is Barry Head, which is approached
        through a picturesque ruined arch over a drawbridge ; inside, on the enclosed
        open space, are ruined cottages, restored partly for habitation, where once
        were fortifications. The sea view from its headland is magnificent. There
        are near the pretty towns of Kingswear, Dartmouth, Paignton, Torquay, and
        others, which can be reached by either rail or road. Good bass and other fishing
        is obtainable, and pleasure or fishing boats can be hired. The golf links
        at Churston are highly spoken of (see Torquay). The principal hotels are the
        Queen''s, the Bolton, the George, and the Globe. Lodgings are good and reasonable.
        The chief news agent and librarian is Mr. J. Cranford, postmaster, etc., Fore
        Street. The house agents are Messrs. Lovel, Bolton Street, and Mr. T. S. Brown,
        Fore Street. DARTMOUTH. Most picturesquely situated on the west side of the
        river Dart, this town is distant from London two hundred and six miles, and
        from Exeter and Plymouth about thirty miles (twenty-saven from Plymouth by
        road). The terminus of the Great Western Railway is at the village of Kingswear,
        on the opposite bank of the river Dart, which at that point is about half
        a mile broad ; but a steamer from Dartmouth meets every train except the one
        arriving at midnight, which is met by watermen. A very pleasant way of reaching
        Dartmouth during the summer season is by the sine steamers of the Clyde Shipping
        Co., leaving London every Thursday and Glasgow every Friday ; or by the British
        and Irish Company''s steamers to Plymouth, leaving Miller''s Wharf, London,
        on Wednesday and Sunday mornings, and occupying two days in the journey, thence
        by rail to Dartmouth, via Newton Abbot (about fifty miles), or to Totnes (about
        twenty-four miles), and thence by', 1]

        Outside it was an ordinary looking Japanese house of the humbler sort, built
        entirely of wood and only closed in with sliding shutters (shoji), except
        that it had a window out of which leaned the most venerable Japanese I ever
        saw, with a handsome, long, snowy white beard. I don''t suppose its counterpart
        exists among pure blooded Japanese. When we got inside, some time was wasted
        in the elabo rate bows between Mayeda San and the librarian, who looked about
        twelve years old, of course after that worthy had given me the most elaborate
        kowtow in his repertoire. A good deal more time was consumed in Mr. Mayeda''s

        to present a plain, unadorned portrait of the man, he has wisely allowed him
        to tell his own story in extracts from reports, and journals, and letters,
        some of which were written with the freedom of personal friendship, without
        any thought of publication. These memorials will be read with eagerness throughout
        the Church, and will, by the blessing of God, be an inspiration in missionary
        effort. They are commended, more especially, to the study of our rising ministry,
        with the earnest prayer that they may lead some to tread in Geo. McDougall''s
        footsteps, and win a like imperishable renown.'''' We would urge upon the

        \ and to the \"Hop Yard Well\" at Charlemont in Chap. xlix. Another well is,\
        \ according to Wednesbury tradition, a place of his toric import. This is\
        \ Grigg's Well, at the curve of Coles Lane. Hire, it is said, Charles II.\

        \ known as Lyndon, and where is situated \"Lyne Purl,\" a spring of excellent\
        \ soft water still flowing freely, but no doubt much con taminated now through\
        \ the populonsness of the neighhouihood. In olden days, when the spring purled\
        \ through an oprn country, its pure waters were without doubt a beneficent\
        \ boon to the sparse popu lation around it ; indeed, so beautifully benignant\
        \ was the \"Lyne Purl\" that it seems to have inspired more ihon one local\
        \ poet aster to sing its praises. One effusion will be found among the papers\
        \ of the late C. H. Bayley carefully preserved in the Public Library by the\
        \ zealous librarian, Mr D. Dickinson. [It may jot be out of place here to\
        \ acknowledge the unvarying courtesy and attention of this public official,\
        \ to whom the writer is much indebted. The rich stores of local information\
        \ collected in the Free Library by Mr Dickinson, much of it collated aud iudexeil\
        \ by him, will one day prove invaluable to some abler writer than the present.]\
        \ When the wells of the parish were examined some years ago at the instance\
        \ of the local authority, Lyne Purl was (with may private sources of water\
        \ snpply) condemned on chemical analysis ; and by order of the saiJ authorities\
        \ it was closed to the public. So strong, however, was popular prijudice in\
        \ favour of the Lyne water, that the attempted closing led almost to a riot\
        \ ; and at the present time, although a warning notice against the use of\
        \ the water is attached to the brickwork of the spring, it is to be feared\
        \ the people entirely disregard it. At the i overnment inquiry of 18S2 it\
        \ was stated that the South STAFFor.DsHir.E Water Works Co., w-ho supply this\
        \ ami the surrounding parishes, had been desired to transfer the water supply\
        \ of West Bromwich to the hands of the Commissioners in bulk, and the Commissioners\
        \ wouhl then undertake to supply the consumers within the parish area. There\
        \ were then thirty miles of water mains in the parish, supplying 4,700 houses,\
        \ or about half the population. Where the wells were pure, the people were\
        \ still permitted by the Sanitary Authority to use them. The Corporation have\
        \ not acquired any portion of the Water Works as yet, nor are they at present\
        \ like'y to do so ; but a brief review of the in eeplion and origin of this\
        \ great undertaking may here be useful, as so few public men seem acquainted\
        \ with that history \u2014 except, perhaps. Alderman Richard Williams, of\

        \ lodging houses, etc. But additional and more impoitaut powers are conferred\
        \ upon it. Fur example, all lounty or main roads passing through the borough\
        \ have now to be repaired and maintained by the Corpoiation, and Ihe building\
        \ and repairing of all bridges within the boundaries (ether than tail way\
        \ anil canal bridges) have also by this Act to be done ly the Corporation,\
        \ who have also to defray the cost and expenses of the police and provide\
        \ for the maintenance of pauper lunatics. 1 hese charges were formerly defrayed\
        \ in part from County funds or Govern ment sources, but from 1st April, 1889,\
        \ the payments from these sources were discontinued; and as a compen sation\
        \ the Corporation receive t eproceeds of the Local Taxation Licenses and a\
        \ proportion of the Probxte Duties. The Corporation have hitherto realised\
        \ a sur plus from the Local Taxation Grants after meeting the additional bin\
        \ dens thrown upon it, and about \xA33,000 per arnuni 'rom this source has\
        \ been applied in direct relief of rates, either the general district rate\
        \ or borough rate, or both, as circumstances have required. In all matters\
        \ except assizes, the borough is now free from county control and tl e Council\
        \ have trans ferred to them all the administrative functions of a county.\
        \ The borough is also likewise constituted a Quarter Sessions borough. The\
        \ Corporation, in conjunction with Ihe other county boroughs in Staffordshire,\
        \ have entered into an agreement with the county of Stafford for the re ception\
        \ of the borough pauper lunatics in the County Asylum at a fixed charge per\

        \ ployments degraded by servile hands. It is very easy for us to take too\
        \ low a view of the position of the servile classes in the ancient world.\
        \ In deed, it is natural that we should do so, for when we in the present\
        \ day speak of a slave, we think of the negro or the serf ; but such an analogy\
        \ leads us far from the truth. Among the Romans there was a large class of\
        \ literary slaves employed by the wealthy as secretaries, librarians, readers,\
        \ tutors, and so forth. From this class no doubt sprang the slave authors,\
        \ such as Terence, Caecilius, Phaedrus, and Epictetus. The class of ordi narii\
        \ were men, more or less educated, who occupied positions of trust, managing\
        \ the incomes and expendi ture of their masters like modern stewards. Besides\
        \ these there were, as before mentioned, professional slaves, physicians,\
        \ surgeons, architects, and artisans of all classes. In addition to knowledge\
        \ and skill some slaves possessed wealth. Legally all that the slave earned\
        \ belonged to his master ; but custom stronger than law permitted the slave\
        \ to retain his peculium. So it came to pass that there were frequently very\
        \ wealthy slaves.1 Bad, indefensibly bad as was ancient slavery, it was not\
        \ so harsh in at least one important respect as either serf dom or negro slavery.\
        \ Hope was by no means cut off. Aristotle taught that slaves should be always\
        \ encouraged by the hope of freedom.2 A stern law of caste reduced the medi\xE6\
        val serf almost to the condition of the Indian Sudra. 1 Becker, Gallus, p.\

        \ Nijenburg) Envoy Extraordinary from the United Provinces to the Court of\
        \ Naples, and John Heyman, Professor of the Oriental languages in the University\
        \ of Leyden, are the names which appear on the title page of two volumes of\
        \ \"Travels through part of Europe, Asia Minor, the Islands of the Archipelago,\
        \ Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Mount Sinai &c.\" translated from the Low Dutch,\
        \ and printed at London, 1759. Perhaps the Dutch original existed only in\
        \ manuscript, and the work appears to be translated from notes not finally\
        \ arranged or revised by the writer, who was probably Heyman only. In the\
        \ Preface it is observed that the authors \"visited those Countries twice;\
        \ in the first tour they spent nine years, and in the second four.\" On page\
        \ 258 of the first volume the writer states that he \"had been sent by the\
        \ States General to acquire a true knowledge of the Eastern Nations, and understand\
        \ their several languages\"; and his observations may have been presented\
        \ to his government in the form of a Report. They came to Cyprus from Smyrna\
        \ and Rhodes, and left it for Jaffa and Jerusalem. But the book is singularly\
        \ wanting in dates. At Florence (vol.1.43) about 1693, they saw the famous\
        \ librarian Antonio Magliabecchi (n. 1633, ob. 1714.) \"He was at that time\
        \ about sixty years of age.\" They mention (1.256) the treaty of the Pruth\
        \ (July 21, 1711,) but the date of a firman (1.232) granted at Constantinople\
        \ I Muharram, A.H. 1033 (A.D. 1623) should probably be read A.H. (1133 A.D.\
        \ 1720). Generally we may gather that their visit to Cyprus fell within the\
        \ first quarter of the eighteenth century. We transcribe from volume II Chap.\
        \ XVIII. pp. 281-295. Voyage to the island of Cyprus ; with some account of\
        \ that island. We left Rhodes with a fair wind, which soon brought us in sight\
        \ of a rocky island, called Castro Rosso, situated near the continent, and\
        \ inhabited by Greeks and Turks. Soon after we found ourselves opposite to\
        \ the gulph of Satalia; and on the sixth day after our departure from Rhodes\
        \ we made the islanel of Cyprus, and sailed near cape Sampifani, and Fonte\
        \ Amoroso, anciently called Acamas. Not far to the Eastward lies the city\
        \ of Arsinoe, now known by the name of Lefcari, and famous for the cavern\
        \ of Jupiter. About noon we had sight of Basse, one of the principal towns\
        \ in the island of Cyprus, and not far from the site of the ancient Paphos.\
        \ But at night we stood off to sea for fear of running too near Cape de Gat,\
        \ where a shoal stretches some leagues into the sea. The next morning we came\
        \ to an anchor in the bay of Salina, which is capacious enough to contain\
        \ a whole fleet, and situated between two promontories, of which that on the\
        \ west is called Chiti, and that on the east Pila. The ships lie at anchor\
        \ about a league from the shore, that in case of a storm, especially at south,\
        \ they may be in no danger of being stranded. A boat belonging to the island\
        \ landed us at Salina, a small village, called by the Turks Dousla, and fortified\
        \ with a kind of ravelin, planted with eight pieces of cannon for defend ing\
        \ the road against the corsairs. Hence we travelled to Lernica, the place\
        \ where most of the Franks reside. The island of Cyprus was by the Greeks\

        \ everybody with his airy bravado and his graceful insolence, winning the\
        \ hearts of the women and borrowing the money of the men, until there remained\
        \ for him no longer a theatre for the practice of his arts and the display\
        \ of his attractions. In biographical writings he is mentioned as the Don\
        \ Juan of his time ; but the Don Juan of the dramatic or the lyric stage was\
        \ a modest and retiring person in comparison with the Venetian adventurer.\
        \ He went to visit Vol taire at Ferney, and Frederick the Great at Sans Souei\

        \ On his way Casanova passed through the very hall of the council, and arriving\
        \ upon the floor above it was confined in a small cell communicating with\
        \ a great garret, where, with other prisoners, he was allowed at stated times\
        \ to walk. It was that part of the prison which was known by the descriptive\
        \ and me morable title of \" Under the Leads.\" It need hardly be said that\
        \ with so fertile a mind and irrepressible a spirit as he possessed, Casanova\
        \ entertained, from the very moment of his incarceration, the idea of escape.\
        \ For tune favoured him at the start. In wandering about the old garret he\
        \ found an iron bolt, of the thickness of an ordinary walking-cane, and twenty\
        \ inches in length, which he sharpened upon a piece of loose marble from the\
        \ walls, into a sort of pike. With this he undertook to cut his way through\
        \ the floor, which was of three thicknesses, into the apartment below. Perhaps\
        \ the most respectable position he ever occupied, until the lettered close\
        \ of his remarkable career, was as a member of the orchestra, in 1745, of\
        \ the theatre of San Samuele in Venice. Here he played for some time, in one\
        \ of his intervals of impecuniosity, until he could refit his wardrobe and\
        \ organize his plans for another campaign. Such scamps rarely come to a good\
        \ end, and yet the last twelve years of Casanova's life were spent in creditable\
        \ \u2014 nay, honourable employment, as the librarian of Count Waldstein of\
        \ Bohemia, in whose well -stored alcoves he wrote the History of Poland, and\
        \ prepared a translation of the Iliad. It was a work of great difficulty.\
        \ Fearing that the hole to be made under his bed would be discovered by the\
        \ servants when they came to sweep his cell, he feigned a cough, and by a\
        \ cut upon the finger stained his handkerchief with blood to corroborate his\

        \ chus of Samos, reputed to have been the greatest critic of ancient times.\
        \ The study of the text of Homer Avas the chief labour of Zenodotus, Aris\
        \ tophanes, and Aristarchus, and it was Aristar chus who mainly fixed the\
        \ form in which the Iliad and Odyssey remain to this day. . . . The vast collections\

        \ in philosophy, in criti cism, in science, even in poetry. Strange to say,\
        \ they neglected not only oratory, for which there was no scope, but history,\
        \ and this we may attri bute to the fact that history before Alexander had\
        \ no charms for Hellenism. Mythical lore, on the other hand, strange uses\
        \ and curious words, were departments of research dear to them. In science\
        \ they did great things, so did they in geography. . '. But were they origiual\
        \ in nothing? Did they add nothing of their OAvn to the splendid record of\
        \ Greek literature? In the next gener ation came the art of criticism, which\
        \ Aristar chus developed into a real science, and of that we may speak in\
        \ its place; but even in this generation we may claim for them the credit\
        \ of three original, or nearly original, developments in literature \u2014\
        \ the pastoral idyll, as we have it in Theocritus; the elegy, as Ave have\
        \ it in the Roman imitators of Pliiletas and Callimachus; and the romance,\
        \ or love story, the parent of our modern novels. All these had early prototypes\
        \ in the folk songs of Sicily, in the love songs of Mimnermus and of Antimachus,\
        \ in the tales of Miletus, but still the revival Avas fairly to be called\
        \ original. Of these the pastoral idyll was far the most remarkable, and laid\
        \ hold upon the Avorld for ever.\"\u2014 J. P. Mahaffy, The Story of Alexander's\
        \ Empire, ch. 13-14. \u2014 \" There were two Libraries of Alexandria under\
        \ the Ptolemies, the larger one in the quarter called the Bruchium, ancl the\
        \ smaller one, named 'the daughter,' in the Serapeum, Avhich Avas situated\
        \ in the quarter called Rhacotis. The former Avas totally destroyed in the\
        \ conflagration of the Bruchium during C\xE6sar's Alexandrian War [see below:\
        \ B. C. 48-47] ; but the latter, which was of great value,_remained uninjured\
        \ (see Matter, Histoire de VEcole a\" Alexandrie, vol. 1, p. 133 seq., 237\
        \ seq.) It is not stated by any ancient writer where the collection of Pergamus\
        \ [see Perga- mtxm] was placed, which Antony gave to Cleo- patra (Plutarch,\
        \ Anton., c. 58); but it is most probable that it was deposited in the Bruchium,\
        \ as that quarter of the city Avas now without a library, and the queen was\
        \ anxious to repair the ravages occasioned by the civil war. If this supposition\
        \ is correct, two Alexandrian libraries continued to exist after the time\
        \ of C\xE6sar, and this is rendered still more probable by the fact that during\
        \ the first three centuries of the Chris- tian era the Bruchium was still\
        \ the literary quarter of Alexandria. But a great change took place in the\
        \ time of Aurelian. This Emperor, in suppressing the revolt of Firmus in Egypt,\
        \ A. D. 273 [see below: A. D. 273] is said to have destroyed the Bruchium\
        \ ; and though this state- ment is hardly to be taken literally, the Bruchium\
        \ ceased from this time to be included Avithin the walls of Alexandria, and\
        \ was regarded only as a suburb of the city. Whether the great library in\
        \ the Bruchium with the museum and its other to have been seven millions \u2014\
        \ of Egypt, they made all the profits of this enormous carrying trade We gain\
        \ a good idea of what the splen dours of the capital were by the very full\
        \ account preserved to us bv Athen\xE6us of the great feast which inaugurated\
        \ the reign of Philadelphus All this seems idle pomp, and the doing ot an\
        \ idle Sybarite. Philadelphus Avas anything but that It Avas he who opened\
        \ up the Egyp tian trade with Italy, aud made Puteoli the great port for ships\
        \ from Alexandria, A\\hich it remained for centuries. It Avas he who explored\
        \ Ethiopia and the southern parts of Africa, and brought back not only the\
        \ curious fauna to his zoological gardens, but the first knowledge of the\
        \ Troglo dytes for men of science. The cultivation of science and of letters\
        \ too Avas so remarkably one of his pursuits that the progress of the Alexan\
        \ dria of his day forms an epoch in the world's history, and Ave must separate\
        \ his University and its professors from this summary, aud devote to them\
        \ a separate section. . . . The history of the organization of the University\
        \ and its staff is covered with almost impenetrable mist. For the Museum and\
        \ Library Avere in the strictest sense what Ave should now call an University,\
        \ and one, too, of the Oxford type, Avhere learned meu Avere invited to take\
        \ Fellowships, and spend their learned leisure close to observatories in science,\
        \ and a great library of books. Like the medi\xE6val universities, this endowment\
        \ of research naturally turned into an engine for teaching, as all Avho desired\
        \ knowledge flocked to such a centre, and persuaded the Fellow to become a\
        \ Tutor. The model came from Athens. There the schools, beginning with the\
        \ Academy of Plato, had a fixed property \u2014 a home with its surrounding\
        \ garden, and in order to make this foundation sure, it was made a shrine\
        \ Avhere the Muses Avere Avorshipped, and where the head of the school, or\
        \ a priest appointed, performed stated sacrifices. This, then, being held\
        \ in trust by the successors of the donor, avIio bequeathed ii, to them, Avas\
        \ a property which it would have been sacrilegious to invade, and so the title\
        \ Museum arose for a school of learning. Demetrius the Phalerean, the friend\
        \ and protector of Theophrastus, brought this idea with him to Alexandria,\
        \ Avhen his name- sake drove him into exile [see Greece: B. C. 307-197] and\
        \ it Avas no doubt his advice to the first Ptolemy which originated the great\
        \ foun- dation, though Philadeiphus, who again exiled Demetrius, gets the\
        \ credit of it. The pupil of Aristotle moreover impressed on the king the\
        \ necessity of storing up in one central repository all that the Avorld knew\
        \ or could produce, in order to ascertain the laws of things from a pro- per\
        \ analysis of detail. Hence was founded not only the great library, which\
        \ iu those days had a thousand times the value a great library has now, but\
        \ also observatories, zoological gardens, col- lections of exotic plants,\
        \ and of other new and strange things brought by exploring expeditions from\
        \ the furthest regions of Arabia and Africa. This library and museum proved\
        \ indeed a home for the Muses, and about it a most brilliant group of students\
        \ in literature aud science was formed. The successive librarians were Zenodotus,\
        \ the grammarian or critic; Callimachus, to whose poems Ave shall presently\
        \ return; Eratosthenes, the astronomer, who originated the process by which\
        \ the size of the earth is determined to-day ; Appollonius the Rhodian, disciple\

        \ imperial constitutions, which sometimes extended, sometimes confirmed their\
        \ privileges. . . . After the Empire was divided among many masters, each\
        \ of them concerned himself rather more about the prosperity of his states\
        \ and the public establishments which were in them. Thence arose a momentary\
        \ amelioration, of which the schools felt the effects, particularly those\
        \ of Gaul, under the administration of Constantius Clorus, of Julian, and\
        \ of Gratian. By the side of the schools were, in general, placed other analogous\
        \ establishments. Thus, at Treves there was a grand library of the imperial\
        \ palace, con cerning which no special information has reached us, but of\
        \ which we may judge by the details which have reached us concerning that\
        \ of Con stantinople. This last had a librarian and seven scribes constantly\
        \ occupied \u2014 four for Greek, and three for Latin. They copied both ancient\
        \ and new works. It is probable that the same institu tion existed at Treves,\
        \ and in the great towns of Gaul. Civil society, then, was provided with means\
        \ of instruction and intellectual develop ment. It was not the same with religious\
        \ so ciety. It had at this epoch no institution especi ally devoted to teaching\
        \ ; it did not receive from the state any aid to this particular aim. Chris\
        \ tians, as well as others, could frequent the public schools; but most of\
        \ the professors were still pagans. ... It was for a long time in the in ferior\
        \ classes, among the people, that Chris tianity was propagated, especially\
        \ in the Gauls, and it was the superior classes which followed the great schools.\
        \ Moreover, it was hardly until the commencement of the fourth century that\
        \ the Christians appeared there, and then but few in number. No other source\
        \ of study was open to them. The establishments which, a little afterwards,\
        \ became, in the Christian church, the refuge and sanctuary of instruction,\
        \ the monas teries, were hardly commenced in tlie Gauls. It was only after\
        \ the year 360 that the two first were founded by St. Martin \u2014 one at\
        \ Liguge, near Poitiers, the other at Marmoutiers, near Tours ; and they were\
        \ devoted rather to religious contemplation than to teaching. Any great school,\
        \ any special institution devoted to the service and to the progress of intellect,\
        \ was at that time, therefore, wanting to the Christians. . . . All things\
        \ in the fifth century, attest the decay of the civil schools. The contemporaneous\
        \ writers, Sidonius Apollinaris and Mamertius Claudianus, for example, deplore\
        \ it in every page, saying 'that the young men no longer studied, that professors\
        \ were without pupils, that science languished and was being lost. ... It\
        \ was es pecially the young men of the superior classes who frequented the\
        \ schools; but these classes . . . were in rapid dissolution. The schools\
        \ fell with them ; the institutions still existed, but they were void \u2014\
        \ the soul had quitted the body. The intellectual aspect of Christian society\
        \ was very different. . . . Institutions began to rise, and to be regulated\
        \ among the Christians of Gaul. The foundation of the greater portion of the\
        \ large monasteries of the southern provinces belongs to the first half of\
        \ the fifth century. . . . The monasteries of the south of Gaul were philosoph\
        \ ical schools of Christianity; it was there that intellectual men meditated,\
        \ discussed, taught; it was from thence that new ideas, daring thoughts, heresies,\
        \ were sent forth. . . . Towards the end of the sixth century, everything\
        \ is changed: Medi\xE6val. The Chaos of Barbaric Conquest. \u2014 \"The utter\
        \ confusion subsequent upon the downfall of the Roman Empire and the irruption\
        \ of the Germanic races was causing, by the mere brute force of circumstance,\
        \ a gradual extinction of scholarship too powerful to be arrested. The teaching\
        \ of grammar for ecclesiastical purposes was insufficient to check the influence\
        \ of many causes leading to this overthrow of learning. It was impossible\
        \ to communicate more than a mere tincture of knowledge to students sepa rated\
        \ from the classical tradition, for whom the antecedent history of Rome was\
        \ a dead letter. The meaning of Latin words derived from the Greek was lost.\
        \ . . . Theological notions, gro tesque and childish beyond description, iiound\
        \ their way into etymology and grammar. The three persons of the Trinity were\
        \ discovered in the verb, and mystic numbers in the parts of speech. Thus\
        \ analytical studies like that of lan guage came to be regarded as an open\
        \ field for the exercise of the mythologising fancy ; and ety mology was reduced\
        \ to a system of ingenious punning. . . . Virgil, the only classic who re\
        \ tained distinct and living personality, passed from poet to philosopher,\
        \ from philosopher to Sibyl, from Sibyl to magician, by successive stages\
        \ of transmutation, as the truth about him grew more dim and the faculty to\
        \ apprehend him weakened. Forming the staple of education in the schools of\
        \ the grammarians, and meta morphosed by the vulgar consciousness into a wizard,\
        \ he waited on the extreme verge of the dark ages to take Dante by the hand,\
        \ and lead him, as the type of human reason, through the realms of Hell and\
        \ Purgatory.\" \u2014 J. A. Symonds, Renaissance in Italy : the Revival of\
        \ Learning, ch.2. Gaul: 4th-5th Centuries. \u2014 -\"If institutions could\
        \ do all, if laws supplied and the means fur nished to society could do everything,\
        \ the in tellectual state of Gaulish civil society at this epoch [4th-5th\
        \ centuries] would have been far superior to that of the religious society.\
        \ The first, in fact, alone possessed all the institutions proper to second\
        \ the development of mind, the progress and empire of ideas. Roman Gaul was\
        \ covered with large schools. The principal were those of Treves, Bordeaux,\

        \ &c. Some were very ancient ; those of Marseilles and of Autun, for example,\

        that would be representative in character rather than exhaustive. The restric
        tions of space imposed by the limits of such a series as this have necessitated
        the omission of many pieces that readers might expect to see included. As
        far as possible, however, the most typical satires of the successive eras
        have been selected, so as to throw into relief the special literary characteristics
        of each, and to manifest the trend of satiric develop ment during the centuries
        elapsing between Lang land and Lowell. Acknowledgment is due, and is gratefully
        ren dered, to Mrs. C. S. Calverley for permission to print the verses which
        close this book; and to Messrs. Macmillan & Co. for permission to print A.
        H. Clough''s " Spectator ab Extra ". To Professor C. H. Herford my warmest
        thanks are due for his careful revision of the Introduction, and for many
        valuable hints which have been adopted in the course of the work; also to
        Mr. W. Keith Leask, M.A.(Oxon.), and the librarians of the Edinburgh University

  - - ["INTRODUCTION. XXXVII (notably for that of Jesus in the Temple) we can trace\
        \ the influence of the Yorkshire cycles, and the play on the sacrifice of\
        \ Isaac was borrowed either from, or from the same original as, the Brome\
        \ play, printed by Miss Toulmin Smith. But if it be true, as Professor Ten\
        \ Brink suggests, that the Chester cycle is both less important and less original\
        \ than those of York and Woodkirk, and that its best, both of pathos and humour\
        \ appears to be borrowed, it must be allowed on the other hand that its author\
        \ was possessed of an unusual share of good taste. There is less in the Chester\
        \ plays to jar on modem feelings than in any other of the cycles. The humour\
        \ is kept more within bounds, the religious tone is far higher, and though\
        \ the plays are not spoilt by any obtrusive didacticism such as we find in\
        \ the Coventry cycle, the speeches of the Expositor at the end of each play\
        \ show that a real effort was made to serve the religious object to which\
        \ all Miracle plays were ostensibly directed. On a comparison of the contents\
        \ of this cycle with that of York we note that fresh subjects are intro duced\
        \ in the histories of Lot and of Balaam, in the play on Ezekiel, which contains\
        \ prophecies of the end of the world and the Fifteen Signs of Doom, and in\
        \ the very curious em bodiment of the medieval legends on the coming of Antichrist.\
        \ On the other hand, there is no play of the Exodus, the plays on the history\
        \ of the Blessed Virgin are represented only by a Salutation and the Nativity\
        \ of Christ (in the course of which the Emperor Octavian is introduced giving\
        \ his orders for all the world to be taxed), and there is no play on the Assumption.\
        \ Like those of York, the Chester plays were enacted by the members of the\
        \ Trade- Gilds, not, however, on the feast of Corpus Christi, but at Whitsuntide.\
        \ The fourth cycle of plays which we have to consider is con tained in a manuscript,\
        \ the greater part of which was written in the year 1468, and which now belongs\
        \ to the Cottonian Collec tion in the British Museum. On the fly-leaf of this\
        \ manuscript, which was probably purchased by Sir Robert Cotton about 1630,\

        in his pocket, and trenchant and freely-spoken cricket criticism on his lips.

        \ inland, quite out of the longest range of any gun that went to sea in those\
        \ days. While Stuart's men are advancing through the myrtle- scrub, it may\
        \ be worth while to call attention to a point which is apt to be over looked.\
        \ The long subsequent series of battles between British and French troops\
        \ which cul minated at Waterloo, proved to the world that our soldiers could,\
        \ as a rule, hold their own against Napoleon's veterans. But in 1806 this\
        \ was far from being the case. It was, indeed, five y*ears since an English\
        \ and a French army had met in the Alexandrian campaign ; and though on that\
        \ occasion our arms had been suc cessful, their success was hardly enough\
        \ to cancel the impression produced by the disasters which mismanagement had\
        \ brought upon our forces in Plolland and on the northern frontier of France\
        \ during the early part of the war. The enormous \" prestige \" which the\
        \ collapse of the great military monarchies of Europe had conferred on the\
        \ French armies must also be taken into consideration. Sir Sidney Smith, writing\
        \ about this time, had spoken of the idea \u2014 which, though he calls it\
        \ mistaken, he admits was much too prevalent \u2014 \" that the progress of\
        \ the French armies is irresistible.\" It will be seen, then, that Stuart's\
        \ little force had no reason to think lightly of the task that lay before\
        \ it. On reaching the mouth of the Sant' Ippolito the troops halted for a\
        \ while on the long spit of land lying between the river and the shore. At\
        \ this point they were in full view of the opposing army, and they were at\
        \ once surprised and delighted, one may suppose, to see that it was moving.\
        \ It is not easy to conjecture Reynier's motive in having thus thrown away\
        \ the im mense advantage that his initial position had given him. He may have\
        \ feared that Stuart would turn his flank, and get him between the English\
        \ army and the ships. The French writer above quoted thinks that the presence\
        \ of Lebrun, the Imperial Commissioner, had a good deal to do with Reynier's\
        \ decision to fight. \" Reynier,\" he say*s, \" found himself in presence\
        \ of an overlooker, with directions to report. If he had won the battle, it\
        \ would have been the emperor's genius, the emperor's idea, the emperor's\
        \ orders. As he lost it, it is all our fault.\" Another French w-riter, writing\
        \ some years later, mentions a belief current at the time that Rey-nier was\
        \ decided by personal motives. He and Stuart had been opposed to each other\
        \ during the Egyptian campaign in 1801, and Reynier had got the worst of it.\
        \ Possibly all these reasons, combined with a sort of chivalrous feeling that\
        \ so pointed a challenge ought not to be declined, may have urged him to take\
        \ what proved so disastrous a step. By half-past eight the French had descended\
        \ into the plain, and formed line on their right ; and it was then seen that\
        \ the expected rein forcements had come up, and that Rey-nier had little short\
        \ of 8,000 men at his disposal. His force was as follows : \u2014 (It must\
        \ be remembered that a French regiment contains many more men than one of\
        \ ours, and in those days the difference was even greater.) On the right was\
        \ the 23rd Regiment, then the 42nd, next to them a brigade of Poles and Swiss,\
        \ while the left was held by* one of the crack regiments of the French service\
        \ \u2014 the ist Leger. The cavalry, 300 in number, was at the beginning of\
        \ the action posted on the left wing. Thousands of Calabrian peasantry thronged\
        \ the surrounding hills, and anxiously awaited the result of the struggle.\
        \ Some skirmishing seems to have taken place before the main armies were fully\
        \ engaged, between the light company of the 20th Regiment \u2014 which, as\
        \ has been explained, formed with other light companies a part of Kempt's\
        \ brigade on our right\u2014 and some of the French troops, who were still\
        \ fording the Amato when our men Crossing the stream, which is everywhere\
        \ fordable, the English force deployed, and pro ceeded across the plain in\
        \ echelon, the right wing in advance. The formation was as fol lows : \u2014\
        \ On the right was the light brigade, made up, as has been said, of the light\
        \ com panies of the various regiments, with the Corsican Rangers, under Colonel\
        \ Kempt. To the left of them, and in rear of all the other brigades, came\
        \ the 3rd, commanded by Colonel Oswald, and consisting of the 58th Regiment,\
        \ and the foreign auxiliaries under Sir Louis de Watteville. In the centre,\
        \ at the regular echelon distance to the left rear of the light brigade, was\
        \ the 2nd brigade, comprising the 81st and 78th, under Brigadier-General Acland\
        \ ; while the left wing \u2014 that is, the ist brigade \u2014 under Brigadier-General\

        and house rent are cheap. There is not much beach, as the town is principally
        built round the bay on the cliffs, but gentlemen can get good bathing. Of
        churches there are three : Upper and Lower Brixham and St. Peter''s ; this
        last is in connection with the mission to seamen, for whom there is a cheap
        home. It was at Brixham that William Prince of Orange (afterwards King William
        III.) landed on November 5th, 1688; a fine statue of him now marks the spot,
        and the identical stone on which he first set his foot on landing is preserved,
        placed in a neat obelisk. A stalactite and bone cavern, discovered here in
        1858, was leased for one year by the Royal Geological Society, and thoroughly
        explored by that learned body. The cavern exceeds 600ft., and the interior
        shows very curious formations of stalactites, etc. It is well worth a visit,
        but tourists who are not geologists are recommended to make a bargain as to
        the price of admission before entering. The fish market here is the great
        attraction, and well worth visiting between nine and twelve in the morning
        and about five or six in the evening, just as the fish leaves for London ;
        the long shed near the quay, where it is packed for the London market, presents
        quite a pretty scene. Fish is usually plentiful and good. Walks and drives
        round Brixham are numerous and very pretty, and there are many places of interest
        in the neighbourhood worth visiting. Vehicles of all sorts can be hired at
        a very reasonable rate at both hotels and other places ; they are comfortable
        and well turned out with good horses and drivers. The principal place of interest
        within a walk is Berry Head, which is approached through a picturesque ruined
        arch over a drawbridge ; inside, on the enclosed open space, are ruined cottages,
        restored partly for habitation, where once were fortifications. The sea view
        from its headland is magnificent. There are near the pretty towns of Kingswear,
        Dartmouth, Paignton, Torquay, and others, which can be reached by either rail
        or road. Good bass and other fishing is obtainable, and pleasure or fishing
        boats can be hired. The golf links at Churston are highly spoken of (see Torquay).
        The principal hotels are the Queen''s, the Bolton, the George, and the Globe.
        Lodgings are good and reasonable. The chief news agent and librarian is Mr.
        J. Cranford, postmaster, etc., Fore Street. The house agents are Messrs. Lovel,
        Bolton Street, and Mr. T. S. Brown, Fore Street. DARTMOUTH. Most picturesquely
        situated on the west side of the river Dart, this town is distant from London
        two hundred and six miles, and from Exeter and Plymouth about thirty miles
        (twenty-seven from Plymouth by road). The terminus of the Great Western Railway
        is at the village of Kingswear, on the opposite bank of the river', 1]

        \ work Harriet Beecher Stowe has wrought. Thanks for the Fugitive Slave Law.\
        \ Better for slavery that that law had never been enacted, for it gave occasion\
        \ for Uncle Tom's Cabin. ' . . . Macaulay wrote, thanking her for the volume,\
        \ assuring her of his high respect for the talents and for the benevolence\
        \ of the writer. Four years later, the same illustrious author, essayist,\
        \ and historian wrote to Mrs. Stowe: 'I have just returned from Italy, where\
        \ your fame seems to throw that of all other writers into the shade. There\
        \ is no place where Uncle Tom, transformed into II Zio Tom, is not to be found.\
        \ ' From Lord Carlisle she received a long and earnest epistle, in which he\
        \ says he felt that slavery was by far the ' top- ping ' question of the world\
        \ and age, and that he returned his ' deep and solemn thanks to Al- mighty\
        \ God, who has led and enabled you to write such a book. ' The Rev. Charles\
        \ Kingsley, in the midst of illness and anxiety, sent his thanks, saying :\
        \ ' Your book will do more to take away the reproach from your great and growing\
        \ nation than many platform agitations and speechi- fyings.' Said Lord Palmerston,\
        \ ' I have not read a novel for thirty years ; but I have read that book three\
        \ times, not only for the story, but for the statesmanship of it.' Lord Cockburn\
        \ de- clared : ' She has done more for humanity than was ever before accomplished\
        \ by any single book of fiction.' Within a year Uncle Tom's Cabin was scattered\
        \ all over the world. Translations were made into all the principal languages,\
        \ and into several obscure dialects, in number variously estimated from twenty\
        \ to forty. The librarian of the British Museum, with an interest and enter-\
        \ prise which might well put our own countrymen to blush, has made a collection\
        \ which is unique and very remarkable in the history of books. American visitors\
        \ may see there thirty-five edi- tions (Uncle Tom's Cabin) of the original\
        \ Eng- lish, and the complete text, and eight of abridg ments and adaptations.\

        \ \u2014 The doctrine of \"Squatter Sovereignty.\" \u2014 \"The slavery agitation\
        \ apparently had died away both in congress and throughout the country. This\
        \ calm, however, was doomed to a sudden inter ruption. The prospect of . .\
        \ . beneficent legis lation was destroyed by the introduction of a measure\
        \ which at once supplanted all other sub jects in congress and in the political\
        \ interests of the people. This was the novel and astounding proposal of Mr.\
        \ Douglas [Senator Stephen A. Douglas, of Illinois], in relation to the Kansas\
        \ and Nebraska territories. . . . The measure . . . alluded to . . . was a\
        \ provision in the bill for the organization of a territory in Nebraska, declaring\
        \ that the states which might at any future time be formed in the new territory\
        \ should leave the question of slavery to be de cided by the inhabitants thereof\
        \ on the adoption of their constitution, \u2014 [this being in accordance\
        \ with the doctrine which its advocates styled 'Popular Sovereignty,' but\
        \ which took the com moner name of ' Squatter Sovereignty ' from its opponents].\
        \ This provision was, as explained by the bill itself, the application of\
        \ the compro mise policy of 1850 to Nebraska, and, as was evident, virtually\
        \ repealed the Missouri Com promise of 1820, which guarantied that slavery\
        \ should be forever excluded from the territory in question. But, in order\
        \ to bring the supporters of the bill and its opponents to a more decided\
        \ test, an amendment was moved expressly an nulling that portion of the Missouri\
        \ Compromise which related to the subject. Mr. Douglas, after some deliberation,\
        \ accepted the amendment, and modified his plan so far as to introduce a new\
        \ bill for the organization of Nebraska and Kansas within the same limits,\
        \ instead of the territory of Nebraska alone, according to the original programme.\
        \ The administration lost no time in adopting this policy as their own. It\
        \ was at first proposed to hasten the passage of the bill through both houses\
        \ so rapidly as to prevent any remonstrance on the part of the people. But\
        \ the opponents of the measure, in cluding Mr. Seward, Mr. Chase, Mr. Sumner,\
        \ Mr. Truman Smith, Mr. Wade, Mr. Everett, Mr. Bell, Mr. Houston, and Mr.\
        \ Fessenden, com bined against it such an earnest and effective resistance\
        \ that the attention of the country was aroused, and an indignant protest\
        \ called forth from the people of the free states. The bill, however, passed\

        ; the climate is as good as, if not better than Torquay, for those suffering
        with delicate chests or in consumption, and anyone not caring for the expense
        and fashion of that town would revel in the cosy quietness of Brixham, which
        is certainly the most quaint and curiously situated town in South Devon. The
        season is mostly from October to April, but the place is a desirable residence
        at any time of the year. Brixham is divided into two parts, Higher and Lower.
        The latter is the principal part, and has several streets with fairly good
        shops, most of which are in Fore Street. Provisions and house rent are cheap.
        There is not much beach, as the town is principally built round the bay on
        the cliffs, but gentlemen can get good bathing. Of churches there are three
        : Upper and Lower Brixham and St. Peter''s ; this last is in connection with
        the mission to seamen, for whom there is a cheap home. It was at Brixham that
        William Prince of Orange (afterwards King William III.) landed on November
        5th, 1688; a fine statue of him now marks the spot, and the identical stone
        on which he first set his foot on landing is preserved, placed in a neat obelisk.
        A stalactite and bone cavern, discovered here in 1858, was leased for one
        year by the Royal Geological Society, and thoroughly explored by that learned
        body. The cavern exceeds 600ft. , and the interior shows very curious formations
        of stalactites, etc. It is well worth a visit, but tourists who are not geologists
        are recommended to make a bargain as to the price of admission before entering.
        The fish market here is the great attraction, and well worth visiting between
        nine and twelve in the morning and about five or six in the evening, just
        as the fish leaves for London ; the long shed near the quay, where it is packed
        for the London market, presents quite a pretty scene. Fish is usually plentiful
        and good. Walks and drives round Brixham are numerous and very pretty, and
        there are many places of interest in the neighbourhood worth visiting. Vehicles
        of all sorts can be hired at a very reasonable rate at both hotels and other
        places ; they are comfortable and well turned out with good horses and drivers.
        The principal place of interest within a walk is Berry Head, which is approached
        through a picturesque ruined arch over a drawbridge ; inside, on the enclosed
        open space, are ruined cottages, restored partly for habitation, where once
        were fortifications. The sea view from its headland is magnificent. There
        are near the pretty towns of Kingswear, Dartmouth, Paignton, Torquay, and
        others, which can be reached by either rail or road. Good bass and other fishing
        is obtainable, and pleasure or fishing boats can be hired. The golf links
        at Churston are highly spoken of (see Torquay). The principal hotels are the
        Queen''s, the Bolton, the George, and the Globe. Lodgings are good and reasonable.

        the paper takes the trouble to allay the fears of its readers by explaining
        to them that the hydrogen gas with wMch tlje opera will be provided is not
        set alight at the Abattoir Montmartre, where it is generated, and consequently
        does not travel aflame tMough the under ground pipes. The paper has sent its
        reporters to the locksmith (?), where the chandelier is being made, and that
        individual has given them every assurance to the contrary. There will not
        be the slightest danger to the audience. I am not apt to extol the intelligence
        of one nation over another, but I doubt whether a greater instance of downright
        lack of intelligence could have been found, even at that time, in the smallest
        capital of Europe, and even in connection with a scientific invention. As
        for strength of will, the Parisian has absolutely none; he is swayed Mther
        and tMther, much like a straw in a gust of wind, by this or that mob orator,
        pro vided the latter has a sufficiently large stock of high sounding phrases
        at his command : nay, one such pMase will generally produce the effect; nor
        does it matter how often that phrase has done duty before. No capital in the
        world has a more magnificent col lection of documents and works relating to
        its own Mstory than Paris. When the Commune burned the H6tel-de-Ville, its
        library was reduced to four or five volumes. M. Jules Cousin, the librarian,
        but for Ms generosity, would have found Mmself in the position of Casanova

        \ a degree less, but not more \u2014 to use impure water for cleansing purposes\

        \ inasmuch as in normal days the quantity of water, potable and otherwise,\

        \ The Senate Chamber was modelled after the ancient Greek theatre, and was\
        \ beautiful and commodious ; and the Hall of the House of Representatives\
        \ was an imposing specimen of Grecian archi tecture, much different from the\
        \ low, narrow apartment face tiously called \" the oven \" which the House\
        \ had occupied for some time. Mr. Jefferson was alwaj's ready to give his\

        \ It was in 1801 that the Library of Congress, which has grown to be one of\
        \ the five great libraries of the world, was estab lished. The library came\
        \ into existence mainly through the efforts of John Randolph, of Roanoke,\
        \ the eccentric Virginia statesman. It was placed in charge of a joint committee\
        \ of Congress, and $5000 was expended for books needed by the congressmen\
        \ for reference. Suitable rooms in the Capitol were provided for the library,\
        \ and an annual appropriation of $1000 was made for the purchase of books.\

        discharging the duties of one or more of these parochial cures, and whilst
        still for a short time Vicar of South Weald, Coningsburgh appears, to have
        been much engaged in important work at Cambridge. This connexion with the
        University he maintained for many years, in fact, almost to the end of his
        life. In his history of Corpus Christi College, Dr. Masters makes more than
        one reference to Coningsburgh. He speaks of him as " President of the University,"
        and subsequently, about the year 1471, still more distinctly as " Vice-Chancellor."
        I am told by the Librarian of Corpus that there are two instruments in the
        College relating to Coningsburgh, one, in 1472, sealed with the seal of his
        office as Vice Chancellor, the other, in 1478, sealed with his own private
        arms, in which latter document he stiles himself -''Archbishop of Armagh."
        It is propable that it was, during his residence at Cambridge, and after his
        appointment to the See of Armagh, that he acted as Suffragan to his old friend
        and patron, the Bishop of Ely. If so we have here a remarkable instance of
        an Irish Archbishop serving as Suffragan to an English Bishop. SYNDIC. In
        1457 we find him one of the Syndics for the erection of the Philosophical
        and Law Schools in that University. This we learn from the Proctor''s books
        at Cambridge. It was about this time that he was also appointed Proctor in
        the Court of Dr. Gray, the then Bishop of Ely. PROCTOR TO BISHOP GRAY. This
        appointment was doubtless the means of drawing him into close connexion with
        the Bishop of the Diocese. We are not surprised, therefore, to find that in
        the year 1469 he was entrusted by the Bishop with a very delicate mission.
        FIRST MISSION TO ROME. As the Bishop''s proxy, he was commissioned, in conjunction
        with Walter Buck, to visit the Holy See at Rome. This must have been during
        the Popedom of Paul II. . So faithfully and efficiently did he discharge the
        duties of this very difficult mission, that he was brought under the special
        notice ofthe King, and in the year 1471 he was chosen by Royal favour for
        a similar office. SECOND MISSION TO ROME. The cruel and vindictive Edward
        IV was then on the Throne of England On the Election of Pope SextusIV, in
        the year 1471, as the immediate successor of Pope Paul, the King thought fit
        to address to His Holiness a letter of congratulation. The conveyance of this
        letter to Rome was entrusted by the King to his Chancellor, James Gold well,
        and Dr. Coningsburgh. This was Coningsburgh''s second visit to Rome, a journey,
        which, in the present day, may be per formed in a few hours, but which was
        then a serious undertaking. So great at that time was the influence of the
        Pope, over almost every crowned head in Europe, that the King availed himself
        of this opportunity of also sending a petition to the Pope, in which he condescended
        to beg His Holiness " to grant certain things concerning his honour and dignity."',

        \ in Brook Street, in this Parish. It is a commodious building erected on\
        \ a site, lent for the purpose by the Squire. In addition to a good supply\

        \ and amusements, such as Chess, Backgammon, Draughts, Dominoes, and the old\

        \ which it does not in some way or other find an entrance. And it is weU that\

        \ the land. The body of the magazine is full of good and wholesome reading,\

        \ think of this who are inclined to boast or to lament that they receive 300\
        \ ? Every number of every newspaper in France must be received, sent for if\
        \ it fails to come, registered, put on its pile, and at the end of the year\

        \ . . . The titles of new books are printed in a bulletin in two series, French\
        \ and Foreign (causing a printer's bill of 5,000 francs a year). This began\
        \ in 1875 for the foreign, and in 1882 for the French. These bulletins are\
        \ cut up and the titles mounted on slips, which are fastened in a Leydeu binder,\
        \ three making a small folio page. The result is a series of 900 volumes,\
        \ less easy to consult than a good card catalog, very much less easy than\
        \ the British Sluseum pasted catalog, the Rudolph books, or the Rudolph machine.\
        \ . . . The books received at the Bibliotheque Nationale before 1875 aud 1882\
        \ are entered on some 2,000,000 slips, which are divided between two catalogs,\
        \ that of the old library ('fonds ancicn'), and of the intermediate library\
        \ (' fonds intermediarie '). Iu each of these catalogs they are arranged in\
        \ series according to the subject divisions given above and under each subject\
        \ alphabetically. There is no author cata log and the public are not allowed\
        \ to consult these catalogs. If then a reader asks for a work received before\
        \ 1875 the attendant guesses in which 'fonds' it is and what subject it treats\
        \ of; if he does not find it where he looks first he tries some other division.\

        \ me out-of-the-way books were mar vellous. On the other hand, when they re\

        \ of the city of Ur (probably the Biblical Ur of the Chaldees). From this\

        \ owners became dissatisfied, and the books were all taken home. Books were\
        \ then scarce, high priced, and of great bulk. Folios were still common, and\
        \ a book of less magnitude than quarto was deemed insignificant. . . . Few\
        \ books of much importance were published at less than two guineas. Such prices\
        \ as four guineas, five guineas, and six guineas were not uncommon. Deprived\
        \ of the advantage of the Junto collec tion, Franklin conceived the idea of\
        \ a subscrip tion library. Early in 1731 he drew up a plan, the substance\
        \ of which was, that each subscriber should contribute two pounds sterling\
        \ for the first purchase of books, and ten shillings a year for the increase\
        \ of the library. As few of the inhabitants of Philadelphia had money to spare,\
        \ and still fewer cared for reading, he found very great difficulty in procuring\
        \ a sufficient number of subscribers. He says: ' I put myself as much as I\
        \ could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who\
        \ had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers\
        \ of reading. In this way my affairs went on more smoothly, and I ever after\
        \ practiced it on such occasions, and from my frequent successes can heartily\
        \ recommend it. ' Yet it was not until November, 1731, at least five months\
        \ after the project was started, that fifty names were ob tained ; and not\
        \ till Slarch, 1732, that the money was collected. After consulting James\
        \ Logan, ' the best judge of books in these parts,' the first list of books\
        \ was made out, a draft upon London of forty-five pounds was purchased, and\
        \ both were placed in the hands of one of the directors who wTas going to\
        \ England. Peter Collinson undertook the purchase, and added to it presents\
        \ of Newton's 'Principia,' and 'Gardener's Dic tionary.' All the business\
        \ of the library Sir. Collinson continued to transact for thirty years, and\
        \ always swelled the annual parcel of books by gifts of valuable works. In\
        \ those days getting a parcel from London was a tedious affair indeed. All\
        \ the summer of 1732 the subscribers were waiting for the coming of the books,\
        \ as for an event of the greatest interest. ... In October the books arrived,\
        \ and were placed, at first, in the room of the Junto. A librarian was appointed,\
        \ and the library was opened once a week for giv ing out the books. The second\
        \ year Franklin himself served as librarian. For many years the secretary\
        \ to the directors was Joseph Breintnal, by whose zeal and diligence the interests\
        \ of the library were greatly promoted. Franklin printed a catalogue soon\
        \ after the arrival of the books, for which, and for other printing, he was\
        \ ex empted from paying his annual ten shillings for two years. The success\
        \ of this library, thus begun by a few mechanics and clerks, was great in\
        \ every sense of the word. Valuable donations of books, money and curiosities\
        \ were frequently made to it. The number of subscribers slowly, but steadily,\
        \ increased. Libraries of similar char acter sprung up all over the country,\
        \ and many were started even in Philadelphia. Kalm, who was in Philadelphia\
        \ in 1748, says that then the parent library had given rise to ' many little\
        \ libraries,' on the same plan as itself. He also says that non-subscribers\
        \ were then allowed to take books out of the library, by leaving a pledge\
        \ for the value of the book, and paying for a folio eight pence a week, for\
        \ a quarto six pence, and for all others four pence. ' The subscribers, '\
        \ he says, ' were so kind to me as to order the libra rian, during my stay\
        \ here, to lend me every book I should want, without requiring any payment\
        \ of me.' In 1764, the shares had risen in value to nearly twenty pounds,\
        \ and the collection was con sidered to be worth seventeen hundred pounds.\
        \ In 1785, the number of volumes was 5,487; in 1807, 14,457; in 1861, 70,000.\
        \ The institution is one of the few in America that has held on its way, unchanged\
        \ in any essential principle, for a century and a quarter, always on the increase,\
        \ always faithfully administered, always doing well its appointed work. There\
        \ is every reason to believe that it will do so for centuries to come. The\
        \ prosperity of the Philadelphia Library was owing to the original excellence\
        \ of the plan, the good sense embodied in the rules, the care with which its\
        \ affairs were conducted, and the vigi lance of Franklin and his friends in\
        \ turning to account passing events. Thomas Penn, for ex ample, visited Philadelphia\
        \ a year or two after tlie library was founded ; when the directors of the\
        \ library waited upon him with a dutiful ad dress, and received, in return,\
        \ a gift of books and apparatus. It were difficult to over-estimate the value\
        \ to the colonies of the libraries that grew out of Franklin's original conception.\
        \ They were among the chief means of educating the colonies up to Independence.\
        \ ' Reading be came fashionable,' says Franklin; 'and our peo ple having no\
        \ public amusements to divert their attention from study, became better acquainted\
        \ with books, and in a few years were observed, by strangers, to be better\
        \ instructed and more intel ligent than people of the same rank generally\
        \ are in other countries. ' . . . What the Philadel phia Library did for Franklin\
        \ himself, the li braries, doubtless, did for many others. It made him a daily\
        \ student for twenty years. He set apart an hour or two every day for study,\
        \ and thus acquired the substance of all the most valu able knowledge then\
        \ possessed by mankind. Whether Franklin was the originator of sub scription\
        \ libraries, and of the idea of permitting books to be taken to the homes\
        \ of subscribers, I cannot positively assert. But I can discover no trace\
        \ of either of those two fruitful conceptions before his time.\" \u2014 J.\

        \ of punning and of his friends.' After ward they were allotted a room in\
        \ the State- House ; and, in 1742, a charter was obtained from the Proprietaries.\

        \ collections about \xA350,000; so that even from the mercantile point of\
        \ view, the Cotton family may be said to have been larger voluntary contributors\
        \ towards our eventual Na tional Sluseum than was Sir Hans Sloane him self.\
        \ That point of view, however, would be a very false, because very narrow,\
        \ one. Whether estimated by mere money value, or by a truer standard, the\
        \ third, in order of time, of the Foundation-Collections, \u2014 that of the\
        \ ' Harle ian Slanuscripts,' \u2014 was a much less important acquisition\
        \ for the Nation than was the Sluseum of Sloane, or the Library of Cotton\
        \ ; but its literary value, as all students of our history and literature\
        \ know, is, nevertheless, considerable. Its first Collector, Robert Harley,\
        \ the Slinister of Queen Anne and the first of the Harleian Earls of Oxford,\
        \ is fairly entitled to rank, after Cotton, Courten, and Sloane, among the\
        \ virtual or eventual co-founders of the British Sluseum. Chronologically,\
        \ then, Sir Robert Cotton, Will iam Courten, Hans Sloane, and Robert Harley,\
        \ rank first as Founders ; so long as we estimate their relative position\
        \ in accordance with the successive steps by which the British Sluseum was\
        \ eventually organized. But there is another synchronism by which greater\
        \ accuracy is attain able. Although four years had elapsed between the passing\

        \ use \u2022of the said Collections, and of the Cottonian Li brary and of\
        \ the additions thereto,' and the gift \u2014 in 1757 \u2014 to the Trustees\
        \ of those already united Collections by King George II. of the Old Royal\

        \ had been (in a re stricted sense of the words) a Public and National possession\
        \ soon after the days of the first real and central Founder of the present\
        \ Sluseum, Sir Robert Cotton. But, despite its title, that Royal Library,\
        \ also, was \u2014 in the main \u2014 the creation of subjects, not of Sovereigns\
        \ or Gov ernments. Its virtual sounder was Henry, prince of Wales [son of\
        \ James I.]. It was acquired, out of his privy purse, as a subject, not as\
        \ a Prince. He, therefore, has a title to be placed among the individual Collectors\
        \ whose united ef forts resulted \u2014 after long intervals of time \u2014\

        \ . . On the 15th of January, 1759, the British Sluseum was opened for the\
        \ inspection and use of the public. At first the Sluseum was divided into\
        \ three de- partments, viz.. Printed Books, Slanuscripts, and Natural History;\
        \ at the head of each of them was placed an officer designated as ' Under\
        \ Librarian. ' Tlie increase of the collections soon rendered it necessary\
        \ to provide additional ac- commodation for them, Slontague House prov- ing\
        \ insufficient. The present by George III. of Egyptian Antiquities, and the\
        \ purchase of the Hamilton and Townley Antiquities, made it moreover imperative\
        \ to create an additional de- partment \u2014 that of Antiquities and Art\
        \ \u2014 to which were united the Prints and Drawings, as well as the Sledals\
        \ and Coins, previously at- tached to the library of Printed Books and Slanu-\
        \ scripts. The acquisition of the Elgin Slarbles in 1816 made the Department\
        \ of Antiquities of the highest importance, and increased room being indispensable\
        \ for the exhibition of those marbles, a temporary shelter was prepared for\
        \ them. This was the last addition to Montague House. When, in 1823, the library\
        \ collected by George III. was presented to the nation by George IV. it became\
        \ necessary to erect a building fit to re- ceive this valuable and extensive\
        \ collection. It was then decided to have an entirely new edifice to contain\
        \ the whole of the Sluseum collection, including the recently-acquired library.\
        \ Sir R. Smirke was accordingly directed by the Trustees to prepare plans.\
        \ The eastern side of the pres- ent structure was completed in 1828, and the\
        \ Royal Library was then placed in it. The north- ern, southern, and western\
        \ sides of the building were subsequently added, and in 1845 the whole of\
        \ Slontague House and its additions had disap- peared; while the increasing\
        \ collections had rendered it necessary to make various additions to the original\
        \ design of Sir R. Smirke, some of them even before it had been carried out.\"\

        \ 258 feet long by 184 feet in width, thus leaving an interval of from 27\

        \ drafted a school bill which contained provisions for school and township\
        \ libraries, and succeeded in awakening a deep interest in the subject. ...\
        \ In 1854 Parliament passed the requisite act and granted him the necessary\
        \ funds to carry out his views in the matter. The regu lations of the department\
        \ authorized each county council to establish four classes of libraries \u2014\
        \ 1. An ordinary common school library in each schoolhouse for the use of\
        \ the children and rate payers. 2. A general public lending library available\
        \ to all the ratepayers in the municipal ity. 3. A professional library of\
        \ books on teaching, school organization, language, and kindred subjects,\
        \ available for teachers only. 4. A library in any public institution under\
        \ the con trol of the municipality, for the use of the in mates, or in any\
        \ county jail, for the use of the prisoners. . . . The proposal to establish\
        \ the second class was however premature; and ac cordingly, finding that mechanics\
        \ institutes were being developed throughout the towns and vil lages, the\
        \ Educational Department wisely aided the movement by giving a small grant\
        \ propor tionate to the amount contributed by the mem bers and reaching a\
        \ maximum of \xA7200, afterwards increased to $400 annually. In 1869 these\
        \ had grown to number 26; in 1880, 74; and in 1886, 125. The number of volumes\
        \ possessed by these 125 is 206,146, or an average of 1,650. ... In the cities,\
        \ however, the mechanics institute, with its limited number of subscribers,\
        \ has been found unequal to the task assigned it, and accordingly, in 1882,\
        \ the Free Libraries Act was passed, based upon similar enactments in Britain\
        \ and the United States. . . . By the Free Libraries Act, the maximum of taxation\

        \ ADAMS.1 [To the Editor of the \" National Intelligencer,\" Federal City?]\
        \ Towards the latter end of last December I received a letter from a venerable\
        \ patriot, Samuel Adams, dated Bos ton, Nov. 30. It came by a private hand,\
        \ which I suppose was the cause of the delay. I wrote Mr. Adams an answer,\
        \ dated Jan. 1st, and that I might be certain of his receiving it, and also\
        \ that I might know of that reception, I desired a 1 The Hon. Samuel Adams\
        \ (1722\u2014 1803) was from the StampAct agitation of 1764 to the Declaration\
        \ of Independence in 1776 the pre-eminent revolutionary leader in Massachusetts,\
        \ and General Gage was given orders to send him over to London, where a newspaper\
        \ predicted that his head would appear on Temple Bar. He was sent by Massachusetts,\
        \ with his cousin, John Adams, afterwards President, to the first Continental\
        \ Congress (1774), where he was suspected, with justice, of being favorable\
        \ to separation from England. When Paine published his famous appeal for American\
        \ Independence (January 10, 1776), Samuel Adams was the first member of the\
        \ Congress at his side, and a cordial lifelong relation existed between the\
        \ two. It is to my mind certain that these two men were the real pioneers\
        \ of American Independence, and they were both inspired therein by their widely\
        \ different religious sentiments. Samuel Adams was the son of a deacon of\
        \ the Old South Church, Boston, who sent his son to Harvard College with the\
        \ hope that he would graduate into a minister. The son had no taste for theology,\
        \ but he made up for it by retaining through all his career as a lawyer and\
        \ public man a rigid Puritanism, of which the first article was hatred of\
        \ the British system of royalty and prelacy. While Adams's desire for American\
        \ independency was largely an inheritance from New England Puritans, Paine\
        \ beheld in it a means of establishing a Republic based on the principles\
        \ of Quakerism, \u2014 the divine Light in every man by virtue of which all\
        \ were equal. Samuel Adams died October 2, 1803. The correspondence here given\
        \ was printed in the National Intelligencer , Washington City, February 2,\
        \ 1803, as one of a series of Ten Letters addressed to \" The Citizens of\
        \ the United States \" on his return after his fifteen eventful years in Europe.\
        \ These Letters were printed in a pamphlet in London, 1804, by his friend\
        \ Thomas Clio Rickman, whose task, however, was achieved under sad intimidation.\
        \ Rick man's preface opens with the words: \" The following little work would\
        \ not have been published, had there been anything in it the least offending\
        \ against the government or individuals.\" Under this deadly fear the much\
        \ prosecuted Rickman mutilated Paine's letter to Adams a good deal. I have\
        \ been fortun ate in being able to print the letter from Paine's own manuscript,\
        \ which was recently discovered among the papers of George Bancroft, the historian,\
        \ when they passed into the possession of the Lenox Library, New York, to\
        \ whose ex cellent librarian I owe thanks for this and other favors. \u2014\

        \ the Temple of Hevoth, and he may be called the father of all gods. Three\
        \ years ago I came upon a papyrus written by the Theban scribe Ennana who\
        \ was, I need hardly tell you, the Royal Librarian to Merenptah the Pharaoh\
        \ of the Exodus. It was, as usual, inclosed in an earthen cy linder, and it\
        \ contained a reference to the excavations which were then exciting a good\
        \ deal of interest in antiquarian circles in Egypt. The Temple of Hevoth and\
        \ the Court of the Thousand Pillars seemed, according to this document, to\
        \ promise excellent results to the arch\xE6ologists. Over a thousand years\
        \ had passed since they had disappeared, as all things Egyptian disappear,\
        \ in the sands, and reference was made to its ancient glories when Hevoth\
        \ was still worshipped. It was that papyrus which led me to search for the\
        \ Temple. After a year I found it, but not by excavation.\" \" How, then?\"\

        entered the artillery school at Grenoble, when he ran away with two of his
        comrades to travel. They went on foot to Marseilles, and engaged as cabin
        boys. They visited Greece, the East, and Alexandria, where, attacked by fever,
        they went into a hospital, having no money. The two companions of Mauduit
        died. Tbe latter, being left alone, went to Constantinople, and was sent home
        by the French ambassador. His family received him very well. He studied for
        the artillery, and left in 1777 for America. He distinguished himself on the
        4th of October, 1777, at the battle of Germantown, where he attacked with
        twenty eight men a " white house," which was the key of the English position.
        He escaped scot free from this reckless attempt. All his soldiers were killed,

        of shelter and provisions, and from tbe fatiguing marches in thick forests

        Griffith, the librarian of the Houses of Legislature, Mr. Donovan, Captain
        Heath, and the officials connected with the marine departments, and Bishop
        Thornhill, appointed to Queensland from active work in a London parish. In
        such hands the resources of the colony will not be neglected. During our visit
        we made an excursion to the first agricultural show at Marburg, an interesting
        German settlement, formed in the last twenty years. The settlers have, by
        the most laborious efforts, cut down the dense scrub with which this part
        of the country was covered. Their frugality, their patience under many privations,
        and their industry, have been rewarded. They grow maize, sugar, tobacco, and
        vegetables, but their cattle seem to be the most thriving and successful part
        of their business. In some seasons want of water, and in every season the
        heavy rainfall at the period when the grain is coming to maturity, are serious
        draw backs to agriculture in this district. On the whole, it may be said that
        Queensland is far more adapted to be a pastoral than an agricultural country.

        \ I don't recollect the title of the book I want, but there was a remarkable\
        \ passage in the last chapter which I should recollect if I saw it again.\"\
        \ Amusing as this was, it is not the only laugh able request a librarian meets\

        \ of authors jumbled up in an unrecognisable mass in their efforts to convince\
        \ us that they are thoroughly au fait with current literature. Only a few\
        \ days ago a customer came along with the order to supply him with one of\
        \ \"Rye Arrocks \" books. Now not being certain whether any author had at\
        \ some remote period sported so poetic a name, I questioned the young fellow\

        \ of his illustrious literary ancestor, and with a pardonable pride he determined\
        \ to insure the immortality of his ancestor's works. He caused copies of them\
        \ to be made and to be placed in all the Libraries of the great Roman Empire,\
        \ and every year he was careful that no less than 10 complete copies of the\
        \ works of Tacitus should be transcribed. But this well intentioned imperial\
        \ protection was utterly powerless against the changes and ravages of time.\
        \ The Roman Libraries all, somehow or another, perished, and it is a striking\
        \ fact, that to a single incomplete but priceless copy of Tacitus, discovered\
        \ in a monastery of Westphalia, the world possesses to-day the invaluable\

        \ thought of leaving his friend honourably, if unambitiously, provided for,\
        \ as secretary and librarian to Sir Miles St. John. In fact, the scholar,\
        \ who possessed considerable powers of fascination, had won no less favour\
        \ with the English baronet than he had with the French dic tator. He played\
        \ well both at chess and backgammon ; he was an extraordinary accountant ;\
        \ he had a variety of infor mation upon all points, that rendered him more\
        \ convenient than any cyclop\xE6dia in Sir Miles's library ; and as he spoke\
        \ both English and Italian with a correctness and fluency extremely rare in\
        \ a Frenchman, he was of considerable service in teaching languages to (as\
        \ well as directing the general literary education of) Sir Miles's favourite\

        \ Nevertheless, there had been one serious obstacle to Dalibard's acceptance\
        \ of the appointment offered to him by Sir Miles. Dalibard had under his charge\
        \ a young orphan boy of some ten or twelve years old \u2014 a boy whom Sir\
        \ Miles was not long in suspecting to be the scholar's son. This chdd had\

        \ remained under the eye and care of his guardian or father, whichever was\
        \ the true connection between the two. But this superintendence be came impossible,\

        \ in London; nor, though the generous old gentleman offered to pay for the\
        \ child' s schooling, would Dalibard consent to part with him. At last, the\
        \ matter was arranged: the boy was invited to Laughton on a visit, and was\
        \ so lively, yet so well man nered, that he became a favourite, and was now\
        \ fairly quartered in the house with his reputed father: and not to make an\
        \ unnecessary mystery of this connection, such was in truth the relationship\

        \ of the chamber, in its divisions, lent itself admirably to that friendly\
        \ and sociable intermixture of amusements which reconciles the tastes of young\

        \ Gilray's caricatures, the last new publications, and such other ingenious\

        \ yet found elsewhere their evening's amusement; two or three shy young clergymen,\
        \ the parish doctor, four or five squires, who felt great inter est in politics,\

        \ now, monopolising all the journals they could find, began fairly with the\
        \ heroic reso lution to skip nothing, from the first advertisement to the\
        \ printer's name. Amidst one of these groups, Mainwaring had bashfully ensconced\
        \ himself. In the further division, the chandelier, suspended from the domed\
        \ ceiling, threw its cheerful light over a large circular table below, on\
        \ which gleamed the ponderous tea-urn of massive silver, with its usual accompaniments.\
