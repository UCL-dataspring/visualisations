        This library is an insu lated building, in the middle of a square court, consisting

  - - ["TURKEY IN EUROPE.' 206 Language.] The Turkish language is of far inferior\
        \ reputation to ihe Persian or Arabic, being a mixture of several dialects,\
        \ and possessing neither the force, elegance, nor purity of those two celebrated\
        \ oriental tongues. Literature is not however totally neglected, and it has\
        \ been repeatedly attempted to establish a printing press at Constantinople\
        \ ; but the design failed from the interest of the copyists, who inferred\
        \ that this art would deprive them of their bread. A late traveller informs\
        \ us that there are in this capital several kuttub-chans, or public liberaries,\
        \ among which are those of St. Sophia and the Solimanie Jamasy ; but none\
        \ are so elegant as that sounded by the grand vizir Raghid, which is wholly\
        \ i-crilt of marble in the midst ofa square court, and is silled with books,\
        \ chiefly theological. A librarian constantly attends, and there are con-\
        \ venient seats with carpets and cushions. In the neighbourhood is a school\
        \ founded by the same vizier, in which about ioo boys are taught to read and\
        \ write. The market for books is extensive, containing many shops well supplitd\
        \ with oriental manuscripts. The Turks have their ancient poets, historians,\
        \ and divines ; but of little reputation when com- pared with those of Persia\
        \ or Arabia. Education.] The state of education among the Turks may be con\xBB\
        \ ceived to be very low, and ignorance is indeed a chief pant of the national\
        \ character. The only profession which requires a stiadow of learning is 'hat\
        \ of the law, which, as before explained, is intimately connected with their\
        \ theology. The celebrated doctors have disciples, who are trained Tip to\
        \ that department .but there seems nothing that can deserve the name of college\
        \ or university. Cities antj towns.] The chief city of European Turkey, and\
        \ of the Turkish empire, is Constantinople, so called because sounded by Con-\
        \ stantine on the lite of the ancient Byzantium. The advantages ofthe situation\
        \ can hardly be exceeded, and the aspect from the sea is peculiarly grand\
        \ ; but on a nearer approach, the wooden hovels and narrow streets disappoint\
        \ the splendid expectations ofthe spectator. This capital forms an unequal\
        \ triangle, resembling a harp, being about twelve or fourteen English liiles.\
        \ in circumference, inclosed by walls, and on two sides by the sea and the\
        \ harbour called the Golden Horn. The inhabitants are com- puted at 400,0'\
        \ o, including the four suburbs, Galata, Pera, Tophana, and Scutari. Of these\
        \ 2cc,coo are Turks, ico,coo Greek, and the re- mainder Jews, Armenians, and\
        \ Franks. The most celebrated edifices are the Seraglio, which comprizes a\

        rabble, seized and destroy ed the university charters, plundered Bene''t College,
        and threatened the university with fire and sword, if they did not renounce
        their privileges, and subject them selves for the future to the government
        of the townsmen. The consequence of this rassi proceeding, was the king''s
        decision that all privileges, hitherto enjoyed by the town, ssiould be forfeited,
        and they were thereupon granted to the university ; particularly the inspection
        of weights and measures, the licensing of victualling houses, the jurisdiction
        of Sturbridge fair, the regulating the price of candles and fuel, and the
        punissiment of forestallers and regraters. At the fame time the univer sity
        obtained a grant that no action ssiould be brought against any scholar, or
        scho lar''s servant, by a townsman, in any other than the chancellor''s court.
        In 1430, Pope Martin V. determined, from the testimony of ancient evi dences,
        that the university were exclusively possessed of all ecclesiastical and spiritual
        jurisdiction over their own scholars. Queen Elizabeth, in the third year of
        her reign, granted an extensive charter to the university ; and, by an act

        and the university is declared to be incorporated by the name of the chancellor,
        masters, and scholars. The office of chancellor, as chief magistrate of the
        university, had existed from a very early period : it was only annual till
        the year 1504, when Bissiop Fissier was chosen chancellor for life : the other
        principal offi cers are the high steward ; the vice-chancellor ; two proctors,

        of bread, and inspect the weights and measures ; two scrutators, who regulate
        the business of the congregations; a public orator; a commis- sary ; a registrar
        ; three esquire bedels ; two librarians ; and several inferior officers. In
        the year 1604, King James granted the universities of Cambridge and Oxford
        the privilege of sending each two representatives to Parliament. The public
        buildings, belonging to the university, are the schools, the public library,

        on the east side is a lecture room for the professors fitted up in 1795 ;
        this side was originally built by Archbissiop Rotheram in 1475. There is an

        \ given by others z. The north and west sides were then fitted up. Before\
        \ this time there had been but one librarian, who was called Keeper of the\
        \ University Library. The place of principal librarian, then newly created,\
        \ was given to the celebrated Dr. Conyers Middleton, on account, as it is\
        \ said, of his having, when at Rome, successfully maintained the honour and\
        \ dignity of the university. The library is supposed to contain atpresent\
        \ about 96,000 volumes. Among the books most rare and worthy of notice in\
        \ this extensive library, are a MS. copy of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles,\
        \ a sac-simile of which was printed under the care of Dr. Kipling, and a large\
        \ collection of the earliest printed books by Caxton, and from the foreign\

        Wray by Dance. The Gardens, on the other side of the river, are connected
        with the college by a wooden bridge of one arch, (built in 1746,) which has
        been much admired for the ingenuity of its construction. Catherine Hall was
        founded in 1475 by Robert Woodlark, third provost of King''s College, and
        chancellor of the university, who endowed it for a master and three fellows.
        In the reign of K. Edward VI. the number of fellowssiips was increased to
        six ; besides which there are eight bye-fellowssiips ; one of which was founded
        by Mr. Frankland, for a person educated at Coventry school ; one by Mr. HoLvay,
        called the conduct-fellowssiip ; and six for natives of Yorkssiire and Lincolnshire,
        by Mrs. Ramsden. The senior fellowssiips are open, but there must not be more
        than two fellows of any county at the fame time. Mrs. Ramsden founded also
        to scholar ssiips of 20I. per annum each, for natives of Lincolnssiire and
        Yorkssiire ; and there are 16 other scholarssiips of smaller value. An act
        of Parliament was procured by the college in 1756, to enable them to purchase
        a site, and erect buildings for the reception of Mrs. Ramsden''s fellows and
        scholars. Queen Anne annexed a prebend of Norwich to the mastership of this
        college. The Lord Chancellor is visitor. There are only four livings in the
        gift of this society ; one in Cambridgessiire ; one in Essex ; and two in
        Norfolk. Among the eminent persons educated at Catherine Hall, may be reckoned
        Arch bishop Sandys ; John Strype, the antiquary ; Ray, the naturalist ; Dr.
        Lightfoot, the orientalist ; Bissiop Blackall ; Bissiop Hoadley ; and Bissiop
        Sherlock. The last mentioned prelate bequeathed his valuable library to the
        college, and gave a salary of 20 1. per annum to a librarian. Catherine Hall
        is situated on the west side of Trumpington street ; the buildings occupy
        three sides of a court, the east side being open to the street. The cha pel
        was consecrated in the year 1704 ; in the antechapel is a monument for the
        lady of Sir William Dawes, Bart, master of the Hall, and afterwards Archbissiop
        of York ; that of Dr. John Eachard, a great benefactor to this college, of
        which he was master, and author of a well-known work, entitled, " Reasons
        for the Con? tempt of the Clergy," who died in 1697 ; and the tomb of Dr.
        John Addenbrooke, fellow of the college, and sounder of the hospital which
        bears his name, who died in 1719. Jesus College was founded in 1496 by John
        Alcock, Bissiop of Ely, who had ob tained from King Henry VII. a grant of
        the nunnery of St. Radegund, then lately oppressed ; all the lands which had
        been given to that monastery, were given as an 1 endowment,', 1]

        Alexander; and that he requested them to transmit some remon strances by the
        abbot to the Dadian. The ambassadors replied that they had re ceived no commands
        from their sovereign respecting the Dadian, and consequently could not send
        any message by the abbot. They promised him, however, that if he should succeed
        in reconciling the prince with the king, and the former should place himself
        under the protection of Russia, he (the abbot) should be rewarded by the Zar
        and grand-prince of all the Russias beyond his expectation. July 6th, the
        king went to the towii of Skalda. He sent to the ambassadors, desiring they
        would not think any thing of this, as public affairs obliged him to repair
        thither; adding, that in three days he would order them to be fetched, and
        would, during that interval, send for Ring Theimuras, that he might finish
        their business in his presence, anel meanwhile they might remove to his palace
        in the town of Little Rhuthais. The ambassadors did so on the 8th of July.
        The pa lace was an extensive edifice, with many spacious apartments, on the
        walls of which were painted the battles of Alexanders predecessors. Behind
        the palace was a large garden with many fruit-trees. On the 1 3th, Zacharias
        the metropolitan brought this message : the king begged them not to be uneasy
        at his not having yet sent for them ; he would do so as soon as his affairs
        permitted ; meanwhile he proposed to them to see whatever was worthy of notice
        in the cities of Golethi and Great Rhuthais. This proposal they accepted with
        great pleasure. They first rode to Golethi, a considerable place, containing
        many fine and superbly ornamented churches. Thence they proceeded to Great
        Rhuthais, the capital and residence of the king; where they found many stone
        churches and palaces. Among the relics they particularly noticed a picture
        of the mother of God, painted, as they were assured, by St. Luke the evangelist.
        The Emperor Constantine is reported to have given it by way of blessing to
        his daughter on her marriage to Davit, king of Imerethi. July 1 8th, two monks
        came from Mount Athos to Great Rhuthais, to receive from the farmers the rents
        of their lands left by pious people to their convent in Imerethi. They related
        that they had been in the monastery of Chotei at Diana, where, from time immemorial,

        \ the year 1751, when Archbishop Price un roofed the choir, and, by thus exposing\

        \ ancient sculpture, and is said to have been founded in the latter part of\
        \ the ninth, or beginning of the tenth, century, by Cormac, son of Culinan,\
        \ king of Munster, and archbishop of Cashel. The archbishop's palace is a\
        \ plain, but commodious, building; and the new church is a neat edifice. Here\

        \ by the generous sacrifice of a large part of his fortune, effected, in the\
        \ short space of seven years, a complete metamorphosis. He repaired the cathedral,\

        the study of anatomy with great diligence, under Marc Antonio della Torre,
        Professor of Anatomy at Pavia, and practised dissections, from which he made
        many drawings, subjoining the neces sary verbal explanations. These drawings,
        after his death, were collect ed by his pupil Melzi, and now form a part of

        of the King''s Librarian, Mr. Chamberlaine, who has added a short history
        of the life of Leonardo, and also a version of the explanations and observa
        tions upon the drawings. It is not undeserving notice, that the draw ings
        above alluded to, are not merely copies of those muscles which lie under the
        skin, and of those parts of the body which are useful to the painter in his

        \ Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any potentate from\
        \ the banks of the Danube to the borders of China.\" Military and Naval Force]\
        \ Every man in the Birman empire is liable to military service, but the regular\
        \ army is very inconsiderable. During war, the viceroys raise one recruit\
        \ from every two, three, or four houses, which otherwise pay a fine of about\
        \ forty pounds sterling. The fomily of the soldier are detained as hostages\
        \ ; and, in case of cowardice or. desertion, suffer death. The infantry are\
        \ not regularly clothed, but are armed with muskets aud sabres ; while the\
        \ cavalry carry spears, about seven or eight feet in length. The royal magazines\
        \ are said to con tain about twenty thousand miserable firelocks. But the\
        \ war-boats form the chief military establishment, consisting of about five\
        \ hundred, formed out' of the solid trunk of the teak-tree, the length from\
        \ eighty to- a hundred feet, but the breadth rarely exceeding eight. Tbe prow\
        \ is solid, with a flat surface, on which a piece of ordnance is mounted ;\
        \ the rowers are provided with swords and lances, and the soldiers are armed\
        \ with muskets; and each boat is usually manned by about eighty or ninety\
        \ men. The attack is impetuous, and chiefly conducted by grappling ; but,\
        \ the vessels lying low in the water, the greatest dan ger is that of being\
        \ run down, by a larger boat striking the broad-side. Manufactures and Commerce]\
        \ The Birmans are very expert in gilding, and other ornamental manufactures.\
        \ Their edifices and boats are constructed with taste and elegance; and at\
        \ one of their villages is a manufacture of marble idols, the materials being\
        \ remarkably fine, and almost transparent. On the declaration of war, the\
        \ heralds proclaim tlieir sovereign's will with flaming torches in their hands\
        \ ; and the governors of provinces are obliged to raise such a number of troops\
        \ as the state wants, in addition to the accustomed military establishment.\
        \ Upon these occa sions, a troop of perhaps- several hundreds of elephants\
        \ are seen in full march,- the king seated on his throne upon the back of\
        \ oue of tbe whitest, attended by all his nobles, with trumpets, and other\
        \ military music, sounding as they march to the field of battle. A very considerable\
        \ trade is carried on between the capital of Ava and Unan, the nearest province\
        \ of China, consisting chiefly in cotton, with amber, ivory, pre cious stones,\
        \ and beetle-nuts ; the returns being raw and wrought silks, velvets, gold-leaf,\
        \ preserves*, paper, and some utensils of hardware. Some thousands of boats\
        \ are employed every year in transporting rice from the lower provinces, to\
        \ supply Unanratoora and the northern districts. European broad-cloths, and\
        \ hardware coarse Bengal muslins, China-ware and glass, are imported by foreigners.\
        \ The Birmans, like the Chinese, have no coin \u25A0 but their currency consists\
        \ of silver in bullion and lead. Commerce derives most-.essential service\

        permit them to view the valuable editions of some ofthe classics which are
        amongst his collection. Accordingly I ad dressed myself to the Librarian (a

        to appre hend, that I had committed a great crime in mentioning the National
        Institute, and that the gentleman to whom I had addressed myself, entertained
        much the same opinion as myself, of the generality of its members; and might
        have been fearful of missing some of his precious volumes, if he had acquiesced
        in my request, although there are not two better men living than Parmentier
        (no friend of the revo lution) and Huzard. I therefore took my leave. But
        I had also waiting in the carriage at the door, two other visitors, the Duke
        de St. Simon, and another foreign gentleman, but not a Frenchman, the intimate
        friend of the Abbe Sieyes. I reported to the latter the dilemma into which
        we had all fallen, and every thing that had passed. "Pshaw!" said he, " why
        did you say a syllable about the Members of the Institute ? You should have

        course of the conversation which took place, a very extraordinary discovery
        was made. The Li brarian addressing himself to Parmentier, inquired with great
        earnestness, " whether M. Parmentier were alive and well ?" " I am he!" The
        surprize of all present was great beyond description, every one conjecturing
        what was to come next, when the Librarian informed us, that many years ago
        he had translated into his native language, an admirable treatise of Parrnentier''s
        on the Use and Cultivation of Potatoes. This interview between men so closely
        connected in the literary world, would never have occurred, had not my ingenious

        \ towers, connected by rectilinear apartments, which form an irregular quadrangular\
        \ court within. The walls are from twelve to nine feet thick. In the civil\

        \ garrison for the King, commanded by Sir John Mallory, of Studley. On the\
        \ 20th Dec. 1645, it was surrendered to the forces of the Parliament; having\
        \ held out longer than any other Castle in the north of England. The northern\
        \ wall ofthe Castle stands on the brink of a perpendicular rock, washed by\
        \ a tor rent, to the bed of which, from the battlements, is a depth of 200\
        \ feet. At the west-end ofthe Bailey stands the Castle Chapel, a well proportioned\

        \ when all his estates were escheated to the Crown ; and were by that King\

        narch''s expedition had already perished, and the observations of Alexander
        were new to Grecian inquirers. He followed also the example of Darius, in
        sending an expedition down the Indus, which, commanded by Nearchus, entered
        the ocean, and returned by the Persian gulf. The narrative of this voyage
        is still preserved, and has been admirably illustrated by Dr Vincent. * The
        successors of Alexander did not cease to contribute to the progress of geography.
        The expedition of Seleucus into India procured new materials for the delineation
        of that interest ing region. Patrocles, his admiral, published a treatise
        of geo graphy, in which he included, not only his own observations, but most
        of those which had been made by Alexander''s sur veyors ; so that it contained
        ample materials for the delineation of the eastern part of the world, -f-
        It was at Alexandria, however, that all these materials were arranged and
        systematised. This city, chosen by Alexander with such peculiar felieity,
        soon became a centre for the commerce of the three continents, and afforded
        excellent opportunities of geographical inquiry. These advantages were improved
        by the splendid and enlightened patronage of the Ptolemies, particu larly
        of Ptolemy Philadelphus. That prince sent into India, for the purpose of making
        additional observations, Megasthe nes and Dionysius, who appear to have penetrated
        as far as the Ganges. Science was still more benefited by the immense library
        which that prince formed at Alexandria. Eratosthenes, who was its librarian,
        possessed thus every opportunity which books or observation could afford,
        for constructing a fabric of geographi cal knowledge. His abilities being
        equal to the task, he accord ingly formed a system, placed for the first time
        on the foundation of science, and which, in respect to the soundness of its
        general principles, surpasses perhaps that of any other ancient geographer.
        His successor Hipparchus made considerable improvements, particularly in the
        astronomical parts of the science. He intro duced the practice of expressing

        time made publick, was the eldest son of sir John Ashburnham, by his marriage
        with Elizabeth, daughter of sir Thomas Beaumont ; and was born in the year
        1603. To relate the little, which is known of his pri vate life, would neither
        gratify curiosity, nor excite interest. The following Notices will therefore
        be confined to such few facts and dates, as may in some sort connect his personal
        biography with the general history of the times, in which he lived. In 1628,
        Ashburnham was first appointed a groom of the bedchamber to king Charles the
        first. This is discovered in the third volume of " Original Letters illustrative
        of English History," edited by Mr. Ellis, now most worthily the prin cipal
        librarian to the British Museum. In a letter of Joseph Mead''s dated Nov.
        1st, 1628, it is mentioned that " young Ashburnham " the duke''s nephew is

        \ and con cisely as possible. In the year 626, Edwin, the Saxon king of Northumberland,\
        \ whose residence was in this city, became a convert to Christianity, under\
        \ the teaching of Paulinus, a priest sent from the Court of Rome; but the\
        \ city was then reduced to so low a condition, as not to furnish a temple\
        \ suitable for performing the ceremony of baptism. A small oratory of wood\
        \ was therefore erected for tbe occasion, on the site ofthe present Minster,\
        \ and dedicated to St. Peter, in which the king and his two sons were baptized\
        \ on Easter-day, 627. Paulinus, afterwards archbishop of York, by order of\
        \ Edwin, laid the foundation of a large stone building, including the wooden\
        \ church, which was not completed, the prelate having to leave England, in\
        \ consequence of king Edwin being killed in battle at Halfield Chase, in Yorkshire.\
        \ Oswald, who was afterwards king, commenced its completion in 632, but it\
        \ nearly became a prey to Penda, the Pagan king of Mercia, who conquered and\
        \ slew Oswald. The Cathedral, then erected with stone, was a square building,\
        \ dedicated to St. Peter, the feast of which dedication was annually held\
        \ in the Minster, on the 1st of October and seven days after. Wilfred was\
        \ the next archbishop, and in 669 he repaired the walls, and renewed the roof,\
        \ which he covered with lead. During his occupancy of the see, the noble library\
        \ of archbishop Egbert, who had appointed the learned Alcuin his librarian,\
        \ was added, which must at that time have been a most valuable treasure. The\
        \ famous Alcuin has been considered by some a native of this city ; it is\
        \ certain, however, that he was educated here, and was perhaps the most extraordinary\
        \ instance of learning and piety of any who flourished in so early an age.\
        \ In 741, the Cathedral suffered much by fire, and it was afterwards rebuilt\
        \ by archbishop Albert, a learned native, (who was promoted to the see in\

        of Sacred Music Was organized in October, 1835. The object of this asso ciation
        is the cultivation of sacred music generally, but more particularly the improvement
        of the music in churches and for charitable purposes. The officers of the
        academy are a president, two vice presidents, a secretary, a treasurer, a

        their own number a committee of three, who are styled " Music Committee."
        They have also the power to appoint a professor to the academy, to hold his
        office during the pleasure ofthe board. Regular meetings of the academy for

        of the machinery that enters into it is made of the man aging committees and
        councils appointed by the different parishes and circles ; so that the business
        of government, after all, seems to be to form the general plan and exercise
        a general supervision, while the immediate superintendency falls upon the
        people imme diately concerned. This gives a general interest in the schools,
        which could not otherwise be secured, and which is indispensable to the success
        of the plan. So satisfied is the government of the necessity of enlisting
        the popular feeling in order to secure suc cess, that, when the new provinces
        on the Rhine were acquired by the arrangement of 1815, the law requiring parents
        to send their children to school under the sanction of severe penalties was
        suspended until, by gentler means, a public sentiment could be formed in favour
        of popular education. In 1825 this law was also put in force in these provinces.
        It is supposed that there is now scarcely a child in all the Prussian dominions
        capable in body and mind of attending and receiving instruction between the
        ages of seven and fourteen, who is not in a process of primary or higher instruction.
        In 1831, out of a population of twelve millions, seven hundred and twenty
        six thousand, eight hundred and twenty-three, which was the re ported population
        of the entire kingdom, there were attending the public primary schools two
        millions, twenty-one thousand, four hundred and twenty-one. In addition to
        her primary schools and private seminaries, Prussia has one hundred and ten
        higher schools called gymnasia ; and, above these, she has six universities
        ; viz., at Berlin, the capital of the kingdom ; at Halle in Saxony ; at Bonn
        on the Rhine ; at Breslau in Silesia (this is principally under the con trol
        of the Catholics) ; at Konigsberg in East Prussia ; and at Greifswalde in
        Pomerania. These universities are generally in a very flourishing condition,
        and are, as well as the other universi ties of Germany, supplied, for the
        most part, with splendid libraries. I had the pleasure of an extended and
        very agreeable travel ling acquaintance while passing down the Rhine, during
        our stay at Rotterdam, and on our passage to London, with Count Falken stein,
        a counsellor of Saxony, and royal librarian at Dresden ;', 1]

        with those of Cambridge. The edifices, for the most part, appeared old and
        weather-beaten. Some of the buildings are more modern. Among these is the
        Radcliffe Library, which is very well as a monument, but is anything but a
        convenient edifice for a library It is a rotunda, with a dome ; above the
        floor for the library is a circular gallery, under which are the books. The
        room is too dark and every way inconvenient. There are about 15,000 volumes
        in this great cenotaph of Dr. Radcliffe, who was the founder of the library.
        He left forty thousand pounds for its erection, one hundred and fifty pounds
        per annum for the librarian, one hundred pounds for the purchase of books,
        and the same sum for repairing the edifice annually. From the dome there is
        a fine view of the town and adjoining country. Robert Hall was so enchanted
        with the view, that he called it the " New Jerusalem descending from heaven
        ;" but his brother, Andrew Fuller, was desirous of hastening down, to go to
        his lodgings for the purpose of discussing the doctrine of " Justification
        by faith !" These anecdotes are remembered and repeated, in order to illustrate
        the characteristics of these two eminent men. Perhaps I did not feel the enthusiasm
        of the former ; but I felt no haste, I confess, to descend from this commanding
        observatory to discuss any question in philosophy or theology. There is a
        very good collection in natural history called the Ashmolean Museum. It is
        said to be the first collection for va rieties in art or nature ever established
        in England. The founda tion was by a donation from Elias Ashmole, in 1677.
        In a quadrangle called the Schools, an edifice belonging to the university,
        and used for examinations and other public purposes, is the Bodleian Library,
        so called after Sir Thomas Bodley, who was the principal founder, and who
        died in 1612. This is a li brary worthy of this ancient university. It contains
        about four hundred thousand volumes. Here are many valuable manu scripts,
        European and oriental. No books are allowed to be taken out ; but all graduates
        of the university, and literary stran gers who are well recommended, are allowed
        an entrance and the use of the books. In the same building is a picture-gallery,
        con taining pictures, busts, and some very sine models of the most celebrated
        ancient edifices.', 1]

        the character and management of the German libraries. The following facts
        respecting the Dresden library may give some general idea of the regulations
        and extensive advantages of the German libraries. The number of volumes is
        three hundred thousand. To manage the library there are one principal librarian,
        two assistants, and four secretaries. Every man, high or low, appertaining
        to Sax ony, may, by giving a sufficient guaranty that the books shall be returned,
        take out three or four volumes ; and even strangers and foreigners are favoured
        with the advantages of the library. During the last year (1835) there were
        two thousand four hun dred and eighty-five readers in Dresden, and five hundred
        and twenty out of the city, making three thousand and five different readers
        for the year. The library at Goltingen has three hundred thousand volumes
        ; at Munich four hundred thousand ; at Berlin two hundred and fifty thousand
        ; at Vienna three hundred and fifty thousand, with numerous others. Every
        important town, in fact, has its library of a greater or less extent. The
        universities of Germany are also well attended. The most prominent are that
        of Berlin, with two thousand five hun- dred students, and that of Halle, with
        seven hundred. The uni- versity of Gottingen, also, in the Duchy of Brunswick,
        has nine hundred students ; and that of Leipsic in Saxony eight hundred and
        twenty. The German universities vary considerably at dif- ferent times in
        the number of their students, according to the celebrity of their professors.
        A popular lecturer, in any one de- partment, will draw students from the different
        sovereignties far and near, and thus, for the time, increase the patronage
        of the in- stitution. From the above specimens, it is evident that there are
        at this day very many who are pursuing a liberal and a profes- sional course
        of study in Germany. Many of these become, in their turn, professors, authors,
        and teachers of various grades. It is here, and here only, in many of the
        states, that the lower classes have a chance to rise. In the republic of letters
        the field is open for competition, and the rush to this theatre of action,
        and the press for distinction, is surprisingly great. Poverty is re- sisted,
        obstacles are overcome, and thousands are stretching on ward in their eager
        course for knowledge. The entire public', 1]

        church. Boxley House is distant from Maidstone about twro miles north-east,
        from Rochester seven miles, and from London 36 miles. Boxley, at the time
        of the survey of Domesday, belonged to Odo, Bishop of Baieux. On his disgrace
        it became forfeited to the Crown, and continued royal property till Richard
        I. in his first year, anno 1189, gave it to the Abbey of Boxley. The year
        after the dissolution of the abbey, Henry VIII. exchanged this manor with
        Sir Thomas Wyatt, of Allynton, for other lands, but it was soon afterwards
        vested again in the Crown, and again granted to Sir Thomas Wyatt, the son
        of the former gentleman, who forfeited it in consequence of his rebelling
        against Queen Mary ; but her Majesty was pleased to confer it, after his death,
        on his widow, Lady Jane, daughter of Sir William Haut, of Bourne. The last
        of this family, Richard Wiat, Esq. died without issue, in 1753, and by will
        gave this property to his relative, Robert, Lord Romney. Boxley Church, before
        the Reformation, had a rood, called the Mood of Grace, which was held in high
        estimation for its miraculous powers. It was broken to pieces, by the King''s
        command, at St. Paul''s Cross, London, on Sunday, Feb. 24th, 1538. Here are
        the following monuments : In the chancel, north side, a tablet for Ann, wife

        \ rise to a long and celebrated controversy. Mr. Boyle had obtained a MS.\

        \ called for the book sooner than was expected, Boyle took offence, and a\
        \ paper-war arose, which drew forth on both sides the most brilliant and spirited\
        \ exhibition of wit, criti cism, and erudition. A caricature appeared on the\
        \ occasion, representing Bentley about to be thrust into the brazen bull of\
        \ Phalaris, and exclaim ing, ' I had rather be roasted than Boyled.' When\
        \ Bentley was master of Trinity college, Cambridge, the fellows accused him\
        \ of embezzling the money of the society ; a charge which created the most\
        \ violent contentions, and which after twenty years duration, established\
        \ the innocence of the master. He also quarrelled with the university when,\
        \ as divinity professor, he refused to admit Middleton and others to the degree\
        \ of D.D. without a fee of sour guineas ; but on the matter being referred\
        \ to the king's bench, it was decided in Bentley's savour. On this occasion\
        \ Middleton behaved towards Bentley with great asperity, because he had termed\
        \ him ' fiddling Conyers,' in consequence of his great devotion to the violin.\

    - ["REGISTERS of BIRTHS, DEATHS, and MARRIAGES. 9 These three bodies, although\
        \ differing materially from each other in tenets and dis cipline, and having\
        \ distinct Boards for the management of their separate affairs, and for the\
        \ advancement of the interests of their several religious communities, have,\
        \ nevertheless, now for upwards of a century and a half, been characterized\
        \ under the general description of \" The Three Denominations.\" Some of the\
        \ earlier Registers of the Independents and Baptists, had their origin during\
        \ the troubles which occurred in the reign of Charles the First. But the Re\
        \ gisters of this early date are rare. After the passing of the Act of Uniformity,\
        \ on the Restoration of Charles the Second, when the great body of the Presbyterian\
        \ Clergy, and with them many of the other Clergy, who had embraced the tenets\
        \ of the Independents and Baptists, seceded from the Established Church, and\
        \ became the officiating Ministers of large Congregations, the Registers of\
        \ the \" Three Denominations\" increased in number and acquired importance\
        \ from the rank and wealth of some of the Non-conformist families. These Registers\
        \ were greatly mul tiplied after the Revolution of 1688, when the Toleration\
        \ Act gave a legal sanction to the worship of the Protestant Dissenters, and\
        \ for the first time, by a legal enact ment, recognized them as separate religious\
        \ communities in the State. The Registers of the Presbyterians and Independents\
        \ are Registers of Births and Baptisms, and in some instances of Deaths and\
        \ Burials. The entries of Births and Baptisms are made by the Minister who\
        \ officiated at the Baptism, and are generally attested by his signature.\
        \ In most of the Registers in which the signature is omitted in the separate\
        \ entry, there is a title or heading to the Book in the hand-writing of the\
        \ Minister, with his name affixed to it, indicating that the Baptisms therein\
        \ recorded were performed by him. These Registers seem, for the most part,\
        \ to have been accurately and faithfully kept. The Registers of the Baptists\
        \ are of a different character. From their peculiar tenets, such Registers\
        \ are Records, not of Baptisms, but merely of Births, for with them Baptism\
        \ is administered to those only who, having arrived at an age of understanding,\
        \ are desirous of being admitted to Church fellowship and communion. \u2014\
        \ As regards the Registers of Births, the general usage is, that, shortly\
        \ after the Birth of a child, the Minister of the Congregation to which the\
        \ parents belong, dedicates the child with prayer ; and thereupon, if a Register\
        \ is kept in the congre gation, he enters therein the name of the child and\
        \ the date of the Birth as then reported to him, adding, in some instances,\
        \ the date of Registration. In other cases the entry is signed by the parents,\
        \ or one of them, or by witnesses who were present at the Birth. All such\
        \ we have retained. There have been, however, a great number of Register Books\
        \ kept (especially within the last thirty years) on quite a different principle,\
        \ which are mere Certificates, not entered contemporaneously with the dedication\
        \ of the child, not attested by the signature of either of the parents, nor\
        \ of any witnesses present at the Birth, and not bearing any date when the\
        \ entry was made: these, we have felt ourselves compelled to reject, under\
        \ the conviction that, being devoid of any evidence, internal or otherwise,\
        \ to show by what authority or under what circumstances the entries have been\
        \ made, the keeping of them would answer no useful purpose, and we have, therefore,\
        \ returned them to the custody from which they came, to be there accessible\
        \ for all the domestic or local purposes, for which they have been heretofore\
        \ used. Register kept at Dr. Williams's Library, Red Cross-street. \u2014\
        \ (See Schedule H). In addition to the Registers transmitted to us from the\
        \ Dissenting Chapels of the Three Denominations, a Register of Births was\
        \ commenced in 1742 by the London Society of Lay Deputies, of the congregations\
        \ of the Protestant Dissenters of the Three Denominations in London and within\
        \ twelve miles of London. This Re gister was established at Dr. Williams's\
        \ Library in Red Cross-street, and con tinued till the close of the last year,\
        \ under the direction and supervision of the Deputies, the librarian of Dr.\
        \ Williams's Library always acting as registrar. A Statement of the method\
        \ in which this Register has been kept is appended to Schedule H. We have\
        \ visited and personally inspected this Registry, and can bear testimony to\
        \ the regularity of the entries, and the order in which they are kept. The\
        \ books contain nearly 50,000 entries of Births, together with the certificates\
        \ of the same. The Certificates may be divided into two classes, the earlier\
        \ series being signed by persons who were witnesses of the Birth, the latter\
        \ by the parents as well as such witnesses. We are of opinion that these Registers,\

        \ 147 Statement (to which the Report refers) of the method in which the General\
        \ Register at Dr. Williams' s Library has been kept. This Register has been\
        \ maintained under the supervision of the Committee of Deputies ; the Librarian\
        \ of the Library in Redcross Street, London, having, by the permission of\
        \ the Trustees of that Institution, always acted as Registrar. According to\
        \ the original plan of this Register, the parties produced to the Registrar\
        \ Duplicate Certificates on parchment, which have for the most part, with\
        \ some slight variations at different periods, been in the following form\
        \ : \u2014 No. These are to Certify, that of and his Wife, who was Daughter\
        \ of . was Born in in the Parish of in the County of this . . . . day of in\
        \ the Year at whose Birth we were present. Let this be Registered. The Midwife\
        \ and one or two other Persons present must sign this. The Registrar entered\
        \ the particulars contained in this Document in a tabular form in a book kept\
        \ by him, each entry corresponding in number with the number of the Certificate.\
        \ He then filed and preserved one of the original Certificates, and returned\
        \ the other, with his Cer- tificate of Registration, to the parties. He also\
        \ formed and kept an Alphabetical Index referring to the tabular record, and\
        \ thereby consequently to the original Certificate. To ensure the accuracy\
        \ and regularity of this scheme of registration the Deputies have been in\
        \ the habit of constantly, and for the most part yearly, nominating a Sub-committee,\
        \ who examined all the Documents, comparing the original Certificates with\
        \ the tabular records, and certifying the result of their examination from\
        \ time to time in the book. All these original Certificates (being 30,417\
        \ in number) are, with the trifling exception of about 13, now preserved most\
        \ carefully, and regularly arranged in boxes containing 1000 each, so that\
        \ any one of them can, from the earliest commencement of the series, be referred\
        \ to with- out the slightest difficulty. It appears that probably without\
        \ any close examination of the nature of this Institution, but from regard\
        \ to the regularity of its form and the high probability of its truth, it\
        \ was frequently admitted for legal purposes in courts of justice. About the\
        \ year 1826, however, the attention of the then Master of the Rolls having\
        \ been drawn to the real nature of the evidence thus produced, which rested\
        \ in fact on the mere voluntary declaration of witnesses who might or mio-ht\
        \ not be parents or relatives, he refused to receive it as legal evidence\
        \ of the facts it contained. The attention of the Deputies being thus attracted\
        \ to the subject, they advised with counsel of eminence, whose opinion was\
        \ in substance that there was no mode of placing the Register on the footino-\
        \ of Parochial Registers, that the Certificates taken as mere declarations\
        \ of witnesses would he inadmissible as evidence, but that Certificates signed\
        \ by the parents or one of them would be evidence as their declaration, and\
        \ admissible as such in courts of justice ; and moreover that they would be\
        \ entitled to more weight than the ordinary entry in a Bible, or other book\
        \ or paper, because the document was made more publicly and solemnly, and\
        \ in the presence of persons likely to detect or prevent fraud or inaccuracy.\
        \ It was then determined in some measure to remodel the Register, and a new\
        \ form was adopted for the Duplicate Certificates. These were thenceforth\
        \ printed on paper, and of such a uniform size that those retained by the\
        \ Registrar might (after being numbered consecutively) be bound in volumes.\
        \ This amended Certificate was in such a form as to make it at all events\
        \ amount to a direct and formal declaration of the parents, and receivable\
        \ as such in evidence on proof of their hand-writing ; and it moreover contained\
        \ the signatures of two witnesses, so as to afford every clue to direct testimony\
        \ to the fact of Birth, when such should be required. In lieu of the old books\
        \ containing the tabular arrangement of the contents of the Certifi- cates,\
        \ and the further book constituting the Alphabetical Index, the Deputies substituted\
        \ a more detailed index, in which were at once entered, alphabetically, the\
        \ leading contents of the Certi- ficate, referring to it by its number in\
        \ the volumes of Certificates. The Record has therefore thenceforth consisted\
        \ merely of two hooks, namely, the bound volumes of original Certificates\
        \ and the Alphabetical Index or Calendar referring thereto. Since the commencement\
        \ of the new system up to the 31st day of December, 1837, when the Registry\
        \ was closed by the direction of the before-mentioned body of Deputies, there\
        \ have been recorded 18,558 Births. U2", 1]

        humble station of life ; and on being threatened wth an apprentice ship that
        was not congenial to his feelings, he de clared that if his friends persisted,
        he would run away7 to sea ; but if they would but bring him up as a carpenter,
        he felt in that business he could work his way to something* better. His wishes
        were granted, and in the craft he had chosen he laboured for many years, and
        was for some time employed at Dock, now; Devonport, in very close service
        ; yet so great was. his desfre after knowledge, that, even at this period,
        he would read any book he could possibly get likely; to be useful to him;
        his opportunities, however, were few, but he never neglected his Bible, which
        he studied incessantly, not only as a religious, but as an historical guide
        of the highest interest and im portance. His health at length obliged him
        to quit Dock, and on his return to Tavistock he was employed as one of the

        them. What was their ultimate fate I never was able to ascertain." Our travellers
        at length arrived at Cape Town, and in September, 1822, Pringle commenced
        a residence there of nearly three years, the events of which were destined
        to be of no small importance both to himself and the colony. At this time
        the arrival of a commis sion of inquiry was expected, and Lord Charles was
        busily engaged in setting his house in order to receive them. Slavery was
        pronounced by authority to be an evil, and the dogma was promulgated that
        it was the duty of civilised men to remedy the defects of the system. Schools
        were to be established, and the En glish language and literature patronised
        ; the public library was countenanced by the public functionaries ; and there
        was even a whisper allowed to emanate from high places, that the Government
        Gazette was to be put into the hands of the new librarian, and rendered sub
        servient to the diffusion of useful knowledge throughout the colouy. The most
        remarkable triumph, however, of liberal principles that had ever been achieved
        at the Cape, was the execution of a man for the murder of another, although
        it was incontestably proved that the', 1]

        the direction of Dr. J. Kinnis, Staff Assistant Surgeon and Superintendent

        a part of his leisure to its study ; and to facilitate this end, keeps a number

        \ with froth : again she dashed herself on the ground, and her screams, though\
        \ smothered, were still audible. De Vere hung over her in anguish scarce inferior\
        \ to her own; his call for assistance brought the attendants, and with them\
        \ the physician, who had just left the chamber of death above. \"It is hopeless!\"\
        \ said he, in answer to Aubrey's frantic questions ; \" no skill on earth\
        \ could counteract a poison so deadly, and taken, too, in such quantity.\"\

        \ his arms to a sofa by the open window. The cool air seemed to soothe her,\
        \ and she lay for a few moments perfectly passive : the work of years had\
        \ been wrought upon her sunk and ghastly features. Slowly she raised her head,\
        \ and put back the thick tresses that pressed upon her brow ; she drank the\
        \ wine the doctor offered, and her re collection returned. ' \" You have been\

        Icon. Grec, At the beginning of this reign a rebellion had broken out at Lycopolis,
        in the Delta, which ended by that city being besieged and taken by the king''s
        troops ; and in the latter years of the reign, unless the historian has fallen
        into a mistake in the name of the city, Lycopolis was again the seat of civil
        war. At the head of the rebellion were Athinis, Posiris, Chesuphis, and Irobashtus,
        whose Coptic names clearly prove that it was a struggle on the part of the
        Egyptians to throw off the Greek yoke. But they could not long hold out against
        Polycrates at the head of the Greek merce naries, and, yielding to the greater
        force of the besiegers, and to the king''s promises of pardon, they came out
        of their stronghold, and were brought to the king at Sais. Epiphanes, in whose
        heart were joined the cruelty and the cowardice of a tyrant, who had not even
        shown himself to the army during the siege, was now eager to act the conqueror
        ; and in spite of the promises of safety on which these brave Copts had laid
        down their arms, he had them tied to his chariot wheels, and, copying the
        vices of men whose virtues he could not even understand, like Achilles and
        Alexander, he dragged them living round the city walls, and then ordered them
        to be put to death. Apollonius, whom we have spoken of in the reign of Euergetes,
        and who had been teaching at Rhodes during the reign of Philo pator, was recalled
        to Alexandria in the beginning of this reign, and made librarian of the Museum.
        The coins of this king are known by the glory or rays of sun which surround
        his head, and which agrees with his name Epi phanes, '' illustrious,'' or
        as it is written in the hieroglyphics '' light bearing.'' On the other side
        is the cornucopia between two stars, with the words BA2IAE&5 nTOAEMAIOT, ''

        which, from their praise of freedom and hatred of tyrants, few persons would
        even speak of in the pre sence of a king. But Demetrius had also been consulted
        by Soter about the choice of a successor, and had given his opinion that the
        crown ought to be left to his eldest son, and that wars would arise between
        his chil dren if it were not so left ; hence we can hardly wonder that, on
        the death of Soter, Demetrius should have been ordered to leave Alexandria.
        Soon after this, we find Zenodotus of Ephesus filling the office of librarian
        to the Museum. He was a poet, who, with others, had been employed by Soter
        in the education of his children. He was also a critic, and is known as the
        first who turned his thoughts towards mending the text of Homer, which had
        become faulty through the carelessness of the copiers. At the head of the
        mathematical school was Euclid, who is, how ever, less known to us by what
        his pupils have said of him than by his own work, which is one of the few
        of the scientific writings of the ancients which have come down to us. The
        discoveries of the man of science are made use of by his successor, and the
        disco verer perhaps loses part of his reward when his writings are passed
        by, after they have served us as a stepping-stone to mount by. If he wishes
        his works to live with those of the poet and orator, he must, like them, cultivate
        those beauties of style which are fitted to his matter. Euclid did so : and
        the Elements have been for more than two thousand years the model for all
        writers on geometry. He begins at the beginning, and leads the learner, step
        by step, from the simplest propositions, called axioms, which rest upon meta
        physical rather than mathematical proof, to high geometrical truths. The mind

        golden fleece. It is a regular epic poem, in imitation of Homer, and, like
        other imitations, it wants the interest which hangs upon reality of manners
        and story in the Iliad. Aristophanes, and his pupil Aristarchus, the great
        critics of the day, with whose judgement few dared to differ, and who had
        perhaps quarrelled with the poet, declared that it was not poetry ; and after
        that, the most that Quintilian would say for it was, that it ought not to
        be overlooked, for it never falls below mediocrity. His master Callimachus
        showed his dislike of his young rival by hurling against him a reproachful
        poem, in which he speaks of him under the name of an Ibis. This is now lost,
        but it was copied by Ovid in his poem of the same name ; and from the Roman
        we can gather something of the dark and learned style in which Callima chus
        threw out his biting reproaches. We do not know from what this quarrel arose,
        but it seems to have been the cause of Apollo nius leaving Alexandria. He
        removed to Rhodes, where he taught eloquence during all the reign of Philopator,
        till he was recalled by Epiphanes, and made librarian of the Museum in his
        old age, on the death of Eratosthenes. Many of the old philosophers were fond
        of clothing wisdom in the dress of proverbs, or short sentences ; and one
        by Apollonius has been handed down to us, which, though prettily worded, we
        must fear was meant ill-naturedly. He said that '' nothing dries sooner than
        a tear.'' Lycophron, the tragic writer, lived about this time at Alexandria,
        and was one of the seven men of letters sometimes called the Alex andrian
        Pleiades, though writers are not agreed upon the names which fill up the list.
        His tragedies are all lost, and the only work of his which we now have is
        the dark and muddy poem of Alcandra,', 1]

        some were young students, and others the savans of France, sitting in silence
        at long tables, surrounded by piles of moth-eaten folios and quartos, reading
        and writing at their leisure. The same arrangements I afterwards noticed elsewhere,
        and I was told, that I might have witnessed them in all the public libraries
        of Paris, a policy as wise as it is liberal, and truly worthy of a great and
        enlightened nation. One large room in the King''s Library is devoted to ancient
        coins and medals, of which there is a vast collection, and many of which are
        extremely rare and curious. I was much struck with some of the old en gravings
        which were shown us upon precious stones, as exhibiting a delicacy, finish,
        and skill not easily surpassed by modern artists of the highest pretensions.
        The Hall of Globes, also, is well worth the travel ler''s attention. The two
        globes, (celestial and ter restial,) if you have never heard of their dimensions
        before you enter the room, strike you with astonish ment. They are full twelve
        feet in diameter. They are mounted upon bronze pillars of elegant workman

        above the floor. No one can for the first time stand and look up, and see
        these spheres revolve, without a kind of awe which such an exhibition would
        hardly be expected to excite. But the Hall of the Zodiac is still more interest
        ing and curious. The most prominent object here is the celebrated sculptured
        Zodiac which was detached from the ceiling of the temple of Denderah, with
        im mense labor, and brought to Paris in 1821. It was discovered by the scientific

        salubrity of Colombo, when it is recollected that most of them have been exposed
        to the influ ence of its climate for seven years. Passing a thick wall, we
        came upon a green esplanade, the mar gins of which, on two sides, are planted
        with shade trees. Near this parade ground stands a pile, built in the Dutch
        style, called the " King''s House," which is the residence of the governor.
        Part of the edifice was being repaired. Not long since, the whole tile roof
        of the main building slid off, and exposed the palm-leaf thatching. Un der
        a lofty portico an English sentinel was pacing back and forth, and within
        the threshold a porter, in a most theatrical garb, met us, and announced our
        names. In a few minutes His Excellency re ceived us, in a most hospitably
        courteous manner, in a long hall that opened upon a fine corridor, or, as
        it is termed in the east, veranda, that looks upon a garden at the back of
        the house, which is almost hidden on all sides by trees of beautiful foliage.
        After the interview, which impressed us very favourably of the governor, I
        visited the Colombo library, which contains about ten thousand volumes, ranged
        in a long airy hall, furnished with chairs, sofas, and tables, upon which
        may be seen the best daily journals and the leading periodicals of England
        and India. It is freely open to strangers, and the librarian is ever ready
        to wait upon the vi siters. Captain Steuart had procured for me an invitation
        to witness a battle between a mangouste and a cobra di capello, among the
        most poisonous serpents of India, at the house and under the di rection of
        Dr. J. Kinnis, Staff Assistant Surgeon and Superinten dent of Vaccination
        in the Colombo district. At the appointed hour I was kindly welcomed by the
        doctor, and was introduced to several ladies and officers of H. B. M. Army.
        Dr. Kinnis is a lo ver of natural history, and devotes a part of his leisure
        to its study; and to facilitate this end, keeps a number of living animals
        in his house, which, with a collection of drawings relating to the science,
        were exhibited in turn. My attention was first directed to two co bras of
        small size, not more than a foot long, placed separately on plates, with glasses
        turned over them, and two others of the maxi mum size were together in a wooden
        case with a glass door. These were destined to contribute to the sports of
        the day. In the back part ofthe house we saw two mangoustes, one half grown,

        ventured to explore the riches ofthe vacant tents; but, if we except some
        celebrated relics, a small portion of the spoil was restored to the innocent

        had been crushed by the hammer of Charles 32, while no more than fifteen hundred
        Christians were slain in the field of Tours. But this in credible tale is
        sufficiently disproved by the caution ofthe French general, who apprehended
        the snares and accidents of a pursuit, and dismissed his German allies to
        their native forests. The in activity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength
        and blood, and the most cruel execution is inflicted, not in the ranks of
        battle, but on the backs of a flying enemy. Yet the victory of the Franks
        was complete and final ; Aquitain was recovered by the arms of Eudes ; the

        \ is called ST. LEONARD'S PLACE. This street was thrown open for carriages,\
        \ May 1st, 1835, and is indebted for its name to the circumstance of St. Leonard's\
        \ Hospital having formerly extended over the principal part of it. At the\

        \ whom this library belongs, was established in 1794, and formerly occupied\
        \ premises in St. Helen's-square. In 1836, however, they removed to St. Leonard's-place,\
        \ where they now are tenants to the corporation. The members, which at present\

        \ and con cisely as possible. In the year 6'26, Edwin, the Saxon king of Northumberland,\
        \ whose residence was in this city, became a convert to Christianity, under\
        \ the teaching of Paulinus, a priest sent from the Court of Rome ; but the\
        \ city was then reduced to so low a condition, as not to furnish a temple\
        \ suitable for performing the ceremony of baptism. A small oratory of wood\
        \ was therefore erected for the occasion, on the site of the present Minster,\
        \ and dedicated to St. Peter, in which the king and his two sons were baptized\
        \ on Easter-day, 627. Paulinus, afterwards archbishop of York, by order of\
        \ Edwin, laid the foundation of a large stone building, including the wooden\
        \ church, which was not completed, the prelate having to leave England, in\
        \ consequence of king Edwin being killed in battle at Hatfield Chase, in Yorkshire.\
        \ Oswald, who was afterwards king, commenced its completion in 632, but it\
        \ nearly became a prey to Penda,the Pagan king of Mercia, who conquered and\
        \ slew Oswald. The Cathedral, then erected with stone, was a square building,\
        \ dedicated to St. Peter, the feasl of which dedication was annually held\
        \ in the Minster, on the 1st of October and seven days after. Wilfred was\
        \ the next archbishop, and in 669 he repaired the walls, and renewed the roof,\
        \ which he covered with lead. During his occupancy of the see, the noble library\
        \ of archbishop Egbert, who had appointed the learned Alcuin his librarian,\
        \ was added, which must at that time have been a most valuable treasure. The\
        \ famous Alcuin has been considered by some a native of Ibis city ; it is\
        \ certain, however, that he was educated here, and was perhaps the most extraordinary\
        \ instance of learning and piety of any who flourished in so early an age.\
        \ In 741, the Cathedral suffered much by fire, and it was afterwards rebuilt\
        \ by archbishop Albert, a learned native, (who was promoted to the see in\

        sustained effort of his muse, which gave Mr. Becket place and consideration
        among the poets of his time. It was printed in quarto, uniform with the first
        editions of Goldsmith''s " Traveller " and " Deserted Village ;" and the reception
        it met with from the public was suffi cient to encourage the author to travel
        boldly upward in the steep ascent to fame. In addition to the distinguished
        individuals already mentioned, as frequent guests at his father''s, was Sir
        John M''Pherson,* who was a professed admirer and patron of literature, and
        paid Mr. Becket some high compliments on his talents. Previously to his appointment
        as assistant librarian to Dr. Clark, at Carlton House, Mr. Becket obtained,
        under the patronage of Fox and Sheridan, a situation, of small emolument,
        in the Secretary of State''s office ;f but which was lost at the change of
        administration, when Lord North succeeding, brought into office with him numerous
        followers, among whom was the father of the celebrated Mr. Brummel. A favourable
        opportunity now offered of visiting the continent, of which Mr. Becket gladly
        availed him self, and being entrusted with a commission to Dr. Maclean, minister
        of the English Church at the Hague, he embarked in a Dutch trader, and landing
        safely in Holland, made a tour of some duration in the United * M''Pherson,
        the translator of Ossian, was another of his friends. f In 1782, Mr. Becket
        obtained another situation of similar emolu ment in Somerset-House, from which,
        after forty years'' service, he retired on a small pension in 1822.', 1]

        \ the world soon saw that a body of lux urious mercenaries were as little\

        \ who had been the pupil of Zeno. One day, when Sph\xE6rus was dining with\
        \ the king, he said that a wise man should never guess, but only say what\
        \ he knows. Philopator, wishing to teaze him, ordered some waxen pomegranates\

        \ buried there in former ages, and these had been brought forward by the Christians\
        \ in reproach against the pagans as so many proofs of human sacrifices. Diodorus\

        \ Egyptians, as being an offence against his religion. For this he was attacked\
        \ and killed, with George and Dracontius. The mob carried the bodies of the\

        But Demetrius had also been consulted by Soter about the choice of a suc cessor,
        and had given his opinion that the croAvn ought to be left to his eldest son,
        and that M''ars would arise between his children if it were not so left ;
        hence M''e can hardly wonder that, on the death of Soter, Deme trius should
        ha\re lost his place at the head of the Museum, and been ordered to leave
        Alexandria. Soon after this we find Zenodotus of Ephesus filling the office
        of librarian to the Museum. He was a poet, who, with others, had been employed
        by Soter in the education of his children. He Avas also a critic, and is known
        as the first of those Alexandrian critics who turned their thoughts towards
        mending the text of Homer, which had become faulty through the care lessness
        of the copiers, and to whom we are indebted for the tolerably correct state
        of the text of the great poet. Zenodotus was soon followed by other critics
        in this task of editing Homer. But their labours were not approved of by all
        ; and AA''hen Aratus asked Timon which he thought the best edition of the
        poet, the philosopher shrewdly ansAvered, ''That which has been '' least corrected.''

        known to us by Avhat his pupils have said of him than by his OAvn work, which
        is one of the few of the scientific writings of the ancients which have come
        down to us. The discoveries of the man of science are made use of by his successor,
        and the discoverer perhaps loses part of his reward when his writings are
        passed by, after they have served us as a stepping-stone to mount by. If he
        wishes his works to live with those of the poet and orator, he must, like
        them, cultivate those beauties of style which are fitted to his matter. Euclid

        \ but are unfortunately lost. To the north, Alexander pushed beyond the Jaxartes,\
        \ but without being able to bring under subjection the rude tribes who tenanted\
        \ those regions. On the side of India, he learned the existence of the Ganges\
        \ and the fine coun tries on its banks, to which he eagerly sought to penetrate;\
        \ but the mutiny of his troops compelled him to stop at the Hyphasis. The\
        \ Greeks had then an opportunity of observing some of the pecu liarities of\
        \ the Indian people ; their division into castes ; their fantastical religious\
        \ austerities ; and the merit attached to suicide. Alexander de scended the\
        \ Indus to its mouth, and sent thence a licet under Nearchus,who traced the\
        \ coast of Asia as far as the Persian Gulph, which he ascended, and joined\
        \ his master at Babylon. This voyage, now so easy, was then considered a most\
        \ perilous achievement, and the party arrived in a state of distress and exhaustion.\
        \ Alexander himself, in returning through the maritime provinces, be came\
        \ aware of their extremely desolate charac ter, through which, indeed, his\
        \ army was in danger of perishing. On the partition of Alexander's empire,\
        \ Seleucus obtained Syria, with as much of the countries to the eastward as\
        \ his arms could hold in subjection. He is said to have attempted the conquest\
        \ of India; but there is no dis tinct account how far he penetrated ; proba\
        \ bly it was not beyond Alexander's limit. He sent however an embassy, under\
        \ Megasthenes, to Palibothra (Pataliputra) on the Ganges, capital of one of\
        \ the most powerful kingdoms ever formed in India; and through this channel\
        \ a good deal of additional information was obtained. He also employed his\
        \ admiral, Patroclus, in an at tempt to circumnavigate Asia ; and rumour even\
        \ represents him as having accomplished this vast circuit, and entered from\
        \ the northern ocean into the Caspian ; but the manifestly fabulous character\
        \ of this report makes it impossible to conjecture howr far he really penetrated.\
        \ All the materials thus collected were at the disposal of Eratosthenes, the\
        \ learned librarian of Alexandria ; and were employed by him in forming, on\
        \ the astronomical principles of Hip parchus, the first systematic delineation\
        \ of the globe. It is however, as to Asia, extremely im perfect. The Ganges\
        \ is made to fall into the eastern ocean, represented as bounding the habitable\
        \ earth. The Cape of the Coliaci (Comorin) is made at once the most southerly\
        \ and most easterly point of Asia. About ten degrees north of the Ganges,\
        \ and a very little east, is placed, in the same ocean, the city of Thin\xE6\
        , often alluded to as the extremity on that side of the habitable world :\
        \ this appears the first very imperfect rumour, which reached the western\
        \ nations of the Chinese empire. Not far from Thin\xE6, the coast turned westward,\
        \ stretching along the great northern ocean, which bounds both Europe and\
        \ Asia, but at so low a latitude that the Caspian was considered to be a gulph\
        \ connected with it by a narrow strait. This was a retrograde step even from\
        \ Herodotus, who had described it justly as an inland sea. Asia, thus wanting\
        \ 'libet, China, the greater part of Tartary, and all Siberia, possessed little\
        \ above a third part of its real dimensions. $ The Romans did not, by their\
        \ conquests, obtain any accession to the knowledge of Asia. Before they reached\
        \ Persia, that country had been occupied by the Parthians, a brave VI. Progress\
        \ of Discovert. \u2014 Thegeographi cal knowledge of Asia may be considered\
        \ as com mencing with its western countries, and with Greece, the cradle of\
        \ our present civilisation. Judea and Ph\u0153nicia are the quarters from\
        \ which the earliest information comes. The Jews scarcely recognised distinctly\
        \ any object more easterly than the Euphrates, emphati cally termed by them\
        \ \" the river ;\" beyond which, at a vague and uncertain distance, they placed\
        \ \" the ends of the earth.\" Tyie traded with several cities on its banks,\
        \ but does not seem to have pushed her intercourse further; though Dr. Vincent\
        \ reasonably conjectures, that the chests of rich apparel, carefully bound\
        \ with cords, brought by this channel, were from countries much more remote.\
        \ A great traffic is mentioned with Dedan, a city of Arabia, which, from its\
        \ many isles, and its merchandise of precious cloths, must have been in the\
        \ vicinity of Ormuz, and have drawn these commodities from India. They were\
        \ transported, by large caravans, across Arabia to Edom or Idumea, which was\
        \ greatly enriched by this traffic. From the south of Arabia, Sheba, or Sabea,\
        \ sent caravans laden with gold and incense, both probably obtained from the\
        \ opposite coasts of Africa. The knowledge of the Greeks, in the nearly cotemporary\
        \ age of Homer, was far more limited. He seems to have had no distinct knowledge\
        \ of any country east of Asia Minor. Colchos, on the Euxine, being supposed\
        \ to contain the chariot of the sun, must have been viewed as the eastern\
        \ extremity of the earth : the voyage thither by Jason, in the ship Argo,\
        \ was regarded as an almost superhuman achievement. The name Asia was then\
        \ applied only to a part ofthe coast of Caria, whence it was extended to the\
        \ peninsula, and ultimately to the whole continent ; after which the other\
        \ was named the Lesser Asia.* The triumphant contest of Greece with Per sia\
        \ excited deep interest, and generated plans of conquest, which rendered every\
        \ information respecting that empire acceptable. The most valuable contributor\
        \ was Herodotus, who, during a residence at Babylon, collected materials for\
        \ a description of the satrapies into which it was di vided. To the north\
        \ it extended over a part of the Caucasian provinces, enabling the writer\
        \ to delineate tolerably the extent and boundaries of the Caspian. Margiana\
        \ and Bactria probably reached to the Oxus, beyond which wandered the Scythian\
        \ tribe named Massaget\xE6. India was the most easterly satrapy ; but being\
        \ described as containing no great river except the Indus, and bounded by\
        \ an immense desert, it evidently contained only the western provinces, while\
        \ the Gangetic and southern countries were entirely unknown. Herodotus gives\
        \ a somewhat rude description of the inhabitants, suggested probably by the\
        \ bordering mountaineer tribes. The fact of its affording a revenue four times\
        \ that of Egypt, shows clearly that il was already opulent and improved. Darius\
        \ is said to have employed Scylax, the Caryandrian, to descend thelndus, sail\
        \ along the southern coast, and come up the Red Sea ; a voyage accomplished\
        \ in two years, t The next great source of information to the Greeks was the\
        \ expedition of Alexander. It did not, indeed, extend much beyond the al ready\
        \ known limits of the Persian empire ; but the countries, before known only\

        \ this manner that we are to explain the disparaging sentiment connected by\
        \ Horace and others with the idea of a cyclic writer, though no such sentiment\
        \ was implied in the original meaning of the Epic Cycle. The poems of the\

        \ 1 The gradual growth of a contemptuous feeling towards the scriptor cyclicus\
        \ (Horat. Ars Poetic. 136), which was not originally implied in the name,\
        \ is well set forth by Lange (Ueber die Kyklisch. Dicht. p. 53-56). Both Lange\
        \ (p. 36-41) however and Ulrici (Geschichte des Griech. Epos, 9te Vorles.\
        \ p. 418) adopt another opinion with respect to the cycle, which I think unsupported\
        \ and inadmissible, \u2014 that the several constituent poems were not received\
        \ into it entire (t. e. with only such changes as were requisite for a corrected\
        \ text), but cut down and abridged in such manner as to produce an exact continuity\
        \ of narrative. Lange even imagines that the cyclic Odyssey was thus dealt\
        \ with. But there seems no evidence to countenance this theory, which would\
        \ con vert the Alexandrine literati from critics into logographers : that\
        \ the cyclic Iliad and Odyssey were the same in the main (allowing for cor\
        \ rections of text) as the common Iliad and Odyssey, is shown by the fact,\
        \ that Proclus merely names them in the series without giving any abstract\
        \ of their contents : they were too well known to render such a process necessary.\
        \ Nor does either the language of Proclus, or that of C\xE6cius as applied\
        \ to Zenodotus, indicate any transformation applied to the poets whose works\
        \ are described to have been brought together and put into a certain order.\
        \ The hypothesis of Lange is founded upon the idea that the (aKoXovSla irpayparcov)\

        \ by changing a few names, and substituting plumes for bonnets, bayonets for\
        \ spears, &c. \" Be that as it may, the Indians on this occasion were again\
        \ broken, routed, and forced to jump into the river. Many were killed on the\
        \ bank, and many more in the stream. Our aged friend Cornplanter, chief of\
        \ the Se necas, a young man, saved himself by swimming, as did several others.\

        \ his rifle, \u2014 an Indian, exasperated at the unexpected defeat, and disgraceful\
        \ retreat of his paity, and supposing himself now safe from the well known\
        \ and abhorred enemy of his race, commenced a species ofconversation with\
        \ him in broken English, which we call blackguarding \u2014 calling Brady\

        \ in such attitudes as he probably thought would be most ex pressive of his\
        \ utter contempt of them. When the main army arrived, a canoe was manned,\
        \ and Brady and a few men crossed to where the Indian had been seen. They\
        \ found blood on the ground, and had fol lowed it but a short distance till\
        \ the Indian jumped up, struck his breast, and said, ' I am a man.' It was\
        \ Brady's wish to take him prisoner, without doing him further harm. The Indian\
        \ continuing to repeat, ' I am a man,' \u2014 ' Yes,' said an Irishman who\
        \ was along, \u2014 ' Be my sowl, you're a purty boy,' \u2014 and before Brady\

        \ to pay to the visions of the night. large army of Highlanders and lslesmen.\
        \ He was encoun \u2022 tered at Harlaw, in the Garioch, by Alexander, Earl\
        \ of Mar, at the head of the northern nobility and gentry of Saxon and Norman\
        \ descent. The battle was bloody and indecisive ; but the invader was obliged\
        \ to retire, in conse quence ofthe loss he sustained, and afterwards was com\
        \ pelled to make submission to the Regent, and renounce his pretensions to\
        \ Ross ; so that all the advantages of the field were gained by the Saxons.\

        \ the same kind of check, may have occasioned the Antiquary's par t-ality.\

        \ death is taken from an incident said to have happened at the funeral of\
        \ John, Duke of Roxburghe. All who were acquainted with that accomplishednobleman\
        \ must remember, ihat he was not more remarkable for creating and possessing\
        \ a most curious and splendid library, than for his acquaintance with the\
        \ literary treasures it contained. In arranging his books, fetching and replacing\
        \ the volumes which be wanted, and carrying on all the necessary intercourse\
        \ which a man of letters holds with his library, it was the Duke's custom\
        \ to employ, not a secretary or librarian, but a livery servant, calledArchie,\
        \ whom habit had made so perfectly acquainted with the library, that he knew\
        \ every book, as a shepherd does the individuals of his flock by what is sailed\

        \ all the mechanical aid the Duke required in his lite rary researches. To\
        \ secure the attendance of Archie, there was a bell hung in his room, which\
        \ was used on no occasion except to call him individually to the Duke's study.\
        \ His Grace died in Saint James's Square, London, in the year 1804 ; the body\
        \ was to be conveyed to Scotland, to lie in state at his mansion of Fleurs,\
        \ and to be removed from thence to the family burial-place at Bowden. At this\
        \ time, Archie, who had been long attacked by a liver complaint, was in the\
        \ very last stage of that disease. Yet he prepared himself to accompany the\
        \ body of the master whom he had so long and so faithfully waited upon. \"\

        \ of which, all the fishers, who were enrolled as sea-fencibles, got on board\
        \ the gun-boats, w'hich they were to man as occasion should require, and sailed\
        \ to oppose the supposed enemy. The foreigners proved to be Russians, with\
        \ whom we were then at peace. The county gentlemen of Mid-Lothian, pleased\
        \ with the zeal displayed by the sea-fencibles at a critical moment, passed\
        \ a vote for presenting the community of fishers with a silver punch-bowl,\
        \ to be used on occasions of festivity. But the fisher-women, on hearing what\
        \ was intended, put in their claim to have some separate share in the intended\
        \ honorary reward. The men, they said, were their hus-, bands ; it w^as they\
        \ who would have been sufferers if their husbands had been killed, and it\
        \ was by their permission and injunctjpns that they embarked on board the\
        \ gun-boats for the put>lit; service. They therefore claimed to share the\
        \ reward in some manner which should distinguish the female patriotism which\
        \ they had shown on the occasion. The gentlemen of the county willingly admitted\
        \ the claim ; and, without diminishing the value of their compliment to the\
        \ men, they made the females a present of a valuable brooch, to fasten the\
        \ plaid of the queen of the fisher-wo men for the time. Note H, p. 145, \u2014\
        \ Alarm of Invasion. The story of the false alarm at Fairport, and the conse\
        \ quences, are taken from a real incident. Those who wit nessed the state\
        \ of Britain, and of Scotland in particular, from the period that succeeded\
        \ the war which commenced in 1803 to the battle of Trafalgar, must recollect\
        \ those times with feelings which we can hardly hope to make the rising generation\
        \ comprehend. Almost every individual was enrolled either in a military or\
        \ civil capacity, for the purpose of contributing to resist the long-suspended\
        \ threats of invasion, which were echoed from every quarter. Bea cons were\
        \ erected along the coast, and all through the country, to give the signal\
        \ for every one to repair to the post where his peculiar duty called him,\
        \ and men of every description fit to serve held themselves in readiness on\
        \ the shortest summons. During this agitating period, and on the evening of\
        \ the 2d February 1804, the person who kept watch on the commanding station\
        \ of Home Castle, being deceived by some accidental fire in the county of\
        \ Northum berland, which he took for the corresponding signal-light in that\
        \ county with which his orders were to communi cate, lighted up his own beacon.\
        \ The signal was imme diately repeated through all the valleys on the English\
        \ Border. If the beacon at Saint Abb's head had been tired, the alarm would\
        \ have run northward, and roused all Scot land. But the watch at this important\
        \ point judiciously considered, that if there had been an actual or threatened\
        \ descent on our eastern sea-coast, the alarm would have come along the coast,\
        \ and not from the interior of the country. Through the Border counties the\
        \ alarm spread with ra pidity, and on no occasion when that country was the\
        \ scene of perpetual and unceasing war, was the summons to arms It may be\
        \ farther remarked, that these Nereids are punc tilious among themselves,\

        \ such as best suited his taste and habits. Charles Hazlewood held a distinguished\

        \ and ap probation of his parents; for there was no knowing, they thought,\
        \ what assiduous attention might pro duce, and the beautiful Miss Mannering,\
        \ of high family, with an Indian fortune, was a prize worth looktog after.\

        \ on earth to recommend her, but a pretty face, good birth, and a most amiable\
        \ disposition. Mannering was more prudent. He considered himself acting as\
        \ Miss Bertram's guardian, and, while he did not think it incumbent upon him\

        \ one thousand two hundred and eighty-nine,1 on the sixth teenth May, and\

        \ little treatise, to give an account of the catastrophe, that accidents of\
        \ a similar nature may be avoided through this calamity allotted to us. On\
        \ the day above mentioned, which was very destructive to us, a vile plumber,\
        \ with his two workmen, burnt our church whilst soldering up two holes in\
        \ the old lead with fresh pewter. For some days he had already, with a wicked\
        \ disposition, commenced, and placed his iron crucibles, along with charcoal\
        \ and fire, on rubbish, or steps of a great height, upon dry wood, with some\
        \ turf and other combustibles. About noon (in the cross, in the body of the\
        \ church, where he remained at his work till after mass) he descended before\
        \ the pro cession of the convent, thinking that the fire had been put out\
        \ by his workmen. They, however, came down quickly after him, without having\
        \ completely extinguished the fire ; and the fire among the charcoal revived,\
        \ and partly from the heat of the iron, and partly from the sparks of the\
        \ charcoal, the fire spread itself to the wood and other combustibles beneath.\
        \ After the fire was thus commenced, the lead melted, and the joists upon\
        \ the beams ignited ; and then the fire increased prodigiously, and con sumed\
        \ every thing. In compensation for such a loss and excessive destruction,\

        \ The more standard serials \u2014 such as the Quarterly, Edinburgh, Blackwood,\
        \ &c. \u2014 have not yet reached our remote locality. On the whole, Gisborough,\
        \ although not essentially or peculiarly intellectual beyond its neighbours,\
        \ contains a fair average of individuals attached to literature and general\
        \ reading. In the stir of active and necessary occupation we cannot expect\
        \ an array of literary martyrs and self-devoted enthusiasts ; such a state\
        \ of affairs would neither benefit in wisdom nor purse : all that can be demanded\
        \ is due appreciation of literary labour, the desire of self-improvement,\
        \ a generous sympathy with productions of genius, and a determination to be\
        \ on a level with the intellectual standard of the age. Mawkish intolerance,\
        \ selfish bigotry (the spawn of ignorance), vulgar assumption, political inso\

        \ here before they fade even from tradition. Every child yet believes in the\
        \ story of the subterraneous passage running from the Priory to Plantation-field\
        \ in Toccotes. Midway in this dismal pathway is an enor mous chest of gold,\
        \ guarded by a raven or crow, who keeps incessant watch over the precious\
        \ contents. Once only was the treasure invaded, by a person who hoped to appropriate\
        \ some of the ingots ; but when he had reached the box, its guardian, the\
        \ raven, suddenly became transformed into his Satanic Majesty, who belaboured\
        \ the intruder with such terrible severity, and otherwise excited such a dreadful\
        \ fright, that neither he nor any other person ever ventured within the precincts\
        \ afterwards. Be this as it may, a subterraneous passage unquestionably existed,\
        \ commencing in the ancient part of the ruin now occupied as a wine-vault\
        \ ; but the mason who discovered it, Thomas Winter, was ordered by the late\
        \ Mr. Chaloner again to close it up. The use and object of such a passage\
        \ we must, of course, leave to conjecture. Doubtless it might reveal many\

        \ and the fierce rage of crusading zeal, and the barbarous manners and occupations\
        \ of savage times, still maintained in due estimation the noble writings of\

        \ immortal remains of the poets, philosophers, and historians of Greece and\
        \ Rome. These men \u2014 men of pure and lofty intellect, such as Cedmon,\

        \ and money to a certain number of poor persons in the parish. The annual\
        \ amount is paid to the churchwardens, who distribute bread and money to twelve\
        \ poor widows and other deserving persons. The Chapel is finished and furnished\
        \ in the most elegant style conceivable; the roof arched, subdivided into\
        \ compartments, and supported by graceful Ionic columns. From the centre hangs\
        \ suspended a handsome gilded chandelier, and a splendid painted window casts\
        \ its gorgeous hues of violet and gold over the altar. This picture, highly\
        \ esteemed by connoisseurs, represents the offerings of the Magi at the birth\

        You may also have heard the anecdote I am about to relate, but this gen tleman
        may not ; and I think I remember 3''ou declaring that the repetition of a
        tale in favour of anyone gives you as great pleasure as the first hearing.
        is not inactive) many other things characteristic of our lamented sovran.
        But humour and faee tiousness are the appurtenances of a light heart rather
        than of a kind one, and rebound for the greater part from something hard about
        us. We look for them however when much better things are before us ; as we
        turn our attention from fields of ripe corn and rich pasturage, sustainers
        of life and comfort, to any sparkling mineral. Did not you, M. Landor, reside
        one summer at the Villa Catani, just behind Poggio Imperiale? Landor. I did.
        The distance is so short and the situation so elevated, I could see the family
        from my terrace, and hear the music ; to which I always listened in the evening.
        For music has another effect when it comes from a family no less in concord
        : and it is delightful to think that those who govern us, taste in common
        our purer de lights. Such are the sources of happiness to these good people
        ! Do any such rise from the fields of Austeriitz and Jena ? English Visiter.
        That is curious. Landor. My reason is this ; there is the proof that a good
        action is not forgotten at once. Tell the story, if you please, for I know
        not what it may be. Florentine Visiter. Nicolini, our dramatic writer, no
        less enthusiastic in his politics than in his poetry, was librarian to the
        Granduke. He requested his discharge. " Why so, Nicolini ? " said Ferdinand.
        " Highness ! my sentiments are adverse to the occupation," answered he. The
        Granduke was surprised, but knowing that Nico lini was an irreproachable man,
        and that nothing was remoter from his character than ingratitude, he replied,
        " Well, Nicolini, if you insist on your discharge, you must have it. I have
        nothing to say when your conscience and feelings will not permit you to retain
        the office." Within four or five days his younger brother was promoted to
        the rank of captain ; and going to court on the occa sion, the Granduke asked
        him very particularly how the elder did, without the slightest reference to
        what had passed, and mentioned him as one whose talents do honour to his family
        and his country. Soon afterward a new place was created for the republican,
        more congenial to him ; that of lecturer to the Academy of Painting and Sculpture.
        Florentine Visiter. Excuse me ; you must have heard about the mason. English
        Visiter. What is that ? Florentine Visiter. The Granduke was much occupied
        in building, and was often out of doors among the labourers. He was watching
        them one day (for masons of all workmen want watching the most) when a bucketful
        of rubbish was thrown down, and covered him from head to foot. Some thing
        of pain was added to his surprise, and, utter ing one exclamation, he walked
        toward the palace door on the side of the garden. The labourer heard a voice
        ; and looking down, and seeing a hat on the ground covered with mortar, he
        de scended the ladder from curiosity. Turning his body from it, the first
        object he beheld was the Granduke, standing against the wall under the scaffold,
        and wiping his shoulder. The labourer threw himself on his knees . . implored
        forgive ness . . prayed the Virgin to soften his heart . . could never have
        supposed that his Highness was below . . "It is well it was I," replied the
        good man in the midst of this, and still wiping his shoulder and his sleeves
        ; "say nothing about it." For he knew that, if it had happened to a prime
        minister or a prime menial, the poor creature of a mason would have been dismissed.
        And per haps he suspected it might happen : for, some da3''s afterward he
        asked " how many were at work ;" and, (when it was told him) " whether the
        same number had been there constantly." Landor. Inquisitive man ! how he idled
        and trifled ! and at a time too when the first princes and opera-dancers in
        the world were at the Con gress of Verona, fixing the fate of nations ! In
        this manner did Ferdinand treat his subjects whose sentiments were adverse
        to his form of government. Never has any man approached so near to a command
        which no one has executed, " Love those who curse 3-ou." Good nature, patience,
        forbearance, reconcilia tions of one family to another, the reverse of what
        is assumed for a motto by many rulers, were his daily practices. If our laws
        are defective, the fault is nowise his. On his return in the plenitude of
        power, he desired the people to decide by which code they would be governed,
        his father''s or Napoleon''s. The most celebrated jurists in Tuscany were
        convoked : the ministers and judges, who had served the three or four past
        governments, did what such men will alwa3rs do ; they took, as more condu
        cive to their power, the looser. Ferdinand ab stained from every remark upon
        their judgment ; but no man in his dominions was less pleased with it. English
        Visiter. The patriotic party . . . Florentine Visiter. Congratulated the choice.
        Florentine Visiter. You probably know Nico lini ; if not personally, at least
        by character. Landor. Although I avoid the society of lite rary men, desirous
        of taking no part in their differences, and to receive no displeasure or un
        easiness at the recital of their injuries, I have twice met him ; as modest
        a man as he is a dis tinguished poet. English Visiter. 0 Sismondi ! what a
        bottle of ink have these fellows been shaking up for thy admirable pen ! How
        think you, Landor ! what a garner is the study of a man like this ? Landor.
        Nothing is more useful than the study of such a philosopher : he is legible
        to all, and intelligible, and impressive : no doubtful dogma,', 1]

        \ harmony as the sentiment. Southey. The scazons to Salsilli are a just and\
        \ equitable return for his quatrain ; for they are full of false quantities,\
        \ without an iota of poetry. Landor. I find traces in Milton of nearly all\
        \ the best Latin poets, excepting Lucretius. This is singular ; for there\
        \ is in both of them a gene rous warmth and a contemptuous severity. I ad\
        \ mire and love Lucretius. There is about him a simple majesty, a calm and\
        \ lofty scorn of every thing pusillanimous and abject : and consistently with\
        \ this character, his poetry is masculine, plain, concentrated, and energetic.\
        \ But since inven tion was precluded by the subject, and glimpses of imagination\
        \ could be admitted through but few and narrow apertures, it is the insanity\
        \ of enthu siasm to prefer his poetical powers to those of Virgil, of Catullus,\
        \ and of Ovid ; in all of whom every part of what constitutes the true poet\
        \ is much more largely displayed. The excellence of Lucretius is, that his\
        \ ornaments are never out of place, and are always to be found wherever there\
        \ is a place for them. Ovid knows not what to do with his, and is as fond\
        \ of accumulation as the frequenter of auction-rooms. He is playful so out\
        \ of season, that he reminds me of a young lady I saw at Sta. Maria Novella,\
        \ who at one mo ment crossed herself, and at the next tickled her companion,\
        \ by which process they were both put upon their speed at their prayers, and\
        \ made very good and happy. Small as is the portion of glory which accrues\
        \ to Milton from his Latin poetry, there are single sentences in it, ay, single\
        \ images, worth all that our island had produced before. In all the volume\
        \ of Buchanan I doubt whether you can discover a glimpse of poetry ; and few\
        \ sparks fly off the anvil of May. There is a confidence of better days expressed\
        \ in this closing poem. Enough is to be found in his Latin to insure him a\
        \ high rank and a last ing name. It is however to be regretted that late in\
        \ life he ran back to the treasures of his youth, and estimated them with\
        \ the fondness of that undiscerning age. No poet ever was sorry that he abstained\
        \ from early publication. But Milton seems to have cherished his first effusions\
        \ with undue partiality. Many things written later by him are unworthy of\
        \ preservation, especially those which exhibit men who provoked him into bitterness.\
        \ Hatred, the most vulgar of vulgar isms, could never have belonged to his\
        \ natural character. He must have contracted the distem per from theologians\
        \ and critics. The scholar in his days was half clown and half trooper. Col\
        \ lege-life could leave but few of its stains and incrustations on a man who\
        \ had stept forward so soon into the amenities of Italy, and had con versed\
        \ so familiarly with the most polished gentlemen of the most polished nation.\
        \ Landor. But how gloriously he burst forth again in all his splendour for\
        \ Manso ; for Manso, who before had enjoyed the immortal honour of being the\
        \ friend of Tasso. Diis dilecte senex ! te Jupiter \xE6quus oportet Nascentem\
        \ et miti lustrarit lumine Ph\u0153bus, Atlantisque nepos ; neque enim nisi\
        \ charus ab ortu Bits superis poterit magno favisse poet\u0153. And the remainder\
        \ of the poem is highly enthu siastic. What a glorious verse is, Frangam Saxonicas\
        \ Britonum sub marte phalanges. Southey. I have often wondered that our poets,\
        \ and Milton more especially, should be the parti sans of the Britons rather\
        \ than of the Saxons. I do not add the Normans ; for very few of our poets\
        \ are Norman by descent. The Britons seem to have been a barbarous and treacherous\
        \ race, inclined to drunkenness and quarrels. Was the whole nation ever worth\
        \ this noble verse of Milton ? It seems to come sounding over the \xC6gean\
        \ Sea, and not to have been modulated on the low country of the Tiber. Landor.\
        \ In his pastoral on the loss of Diodati, entitled Epitaphium Damonis, there\
        \ are many beautiful verses : for instance, Ovium quoque t\xE6det, at ill\xE6\
        \ M\u0153rent, inque suum convertunt ora magistrum. The pause at m\u0153rent,\
        \ and the word also, show the great master. In Virgil himself it is impossible\
        \ to find anything more scientific. Here, as in Lycidas, mythologies are intermixed,\
        \ and the heroic bursts forth from the pastoral. Apollo could not for ever\
        \ be disguised as the shepherd boy of Admetus. Supra caput imber et Eurus\
        \ Triste sonant, fraclaque agitato, crepuscula sylvce. Southey. This is finely\
        \ expressed : but he found the idea not untouched before. Gray, and others\
        \ have worked upon it since. It may be well to say little on the Presentation\
        \ of the poems to the Bodleian Library. Strophes and antistrophes are here\
        \ quite out of place ; and on no occasion has any Latin poet so jumbled together\
        \ the old me tres. Many of these are irregular and imperfect. Ion Actea genitus\
        \ Creusa is not a verse : authorum is not Latin. Et tutela dahit solers Rousi\
        \ is defective in metre. This Pindaric ode to Rouse the librarian, is indeed\
        \ fuller of faults than any other of his Latin compositions. He tells us himself\
        \ that he has admitted a spondee for the third foot in the phaleucian verse,\
        \ because Catul lus had done so in the second. He never wrote such bad verses,\
        \ or gave such bad reasons, all his life before. But beautifully and justly\
        \ has he said, Southey. In his attacks on Salmasius, and others more obscure,\
        \ he appears to have mistaken his talent in supposing he was witty. Landor.\
        \ Is there a man in the world wise enough to know whether he himself is witty\
        \ or not, to the extent he aims at ? I doubt whether any question needs more\
        \ self-examination. It is only the fool's heart that is at rest upon it. He\
        \ never asks how the matter stands, and feels con- Si quid meremur sana posteritas\

        \ Tam of the poet appears, \u2014 a jolly, careless, rustic, who took much\
        \ more interest in the contraband traffic of the coast, than the rotation\
        \ of crops. Burns knew the man well ; and to his dying day, he, nothing loath,\
        \ passed among his rural compeers by the name of Tam o' Shanter. A few words\
        \ will bring us to the close of Burns's career at Elliesland. Mr. Ramsay of\
        \ Ochtertyre, happening to pass through Nithsdale in 17 90, met Burns riding\
        \ rapidly near Closeburn. The poet was obliged to pursue his professional\
        \ journey, but sent on Mr. Ramsay and his fellow-traveller to Elliesland,\
        \ where he joined them as soon as his duty permitted him, saying, as he entered,\
        \ \" I come, to use the words of Shakspeare, stewed in haste.\" Mr. Ramsay\
        \ was \" much pleased with his u.ror Sabina qnalis, and his modest mansion,\
        \ so unlike the habitation of ordinary rustics.\" The evening was spent delightfully.\
        \ A gentleman of dry temperament, who looked in accidentally, soon partook\
        \ the contagion, and sat listen ing to Burns with the tears running over his\
        \ cheeks. \" Poor Burns!\" says Mr. Ramsay, \" from that time I met him no\
        \ more.\" The summer after, some English travellers, calling at Elliesland,\
        \ were told that the poet was walking by the river. They proceeded in search\
        \ ot him, and presently, \" on a rock that projected into the stream, they\
        \ saw a man employed in angling, of a singular appearance. He had a cap made\
        \ of a fox's skin on his head ; a loose greatcoat, fastened round him by a\
        \ belt, from which depended an enormous Highland broadsword. It was Burns.\
        \ He received them with great cordiality, and asked them to share his humble\
        \ dinner.\" These travellers also classed the evening they spent at Elliesland\
        \ with the brightest of their lives. Towards the close of 1791, the poet,\
        \ finally despairing of his farm, de termined to give up his lease, which\
        \ the kindness of his landlord rendered easy of arrangement ; and procuring\
        \ an appointment to the Dumfries divi sion, which raised his salary from the\
        \ revenue to \xA370 per annum, removed his family to the county town, in which\
        \ he terminated his days. His con duct as an excise officer had hitherto met\
        \ with uniform approbation ; and he nourished warm hopes of being promoted,\
        \ when he had thus avowedly devoted himself altogether to the service. He\
        \ left Elliesland, however, with a heavy heart. The affection of his neighbours\
        \ was rekindled in all its early fervour by the thoughts of parting with him\
        \ ; and the roup of his farming-stock and other effects, was, in spite of\
        \ whisky, a very melancholy scene. The competition for his chatties was eager,\
        \ each being anxious to secure a memorandum of Burns's residence among them.\
        \ It is pleasing to know, that among other \" titles manifold\" to their respect\
        \ and gratitude, Burns had superintended the formation of a subscription library\
        \ in the parish. His letters to the booksellers on this subject do him much\
        \ honour: his choice of authors (which business was naturally left to his\
        \ discretion) being in the highest degree judicious. Such institutions are\
        \ now common, almost universal, indeed, in all the rural districts of southern\
        \ Scotland . but it should never be forgotten that Burns was among the first,\
        \ if not the very first, to set the example. \" He was so good,\" says Mr.\
        \ Riddel, \" as to take the whole management of this concern ; he was treasurer,\
        \ librarian, and censor, to our little society, who will long have a grateful\
        \ sense of his public spirit, and exertions for their improvement and information.\"\
        \ Once, and only once, did Burns quit his residence at Elliesland to revisit\

        \ to improve the mind and refine the j taste, without any danger of becoming\
        \ more un- \u25A0 i happy in their situation, or discontented with it. Nor\
        \ do I think there is any danger of their be coming less useful. There are\
        \ some hours every dav that the most constant labourer is neither at work\
        \ nor asleep. These hours are either ap propriated to amusement or to sloth.\
        \ If a taste for employing these hours in reading were cul tivated, I do not\
        \ suppose that the return to la bour would be more difficult. Every one will\
        \ allow, that the attachment to idle amusements, or even to sloth, has as\
        \ powerful a tendency to abstract men from their proper business, as the attachment\
        \ to books ; while the one dissipates the mind, and the other tends to increase\
        \ its powers of self-government. To those who are afraid that the improvement\
        \ of the minds of the common people might be dangerous to the state, or the\
        \ established order of society, I would re mark, that turbulence and commotion\
        \ are cer tainly very inimical to the feelings of a refined mind. Let the\
        \ matter he brought to tbe test of experience and observation. Of what de\
        \ scription of people are mobs and insurrections composed ? Are they not universally\
        \ owing to the want of enlargement and improvement of mind among the common\
        \ people ? Nay, let any one recollect the characters of those who formed the\
        \ calmer and more deliberate associa- tions, which lately gave so much alarm\
        \ to the government of this country. I suppose few of the common people who\
        \ were to le found in such societies, had the education and turn of mind I\
        \ have been endeavouring to recommend. Allow me to suggest one reason for\
        \ endeavour- ing to enlighten the minds of the common peo- ple. Their morals\
        \ have hitherto been guarded by a sort of dim religious awe, which from a\
        \ variety of causes seems wearing off. I think the alteration in this respect\
        \ considerable, in tbe short period of my observation. I have already given\
        \ my opinion of the effects of refinement of mind on morals and virtue. Whenever\
        \ vulgar minds begin to shake off the dogmas of the re- ligion in which they\
        \ have been educated, the progress is quick and immediate to downright infidelity\
        \ : aud nothing but refinement of mind can enable them to distinguish between\
        \ the pure essence of religion, and the gross systems which men have been\
        \ perpetually connecting it with. In addition to what has already heeo done\
        \ for the education of the common people of this coun- try, in the estab ishment\
        \ us parish schools, I wish to see the salaries augmented in some pro- portion\
        \ to the present expense us liviDg, and the earnings of [people of similar\
        \ rank, endowments and usefulness, in society ; and I hope that the liberality\
        \ of the present age will be nu lunger disgraced by refusing, to so u-eful\
        \ a class of men, such encouragement as may make parish schools worth the\
        \ attention of men fitted for the impor- tant duties of tint office. In filling\
        \ up the va- cancies, I would have more attention paid to the candidate's\
        \ capacity of reading the English lan guage with grace and propriety ; to\
        \ his under standing thoroughly, and having a high relish for the beauties\
        \ of English authors, both in poetry and prose ; to that good sense and knowledge\
        \ of human nature which would enable him to ac quire some influence on the\
        \ minds and aff .-ct ions of his scholars ; to the general worth of his cha-\
        \ racter, and the love of his king ami his country, than to his proficiency\
        \ in the knowledge of Latin and Greek. I would then have a sort of high English\
        \ class established, not only for the pur- pose of teaching the pupils to\
        \ read in that grace- ful and agreeable manner that might make them fond of\
        \ reading, but to make them understand what they read, and discover the beauties\
        \ of the author, in composition and sentiment. I would have established in\
        \ every parish a small circu- lating library-, consisting of the books which\
        \ the young people had read extracts from in the col- lections they had read\
        \ at school, and any other books well calculated to refine the mind, improve\
        \ the moral feelings, recommend the practice of virtue, and communicate such\
        \ knowledge as might be u-eful and suitable to tbe Idn-uring classes of men.\
        \ I would have the schoolmaster act as librarian, and in recommending books\
        \ to his young friends, formerly his pup.l-, and lot- ting in the light of\

        \ the parish of Dunscore, in Nithsdale. I beg leave to send it to you, be\
        \ cause it is new and may be useful. How far it is deserving of a place in\
        \ your patriotic publica tion, you are the best judge. To store the minds\
        \ of the lower classes with useful knowledge, is certainly of very great im\
        \ portance, both to them as individuals, and to sneiety at large. Giving them\
        \ a turn for read ing and reflection, is giving them a source of innocent\
        \ and laudable amusement ; and besides raises them to a mure dignified degree\
        \ in the scale of rationality. Impressed with this idea, a gentleman in this\
        \ parish, Hubert Riddel, Esq. of Glenriddel, set on foot a species of circulat\
        \ ing liberary, on a plan so simple as to be prac ticable in any corner of\
        \ the country ; and so useful, as to deserve the notice of every country gentleman,\
        \ who thinks tbe improvement of that part of his own species, whom chance\
        \ has thrown into the humble walks of the peasant and the aitizan, a matter\

        \ Thomas Linacre, M.D., was born in Derby, educated at Oxford, resided at\
        \ Rome and Florence, and was a learned and great physician. He founded two\
        \ public lectures in Oxford, and one in Cambridge, for the study of physic;\
        \ and the college of physicians in London. He was chief physician to Kings\
        \ Henry VII, and VIII. A short time before his death, which happened on the\
        \ 12th of October, 1024, he had become a priest. He was buried under a stately\
        \ monument in St. Paul's cathedral, London. Joseph Wright, an eminent painter,\
        \ was born in Derby, in 1734. He produced a set of historical pictures which\
        \ may deservedly rank amongst the earhest valuable productions of the modern\
        \ 6chool ; of these, the \" Blacksmith's Forge,\" \" Air-Punip,\" \" Gladiator,\"\
        \ and several others, are well known by Pether's mezzotintos. His style of\
        \ landscape painting is more varied than that of any other artist whose works\
        \ we are acquainted with. Sometimes he excites the sublimest ideas under the\
        \ various effects of day, fire, or moonlight. \u2014 At other times we are\
        \ soothed with the calm and still scenery of Italy, in which he introduces\
        \ the clear and brUliant skies peculiar to that climate. He, again, exhibits\
        \ the most playful execution and charming effects, which constitute the principal\
        \ beauty of our mountain scenery in Westmoreland and Cumberland. His judicious\
        \ combination of fire and moonlight has particularly attracted tlie admiration\
        \ of connoisseurs. A fine production of Vesuvius, by this artist, sold to\
        \ the Empress of Russia for 300 guineas.", 1]

        '' Maria Theresia, empress, queen, born 1717, died 1780. When she ascended
        the throne she found the monarchy without res sources, the people dissatisfied,
        the public treasure exhausted and an army amounting to but thirty thousand
        men. In this helpless condi tion she was at once assailed by Prussia , France
        , Spain, Bavaria and Saxony who all were going to destitute her of her hereditary
        country and though deserted by all, except herself and her faithful Hunga
        rians, she got out of this scrape more brilliant than ever. By sacri ficing
        Silesia she saved the Austrian monarchy and obtained the Im perial crown for
        her beloved husband Francis I. Purposing notwith standing the destruction
        of Prussia she allied herself with almost all European states yet the seven
        years'' war did not prove lucky for her and Frederick II. kept Silesia. From
        that time forwards the people of Austria enjoyed under her the blessings of
        an almost un interrupted peace and even now she is so far from being forgotten
        in that country that the days of her reign are in that country looked upon
        as its golden age. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, scholar and poet, born at Ka
        mentz 1729, died 1781. Lessing was an acute classic and the father of German
        criticism; he was one of the first who raised the German language so deeply
        sunken that Frederick the Great did not think it worth while to occupy himself
        with it. Acuteness of judgment is most striking in Lessing aud he therefore
        succeeded best in epigram of which his plays, unluckily, contain too great
        a number. His wri tings show a brilliant style and his prose is above all
        pure and vi gorous. He became librarian of the Wolfenbuttel library and had
        only then wherewithal to live. may be proud of Lessings'' having been one
        of her citizens," said the great John Muller. Frederick the Unparalleled,
        king of Prussia, born 1712, died 1786. The name of Frederick the Great is
        named with the greatest veneration both in Germany and abroad and there is
        no German monarch whom the people might be so proud of as of him, for he was
        not only the greatest general and statesman of his time but was likewise a
        learned man who mighty protected arts and sciences. When the greatest and
        most powerful part of Europe concluded a treaty of annihilation against him,
        he prudently and boldly began the war himself before the enemy was perfectly
        prepared and Maria Theresia having proudly rejected his claims to four principalities
        in Silesia, Frederick took almost the whole of it and when the peace was concluded
        he had not sacrificed a single village. Unluckily this beaming sun was not
        without some spots; the great German king had no German heart, and therefore
        did not value either German arts or sciences or religious sentiments. Posterity,
        the severe judge of all princes, blames him for having posed the dismemberment
        of Poland', 1]

        Hamburgh where he had retired, when Denmark placed him, what Germany his native
        country had not done, in a situation free from care. He became counsellor
        of the court to the king of Denmark Klopstocks lyre sounded but for the sublime
        and the noble, and in his odes on the fatherland and on the German language,
        sparkles the purest fire of patriotism and there he stands alone and without
        a rival among the Germans. William Heinse, writer, born at Langenwiesen 1749,
        died 1803. He had a highly gifted mind, an ardent imagination and a masterly
        style so that one may say from him, he does not write but paints like Correggio,
        he dips his pen in the glow of the south, every stroke is .a flame, every
        word an image, yet alas! an impure spirit prevails in all his writings and
        even Wieland, who however was not too scrupulous himself, was scandalized
        by his licence. Heinse died at Aschaffenhurg, where he had become librarian
        to the Elector of Mentz. John Godfrey de Herder, scholar, born at Morungen
        1744, died 1803. His mind is ideal and the ideal prevails through all his
        works, which were all poetical. He was unacquainted with scarcely any science,
        being distinguished as a theologian, aesthetician, philo logist, natural philosopher
        and historian. Humanity was the aim of his endeavours and his motto: Life,
        love, light. He was the first of the four great stars of Weimar where he,
        a poor shoemaker''s son, had been invested with the title of president of
        the high consistory, and raised to the rank of nobility by the Elector of
        Bavaria. Immanuel Kant, philosopher, born at Konigsberg 1724, died 1804. He
        was a keenly investigating thinker, a man of the under standing in the very
        sense of the expression, dry in soul as in body, a man who never knew the
        heavenly bliss of sweet sentiments and feelings. He was an enemy to fancy
        and to music, but a friend to mankind and teaching integrity in word and deed.
        He was one of the most distinguished philosophers of his age and founder of
        a phi losophical school, the doctrines of which have become the property of
        almost all the German nation. This extraordinary man, whose purpose was not
        to teach the scholar philosophy, but- to philosophize, learnt, taught and
        died at Konigsberg, and never went farther than seven miles from thence. Frederick
        de Schiller, poet, bora at Marbach 1759, died 1805. The works of this poet
        have become more than those of any other author, the property of the whole
        German nation; he is the fa vourite poet of the Germans and his name will
        be spoken of as long as the language itself, in which his works are written,
        shall be spoken. As a lyrical poet Schiller is still greater than as a dramatic
        one. He was not favoured by fortune and had no riches which enabled him to
        live but for the Muses, on the contrary, Schiller, like most of the German
        poets, was obliged to write in order to obtain a competency and it was not
        till when he came to Weimar, the German Athens for a time, that his situation
        became more comfortable. His life was good and amiable and as pure as his
        muse; he was an original poet, imitated by many, but attained by none.', 1]

        \ a similar nature may be avoided through this calamity allotted to us. On\
        \ the day above mentioned, which was very destructive to us, a vile plumber,\

        \ and fire, on rubbish, or steps of a great height, upon dry wood, with some\
        \ turf and other combustibles. About noon (in the cross, in the body of the\
        \ church, where he remained at his work till after mass) he descended before\
        \ the pro cession of the convent, thinking that the fire had been put out\
        \ by his workmen. They, however, came down quickly after him, without having\
        \ completely extinguished the fire ; and the fire among the charcoal revived,\
        \ and partly from the heat of the iron, and partly from the sparks of the\
        \ charcoal, the fire spread itself to the wood and other combustibles beneath.\
        \ After the fire was thus commenced, the lead melted, and the joists upon\
        \ the beams ignited ; and then the fire increased prodigiously, and con sumed\

        \ of literature ; and through all the blind bigotry of early superstition,\

        \ of savage times, still maintained in due estimation the noble writings of\
        \ the fathers, and beau tifully transcribed into their parchment-missals the\
        \ immortal remains of the poets, philosophers, and historians of Greece and\

        \ and tutors of colleges, its business being chiefly confined to the granting\
        \ of degrees and dispensations: the vice-chan cellor has a negative on its\
        \ proceedings, and the proctors conjointly have the same privilege. Convocation\
        \ is the legislative assembly of the university, comprising all doctors and\
        \ masters resident or not, whose names are on the books of a college or hall;\
        \ and its business is unlimited, extending to all subjects affecting the credit,\
        \ interest, and welfare of the corporate body. The sta tutes, however, cannot\
        \ be altered, nor any new laws be enacted, before the matter has been referred\
        \ to the hebdomadal meeting of the vice-chancellor, proctors, and heads of\
        \ houses, who, if they approve of the measure, draw up the terms in which\
        \ it must be promulgated in convocation. The hebdomadal meeting was first\
        \ insti tuted in the reign of Charles I. The public professorships of Oxford\
        \ are of 2 classes, those established by royal foundation, and those sup ported\
        \ by private endowment. The regius-professor ships of divinity, civil law,\
        \ medicine, Greek, and He brew, were founded by Henry VIII., and canonries\
        \ in. Christchurch cathedral are attached to the chairs of Divinity and Hebrew.\
        \ George I. also founded a regius professorship of modern history in 1724,\
        \ which was con firmed by George II. in 1728. There is also, as at Cam bridge,\
        \ a margaret-professor of divinity. The other professorships are, 1. of natural\
        \ philosophy, founded by Sir ;W. Sedley, in 1618; 2. geometry and astronomy,\
        \ established by Sir H. Savile; 3. moral philosophy, by Dr. White, in 1621;\
        \ 4. ancient history, by W. Camden,in 1622; 5. anatomy, in 1626 ; 6. Arabic,\
        \ by Archbishop Laud, in 1636; 7. botany, in 1632 ; 8. poetry, in 1708 ; 9.\
        \ Anglo- Saxon, in 1750 ; 10. common law, by Charles Viner, in 1755; 11. clinical\
        \ medicine, in 1772; 12, 13, 14. anatomy, practice of medicine, and chemistry,\
        \ by Dr. Aldrich, in 1803; 15. political economy, in 1835 ; and, 16. Sanscrit,\
        \ by Colonel Boden, in 1830. There are also lectureships or readerships of\
        \ Arabic, anatomy, experimental philoso phy, mineralogy, and geology\"; there\
        \ being, in all, 28 professors or readers. The lectures are delivered either\
        \ in the public schools, or in a building near them, formerly the university\
        \ printing-office. An edifice, however, is in course of erec tion, the funds\
        \ for which are provided by thc munificent bequest of the late Michael Angelo\
        \ Taylor : it will be. when completed, one of the finest buildings belonging\
        \ to the university, and will comprise several large lecturing theatres for\
        \ the professors, besides a noble picture-gal- lery for the reception of the\
        \ numerous portraits and other pictures belonging to the university. The public\
        \ orator, who delivers the Creweian oration alternately with the professor\
        \ of poetry, is chosen by convocation ; and his office is to write public\
        \ letters and make addresses on grand occasions in the name of the university.\
        \ The archives are kept by a registrar, elected ?\xBB,* conrocation: this\
        \ office was first established in 163-1. The Clarendon press is superintended\
        \ by dele- gates, of whom the vice chancellor and proctors form .3 ex afficio:\
        \ the rest are heads of houses. The present building, opened in 1829, is of\
        \ great extent, the bible department is on a magnificent scale, and the editions\
        \ of classical and other works printed at this establishment are celebrated\
        \ both for beauty and accuracy. The Bod- leian library, founded by Sir Thomas\
        \ Bodley, is the pro perty of the university, and its affairs are regulated\
        \ by the vice-chancellor, proctors, and the five regiiprofes sors, its officers\
        \ being a librarian, 2 under-librarians, and 2 assistants. It has received\
        \ many valuable additions from the libraries of Selden, Archbishop Laud, Bishop\
        \ Tanner, Browne Willis, Hearne, Gough, Malone, &c j and it now comprises,\
        \ exclusive of about 300,000 printed books, a great number of valuable MSS.\
        \ : it is entitled, also, to a copy of all new works published in the United\
        \ Kingdom. It is said, however, to be of less utility than might have been\
        \ supposed. Owing to a justifiable apprehension of fire, the library is very\
        \ inadequately warmed, and is very uncomfortable in winter; and the books\
        \ are not allowed to be removed from the library. But though this be a very\
        \ proper regulation as respects the rare and more valuable works, all the\
        \ more common works might be lent out here as in Edinburgh, on lodging a deposit\
        \ equal to their value, without any loss to the library, and with very great\
        \ advantage to the students. The Radcliffe library, founded by Dr. Radcliffe,\
        \ in 1718, and erected at an expense of 40,000/. is under private trustees,\
        \ and has little or no connection with the university. The books in this collection\
        \ are principally on medicine and natural history. An observatory was erected\
        \ in 1772, out of the funds left by the same munificent individual, and the\
        \ observer (commonly the Savilian professor of astro- nomy) is appointed by\
        \ the Radcliffe trustees. The Ash- molean museum was built in 1683, for the\
        \ accommodation of a rich collection of natural objects and articles of virlil,\
        \ brought together by Elias Ashmole : large additions are annually made to\
        \ it ; and in the department of natural history, this museum is inferior only\
        \ to the British Mu- seum, and that of the Zoological Society. It is under\
        \ the care of official visiters, appointed by Ashmole's will. The few remarks\
        \ we ventured to make, under the article Cambridge, on the system of education\
        \ followed in that university, apply with little variation to Oxford. This,\
        \ like its sister institution, is essentially a scholastic establishment,\
        \ and is well fitted to make good Greek and Latin scholars, and perhaps good\
        \ divines. But it is obviously quite unsuitable, as a place of instruction,\
        \ for the elite of the youth of such a country as this. It must be entirely\
        \ changed before it either send forth legis lators capable of appreciating\
        \ the various interests of this vast empire, or individuals capable of promoting\
        \ and extending those manufacturing and commercial pursuits, to the success\
        \ of which we are mainly indebted for our unparalleled increase in wealth\
        \ and population. The university of Oxford received, in 1603, the privi lege\
        \ of sending two representatives to the H. of C. ; the right of election is\
        \ vested in the vice-chancellor, doctors, and other members of convocation,\

        \ England, that she was the magna virum mater, that she bred and sent forth\
        \ the men who es tablished this mighty empire in the wilderness. But it would\
        \ be invidious to attempt to insti tute any comparison between the English\
        \ and Americans of the present day. That their cha racters have diverged considerably\
        \ is certain. Nor is this to be wondered at, seeing the ex tremely different\
        \ circumstances under which the mother people and their descendants have been\
        \ placed. The merits and the faults of the latter both stand prominently forward\
        \ ; and may be easily and sati'factorily accounted for by those who fairly\
        \ appreciate the nature of the country they inhabit, and the institutions\
        \ under which they live. It may be further observed, that the bank ruptcy\
        \ and mischief occasioned by her wrorthless banking system, and the disorder\
        \ it introduces into all the commercial dealings ofthe country, only affects\
        \ her prosperity in a very slight degree. The latter is essentially bottomed\
        \ on agriculture, or rather on the facility with which all classes may acquire\
        \ tracts of fertile and unoccupied land. The great mass ofthe American citizens\
        \ may, like Ant\xE6us, on the occurrence of any diffi culty, fall back upon\
        \ the land, and gather new vigour from its embrace. The merchants and ship-owners\
        \ in the great towns, the speculators in banks, railway and canal shares,\
        \ &c, may be ruined, the local governments may be reduced to a disgraceful\
        \ state of bankruptcy, and even the federal government be involved in the\
        \ greatest difficulties, without affecting the elements of the national prosperity,\
        \ or having any mate rial influence over the condition of the great bulk of\
        \ the people. In this respect America differs from most other countries ;\
        \ but it is to be observed, that this difference depends wholly on natural\
        \ circumstances; it is not occasioned by any foresight on the part of the\
        \ American people, or any peculiar excellence in their government or institutions;\

        \ pupils, though of these only from 800 to 900 may be resident at any one\
        \ time. Thus in the winter session of 1837, the Universitv had in all 1,376\
        \ students, of whom 874 were resident. Of the entire number, 209 attended\
        \ the theological. 305 the legal 142 the medical, and 408 the philosophical\

        \ Reggio, Garfagnana, and Massa-Carrara. Modena is the cap. ; the other principal\
        \ towns are Reggio, Carrara, Massa, and Finale. The government is an absolute\
        \ monarchy, and perhaps the most despotical in its form of any in Europe.\
        \ The duke monopolises both the legislative and executive power ; but he avails\
        \ himself of the services of a prime minister, 2 secretaries of state, and\
        \ a privy coun cil. The Austrian civil code of laws has been adopted since\
        \ 1815. There are tribunals of primary jurisdiction in Modena, Reggio, and\
        \ Massa, and a nigh court of appeal in Modena. A college is established in\
        \ each of the prin cipal towns, and the capital has a university and some\
        \ superior schools; but owing to the jealousy of the go vernment and the restraints\
        \ laid on the press, public in struction is in a very backward state. The\
        \ military force consists of 1 ,750 men. It is recruited by volunteers ; the\

        \ from all personal taxes. The public revenue is estimated at about 1,500,000\
        \ florins a year. The greater part of this territory was erected in 1452 into\
        \ a duchy, under Borso D'Este, son of Pope Nicholas III. It was taken by the\
        \ French in 1797, and subdivided into the deps. of Panaro and Crostolo. In\

        \ Stato Estense, a state of N. Italy, consisting of the united duchies of\
        \ Modena and Massa-Carrara, principally in cluded between the 10th and llth\
        \ degs. of N. lat. and the 44th and 45th of E. long. ; having N. Austrian\
        \ Italy ; E. the N. delegs. ofthe Papal states ; W. Parma, and a portion of\
        \ the Sardinian dom. ; and S. Tuscany, Lucca, and the Mediterranean. Area\
        \ estimated at 2.090 sq.m., and the pop. at 40:1,000. The N. part of this\
        \ duchy con sists of a portion of the great plain of Lombardy ; the S. is\
        \ traversed from W. to E. by the Appennines, one of the summits of which in\
        \ this duchy, M. Cimone, rises to up wards o: 6,500 ft. above the sea. The\
        \ Po constitutes a small portion only of the N. boundary ; next to it the\
        \ principal rivers are its affluents, the Panaro, Secchia, Crostolo, Enza,\
        \ Sec ; which have their sources on the N. slope ol\" the Appennines, and\
        \ flow N. to the Po; and the Magra and Serchio, which rise on the S. slope\
        \ of the Appennines, and fall into the Mediterranean. The cli mate differs\
        \ on the different sides of the mountains. On the N. it is similar to that\
        \ of Parma and the Lombardo Venetian kingdom ; snow falls and cold weather\
        \ lasts for several weeks in the winter; while to the S. of the mountains\
        \ the climate is like that of Genoa, and the olive and orange flourish in\
        \ the open air. The plain country is very fertile, and abundantly watered\
        \ by rivulets and canals. In the mountains there are many peasant proprietors,\
        \ but not in the plains. A great evil here, as in other parts of Lombardy,\
        \ is the practice of the lords and the possessors of lands in mortmain letting\
        \ to middle men, who relet to metayers ; under which tenure are all the lands\
        \ of the duchy. The tenant furnishes half the cattle, and the landlord the\
        \ other half. Apparently there is not a labourer's house in the country, all\
        \ being metay ing farmers. (Arthur Young's Trav.n. 157.) The distribution\
        \ of the land is much the same as in the rest ofthe plain of Lombardy, where,\
        \ according to Cha teauvieux, very few farms exceed 60 acres. The me tayers\
        \ should receive half the produce for their labour and attention, but the\
        \ actual quantity falling to their share varies considerably according to\
        \ circumstances, and in many cases is not more than l-3d part of the crops\
        \ produced. The custom of sharing the produce is, however, almost universal\
        \ ; and a lease at a fixed rent being extremely rare, we need not wonder at\
        \ the low state of industry. (Chateauvieux, Italy and its Agric. p. 17., &c.)\
        \ Rice, wheat, maize, fruits, wine, oil, and hemp are the principal articles\
        \ of culture ; but the supply of corn is notwithstanding inadequate for the\
        \ consump tion. The wine of the duchy is strong, but not of su perior quality\
        \ : the oil S. of the mountains is equal to that of Genoa, but that produced\
        \ in the N. plains is very inferior. Bees, poultry, and hogs are numerous.\
        \ Cattle breeding is not very extensively pursued, except in the valley of\
        \ Garfagnana, where it is almost the sole occu pation of the inhabs. The pasturages\
        \ on the mountains are excellent ; but only the duke and a few of the larger\
        \ proprietors possess any considerable flocks of sheep. Horses few; oxen of\
        \ the Lombard and Swiss breeds, and asses, supplying their place for draught,\
        \ &c, on almost every farm. The declivities ofthe Appennines are clothed with\
        \ fine woods of oak, beech, pine, and chest nut ; indeed, chestnut flour forms\
        \ the principal food of the peasantry iu the upland region for a considerable\
        \ portion of the year. The labouring classes, even in the more productive\
        \ parts of the duchy, live very sparingly ; soup of Turkish wheat, or polenta,\
        \ salads, and beans or other pulse, fried in oil, are their ordinary food.\
        \ Butcher's meat scarcely ever appears except on the tables of the more opulent\
        \ farmers, and their best beverage is refuse wine, or wine of the second pressure.\
        \ Next in importance to rural husbandry, is the culture and manufacture of\
        \ silk, though the products be of indif ferent quality. The other manufactures\
        \ are on a small scale. They consist principally of canvass, leather, paper,\

        \ on the civil wars, and between 1806 and 1818 the Lansdowne, Hargrave, and\
        \ Burney MSS. were purchased at an expense of 26,400/. Various presents have\
        \ been made from time to time, but the most valuable addition of late years\
        \ has been the library of George III., collected at an expense of 200,000/.,\
        \ and presented to the Museum by his successor.* Modern English publications\
        \ are added, free of expense, in consequence of a privilege which this esta-\
        \ blishment enjoys in common with the two universities, and some other bodies,\
        \ of receiving gratis a copy of every book entered at Stationer's Hall ; and\
        \ about 3,000/. a year are expended in the purchase of old and foreign works,\
        \ in the latter of which, however, the library is still extremely deficient.\
        \ There are about 330,000 printed books, and 27,000 MSS., exclusive of charters.\
        \ The want of a catalogue raisonne\" is much felt by the great majority of\
        \ persons who resort to the library for study or research. The reading-rooms\
        \ are open from 9 till 4 in winter, and till 7 in the evening during 4 summer\
        \ months. The average number of readers is about 220 a day. Admission is procured\
        \ by a recommendatory letter either to one of the trustees, or to the chief\
        \ librarian ; and every facility is given by the numerous attendants for'\
        \ the most extensive research. No books are allowed to be taken out, it being\
        \ supposed that such permission would lead to frequent and heavy losses ;\
        \ but, provided the value of the books were previously deposited, we incline\
        \ to think that certain descriptions of works might be lent out with great\
        \ advantage. In the depart- ment of antiquities may be mentioned the collection\
        \ of Egyptian monuments, including the famous Rosetta stone (see Vol. I. p.\
        \ 751.1, acquired at the capitulation of Alexandria, in 1801 ; the Townley\
        \ marbles, purchased for 28,000/.; thePhigalian and tlie Elgin marbles, the\
        \ cost of which was 35,000/. ; the latter include the statues of Theseus and\
        \ Ilissus, and the sculptures in alto-relievo, from the friezes of the Parthenon.\
        \ The collection of minerals was, for many years, deficient in various import-\
        \ ant particulars ; but the recent additions purchased from Messrs. Hawkins\
        \ and Mantell are extremely valu. able ; and now, both for size and classification,\
        \ this department will bear to be compared with any mine- ralogical collection\
        \ in Europe. The department of zoology is rich in birds and insects, but poor\
        \ in other respects, especially in mammalia. The collection of medals, which\
        \ has been accumulating since the found- ation of the museum, consists of\
        \ about 20,000 coins, above 6,000 .being purchased with the Hamilton col-\
        \ lection of Herculanean antiquities, in 1772. The coins can only be seen\
        \ by an order from a trustee, or a private introduction to the officer to\
        \ whose charge they are entrusted. The public days at the museum are Mondays,\

        \ each contributed, at least 400/., to the funds of the in stitution ; but\
        \ very recently the qualification for a governor has been raised to 500/.\
        \ An individual, on becoming a governor, is entitled to present one boy; and\
        \ he has usually a presentation once every succeeding three years. The present\
        \ (1840) revenue of the hos pital, arising from rents, and all other sources,\

        \ 424 boys and 76 girls ; making in all 1,267 children, maintained, clothed,\
        \ and well edu cated by the establishment. There are schools for grammar,\
        \ mathematics, writing, and drawing. The Gre cians, or those most advanced\
        \ in the grammar-school, are sent with valuable exhibitions to Oxford aud\
        \ Cam bridge, and those in the mathematical school are placed with commanders\
        \ of ships, and equipped with clothing and nautical instruments, at the hospital's\

        \ arrangements deserve the highest praise ; and every attention is paid to\
        \ the health and comfort of the children. The well-known dress of the boys,\
        \ which has not been changed since the formation of the institution, is, however,\
        \ not merely antiquated, but inconvenient and uncomfortable ; and it is certainly\
        \ high time that it were modified. Presentations can only be obtained from\

        \ 1835, may be said to have resulted from the inquiries of the Charity Commissioners.\
        \ A Mr. Carpenter had left an estate for a school, and the value of the property\
        \ had greatly increased without any proper application of the funds. Repeated\
        \ inquiries and remonstrances at length induced the corporation to establish\
        \ a school on the site of Honey-lane Market, Cheapside. The system of in struction\
        \ is good, and the school is attended by upwards of 400 boys. The buildings,\
        \ occupying a space 180 ft long and 80 ft. broad, are commodiously contrived,\
        \ and have externally some pretensions to architectural ele gance. Independently\
        \ of the endowed schools, almost every parish supports a free school by voluntary\
        \ contri butions, and thus about 12,000 children of both sexes are clothed\
        \ and educated. The number of private and Sun day schools is considerable,\
        \ hut cannot be accurately esti mated. The National Society, which has its\
        \ model school in the Sanctuary at Westminster, gives instruction in various\
        \ schools to nearly 9,000 children, and upwards of 3,000 are taught in the\
        \ Lancastrian method by the British and Foreign School Society, which has\
        \ a good normal and model school in the Borough Road. Much, however, still\
        \ remains to be done towards giving a sound elementary education to the children\
        \ of the industrious classes ; though, at the same time, it must be admitted\
        \ that more has been effected in this respect during the last 20 years than\
        \ our ancestors had done during entire centuries. (Carlisle; Edue Rep.) The\
        \ charges on account of education at most of the public schools in London\
        \ are oppressively high, far higher, indeed, than they ought to be : and this\
        \ circum stance, combined with the want of schools in many dis tricts, and\
        \ the wish to improve their health, has led to the practice, so general in\
        \ London, of sending children to the outskirts of the town to be boarded and\
        \ educated. But the education in very many of these boarding esta blishments\
        \ is of a very worthless description : and it is really surprising that no\

        \ before seeing land again, when they passed down a prom ontory, probably\
        \ the east side of Cape Cod, stretching east and north; and then turning west\
        \ between an island, (Martha's Vine yard) and the main land, they entered\
        \ a bay (Naragansett Bay) through which a river (Taunton River) flowed, when\
        \ they came to anchor and went ashore. Resolving to spend the winter here\

        \ first spring.\" Early in the season they returned to Greenland. Leif s return\
        \ became the principle subject of conversation. The next adventure was Thorwold\
        \ his brother. And you will observe that he and the other navigators gave\
        \ the same account of places they visited. Were not this the case, who could\

        \ as some say, there have been several works published \"in Europe upwards\
        \ of a century, which speak of these facts. Wormius speaks of this discovery\
        \ in a Latin translation, published in the University of Oxford, in or about\
        \ 1716. In Adam of Bremen's account, published 1629, he uses the following\
        \ striking language: \" Non fabulosa opinione, sed certa relatione Danorum;\"\
        \ that is, in a free traasla tion, \" This is not a fabulous opinion, but\
        \ a true narrative given by the Danes themselves.\" Dr. Franklin, in a letter\
        \ to a distinguished antiquary formerly of Switzerland, says positively that\
        \ the Danes came into New England before the time of Columbus. Dr. Mather\
        \ published an account, also, of this discovery in 1772. The celebrated Dr.\

        \ was well known to the Iceland ers \u2014 that it was authenticated by Northern\
        \ historians. It is a remarkable fact, that Iceland, where these documents\
        \ relating to the early discovery were preserved, was the Athens of the North,\
        \ during the Dark Ages. During the Middle Ages, the Icelanders were the most\
        \ intelligent people in the North. Even now, as Henderson says, youth can\
        \ repeat passages from Latin and Greek authors, who have never been but a\
        \ few miles from the place of their birth. Truly, the hardy Icelanders were\

        \ communication be tween Norway and Greenland, \u2014 a stepping stone, as\
        \ it were, from one continent to another. Iceland, thought by some to be the\
        \ \" Ultima Thule \" of Virgil, was discovered by the Norwegians in 861. The\
        \ oppression of king Harold Harfaga drove them there for an asylum. But the\

        \ made incursions in every direction, and discovered Greenland in 984. In\

        an entertainment, almost as magnificent, was given by the corporation to the
        Duke of Wellington. The corporation of London have, within the last few years,
        estabUshed a good library in the Guild hall, containing, besides a collection
        of general and historical literature, a considerable number of works, many
        of them rare or unique, relating to the anti quities of London and the manners
        of the citizens. Admission to this library, for the purpose of study, can
        be procured on the order of any member of the corporation. The present librarian
        is Mr. Herbert, the author of the "History of the Twelve City Companies."
        Continuing our course down Cheapside and the Poultry, we come in sight of
        the Mansion House, tin official residence of the Lord Mayor, and where he
        daily holds a minor court of justice for the hearing of complaints. The site
        of this building was for merly a market, caUed Stocks'' Market, from a pair
        of stocks erected there so early as 1281. It was a market for fish and flesh,
        and belonged for some time to the keepers of London Bridge, the revenues being
        appropriated to the support and repair of that structure. "Here," says Pennant,
        "stood the famous equestrian statue erected in honour of Charles H., by his
        most loyal subject Sir Robert Viner, lord mayor." Our author adds, that this

        be wrong to forget those whose courtesy has done much to facilitate the progress
        of this work. Though it may seem invidious to par ticularize where all have
        been equally kind, it is only justice to mention that the Honorable S. Young,
        and the Honorable N. S. Benton, Secretaries of State, and the several gentlemen
        connected with that department, have, in the most polite manner, afforded
        every facility for making extracts from the records in that office. The author
        is indebted to the Honorable Mr. Corning, one of the Trustees of the State
        Library, and to the Librarian of the Albany Institute, for the privilege of
        consulting, at his own residence, many rare historical works which would not
        have been, otherwise, easy of access. To General Stephen van Rensselaer he
        is beholden, like wise, in a special degree, for the very handsome and unreserved
        manner in which that gentleman placed in his hands, his extensive and valuable
        collection of MSS., from which the chapter on the early settlement of Rens
        selaerswyck has been almost exclusively compiled, and many interesting papers
        borrowed, which are now given, for the first time, to the public. From the
        account books and court records of that " Colonie" have, also, been ar ranged
        the prices of imported merchandise, stock, and country produce ; the list
        of the settlers under the first Patroon, and other tables which will be found
        in the Appendix. The Map of New Netherland, which accompanies this volume,
        is in every particular an exact sac-simile of one of a very ancient date,

        passus, or nearly 59 miles, long, and its arches were occasionally 109 feet
        high. (Front. 15.) This also was completed by the emperor Claudius, as appears
        from the inscription still extant upon its remains over the Porta Maggiore
        ; where both enter the city on the same arch, the Anio Novus flowing over
        the Claudia. Hence it was conducted over the Caelian hill on the Arcus Neroniani
        or Caelimontani, which terminated, as we have already said, near the temple
        of Claudius. were performed. For the most part the original marbles of these
        fragments have disappeared, and the inscriptions on them are consequently
        only ex tant in MS. copies. One of the most ancient monu ments of this kind
        is the Fasti Maffeorum or Calendarium Maffeanum, so called from its having
        been preserved in the Palazzo Maffei. With a few lacunae, it contains all
        the twelve months; but what little information that is to be found in it,
        be sides the principal festivals, relates chiefly to Au gustus. The next in
        importance is the Fasti Praenestini, discovered at Praeneste (Palestrina)
        in 1774. Verrius Flaccus, the celebrated gram marian, arranged and annotated
        it, caused it to be cut in marble, and erected it in the forum at Prae neste.
        (Suet. III. Gramm. c. 17.) Only four or five months are extant, and those
        in an imperfect state. The Calendarium Amiterninum was discovered at Amitemum
        in 1703, and contains the months from May to December, but not entire. The
        calendar called Fasti Capranicorum, so named from its having formerly been
        preserved in the Pa lazzo Capranica, contains August and September complete.
        Other calendars of the same sort are the Antlvtinum, Venusinum, &c. Another
        lapidary document, but unfortunately in so imperfect a state that it often
        serves rather to puzzle than to instruct, is the Capitoline Plan. This is
        a large plan of Rome cut upon marble tablets, and appaiently of the age of
        Septimius Severus, though with subse quent additions. It was discovered by
        the architect Giovanni Antonio Dosi, in the pontificate of Pius IV., under
        the church of SS. Cosmo e Damiano; where, broken into many pieces, it was
        used as a covering of the walls. It came into the possession of Cardinal Farnese,
        but was put away in a lumber room and forgotten for more than a century. Being
        rediscovered, it was published in 1673, in 20 plates, by Giovanni Pietro Bellori,
        librarian to Queen Chris tina; and subsequently at the end of the 4th vo lume
        us the Thesaurus of Graevius. The original fragments were carried to Naples
        with the other property of the Farnese family, and were subse quently given
        by the king of Naples to Pope Benedict XIV. In 1742 Benedict presented them
        to the Capitoline Museum at Rome, where they now appear on the wall of the
        staircase; but several of the pieces had been lost, for which copies, after
        the designs of Bellori and marked with a star, were substituted. On these
        fragments the plans of some ancient buildings may be made out, but it is very
        seldom that their topographical connection can be traced. As Prucopius mentions
        fourteen aqueducts, five new ones must have been added between the time of
        Frontinus and of that historian ; but respecting only two have we any certain
        information. The first of these is probably the Aqua Trajana, which we find
        recorded upon coins of Trajan, and which is also mentioned in the Acta Martyr.
        S. Anton. The water was taken from the neighbourhood of the Lacus Sabatinus
        (Lago di Bracciano), and, being conducted to the height of the Janiculum,
        served to turn the mills under that hill. (Procop. B. G. i. 19.) This duct
        still serves to convey the Acqua Paola, which, however, has been spoilt by
        water taken from the lake. It was also called Ciminia. The Aqua Alexandrina
        was constructed by the emperor Alexander Severus for the use of his baths.
        (Lamprid. Alex. 25.) Originally it was the same as that now called Acqua Felice,
        but con ducted at a lower level. The Aqua Severiana is supposed to have been
        made by the emperor Septimius Severus for the use of his baths in the 1st
        Region ; but there is no evidence to establish its execution. The Aqua Antoniniana
        was probably executed by Caracalla for the service of his great baths in the
        12th Region; but this also is unsupported by any satisfactory proofs. (Canina,
        Indie, p. 620.) The names and history of a few other aqueducts which we sometimes
        find mentioned are too obscure to require notice here. It does not belong
        to this subject to notice the Roman Viae, an account of which will be found
        under that head. Sources and Literature of Roman Topo- graphy. With the exception
        of existing monuments, the chief and most authentic sources for the topography
        of Rome are the passages of ancient authors in which different localities
        are alluded to or described. In scriptions also area valuable source of information.
        By far the most important of these is the Monumentum Ancyranum, or copy of
        the record left by Augustus if his actions; an account of which is given else
        where. [Vol. I. p. 134.] To what is there said we need only add that the best
        and most useful edition of this document is that published at Berlin with
        the emendations of Franz, and a commentary by A. W. Zumpt (1845, 4to. pp.
        120). Another valuable inscription, though not nearly so important as the
        one just mentioned, is that called the Basis Capi tolina (Gruter, ech), containing
        the names of the Vici of 5 Regions (the 1st, 10th, 12th, 13th, and 14th),
        whose curatores and vicomagistri erected a monument to Hadrian. It will be
        found at the end of Becker''s Handbuch, vol. i. We may also mention among
        sources of this description the fragments of Calendars whicli have been found
        in various places, and which are frequently useful by marking the sites of
        temples where certain sacrifices Amongst the literary records relating to
        Roman topography, the first place must be assigned to the Notitia. The full
        title of this work is: Notitia Dignitatum utriusque Imperil, or in Partibus
        Ori entis et Occldentis ; and it is a statistical view of the Roman empire,
        of which the description of Rome forms only a small portion or appendix. It
        cannot be later than the reign of Constantine, since no Christian church is
        mentioned in it, and indeed no building later than that emperor; nor, on the
        other hand, can it be earlier, since numerous buildings of the 3rd century,
        and even some of Constantine''s, are named in it. The design of it seems to
        have been, to name the principal buildings or other objects which marked the
        boundaries of the different Re gions ; but we are not to assume that these
        objects are always named in the order in which they oc curred, which is far
        from being the case. This 3i 2', 1]

        \ the Epistles of Phalaris were forgeries, and in his remarks on this subject\

        \ the very thinnest leaf, and is disposed in such a way as to seem ten times\

        he commenced the laborious undertaking. Many of the books purchased at his

        show that she was well acquainted with those languages. This library is rich
        in the best editions of the classics ; and particularly in the early impressions
        of the fifteenth century. The library of the cathedral belonging to the Caroline
        College contains several manu scripts of the reformers Bullinger, Pelican,
        Bibliander, and Leon Juda ; particularly the translation of the Talmud by
        Pelican and Bibliander, which has never been printed ; also sixty volumes
        of letters from Zwingle and the early reformers, with a complete index. This
        collection, so interesting to ecclesiastical history, was formed by Henry
        Hottinger, the learned author of the " History of the Reformation," renowned
        for his extensive erudition, and particularly for his profound skdl in oriental
        literature. The librarian pointed out an ancient manuscript of the Latin Vulgate,
        called Codex Carolinus, and supposed to have been a present from Charlemagne
        ; but without foundation, for it is certainly of much later date, probably
        of the eleventh century. Among the rare books is the Latin Bible, translated
        by Pelican, Bibliander, and Leon Juda, printed at Zurich in 1545. "Zurich,"
        says Coxe, "notwithstanding its five centuries of literary illustration, has
        not made much progress in its judiciary administration, of which, being purely
        arbitrary, it is not very easy to give an account. The proceedings are carried
        on in secret, without any check as to the extent of the punishment inflicted
        but the conscience of the judge, or, what is worse still, a company of judges.
        The youngest judge inquires into the case and reports on it ; his decision,
        upon which the rank of the prisoner, his connexions, and the solicitations
        of his friends, are not without their influence, is generally adopted. Corruption
        here is never venal, and this is the most you can say in favour of their administration
        of justice. " The torture (flogging) was tdl very lately applied ad libitum,
        to extort the confession of the prisoner, which was deemed necessary to convict
        him ; but, in consequence of a late law passed in council, a special order
        of the court is now required in each particular case, prescribing the number
        of lashes ! It certainly seems very strange in this age to see a republic,
        first in rank in the Helvetic body, and deemed the Athens of Switzerland,
        passing laws for regulating the torture ! They are sensible of the abuse it
        is liable to, since they wish to limit the extent of it, yet do not see that
        the whole system is a gross abuse, as absurd as it is barbarous. During the
        French occupation of Switzerland, the administration of justice was subjected
        to a criminal code, from which the torture was excluded ; but when, in 1802,
        under the mediation of Buonaparte, protector of the Helvetic league, the restoration
        of the federal government took place, all the old abuses were carefully reinstated
        along with it, the mediator being well aware, that with the paternal government
        so constituted, he could do what he pleased with the family. The administration
        of justice in France, with all its imperfections, is much superior to that
        of most of the Swiss cantons. In Italy, the people talk with admiration of
        the Justizia Francese, as infinitely superior to their own : it is all comparative."
        The spirit of the citizens of Zurich is, however, displayed throughout the
        history of their canton. A great aptitude for business, an activity carried
        at some times to restlessness, a love of independence, a mercantile spirit
        not free from cupidity, a bravery often excited to rashness, a love of instruction
        with a tendency to cavilling, and liberality without profusion, have been
        pointed out as the qualities most conspicuous in their character. More open,
        frank independence, and more liberality of sentiment, are apparent at Zurich
        than in any other of the large towns of Switzerland. Its magistrates were
        respected for their integ rity7 and justice, and the other cantons paid a
        willing deference to their opinion in those matters which concerned the whole
        confederation. In their domestic dissensions and foreign disputes there have
        ever been found a vitality and energy in their public spirit which has repeatedly
        rescued them from destruction when they seemed to be tottering', 1]

        \ Asia may be considered as com mencing with its western countries, and writh\
        \ Greece, the cradle of our present civilisation. Judea and Ph\u0153nicia\
        \ are the quarters from which the earliest information comes. The Jews scarcely\
        \ recognised distinctly any object more easterly than the Euphrates, emphati\
        \ cally termed by them \" the river ;\" beyond which, at a vague and uncertain\
        \ distance, they placed \" the ends of the earth.\" Tyre traded with several\
        \ cities on its banks, but does not seem to have pushed her intercourse further;\
        \ though Dr. Vincent reasonably conjectures, that the chests of rich apparel,\
        \ carefully bound with cords, brought by this channel, were from countries\
        \ much more remote. A great traffic is mentioned with Dedan, a city of Arabia,\
        \ which, from its many isles, and its merchandise of precious cloths, must\
        \ have been in the vicinity of Ormuz, and have drawn these commodities from\
        \ India. They were transported, by large caravans, across Arabia to Edom or\
        \ Idumea, which was greatly enriched by this traffic. From the south of Arabia,\
        \ Sheba, or Sabea, sent caravans laden with gold and incense, both probably\
        \ obtained from the opposite coasts of Africa. The knowledge of the Greeks,\
        \ in the nearly cotemporary age of Homer, was far more limited. He seems to\
        \ have had no distinct knowledge of any country east of Asia Minor. Colchos,\
        \ on the Euxine, being supposed to contain the chariot of the sun, must have\
        \ been viewed as the eastern extremity of the earth : the voyage thither by\
        \ Jason, in the ship Argo, was regarded as an almost superhuman achievement.\
        \ The name Asia was then applied only to a part ofthe coast of Caria, whence\
        \ it was extended to the peninsula, and ultimately to the whole continent\
        \ ; after which the other was named the Lesser Asia.* The triumphant contest\
        \ of Greece with Per sia excited deep interest, and generated plans of conquest,\
        \ which rendered every information respecting that empire acceptable. The\
        \ most valuable contributor was Herodotus, who, during a residence at Babylon,\
        \ collected materials for a description of the satrapies into which it was\
        \ di vided. To the north it extended over a part of the Caucasian provinces,\
        \ enabling the writer to delineate tolerably the extent and boundaries of\
        \ the Caspian. Margiana and Bactria probably reached to the Oxus, beyond which\
        \ wandered the Scythian tribe named Massaget\xE6. India was the most easterly\
        \ satrapy ; but being described as containing no great river except the Indus,\
        \ and bounded by an immense desert, it evidently contained only the western\
        \ provinces, while the Gangetic and southern countries were entirely unknown.\
        \ Herodotus gives a somewhat rude description of the inhabitants, suggested\
        \ probably by the bordering mountaineer tribes. The fact of its affording\
        \ a revenue four times that of Egypt, shows clearly that it was already opulent\
        \ and improved. Darius is said to have employed Scylax, the Caryandrian, to\
        \ descend thelndus, sail along the southern coast, and come up the Red Sea\
        \ ; a voyage accomplished in two years, t The next great source of information\
        \ to the Greeks was the expedition of Alexander. It did not, indeed, extend\
        \ much beyond the al ready known limits of the Persian empire ; but the countries,\
        \ before known only by vague report, were then carefully examined and described.\
        \ Under his direction two engineers, Diognetusand Baeton, made surveys of\
        \ each march, which were published by the latter, but are unfortunately lost.\
        \ To the north, Alexander pushed beyond the Jaxartes, but without being able\
        \ to bring under subjection the rude tribes who tenanted those regions. On\
        \ the side of India, he learned the existence of the Ganges and the fine coun\
        \ tries on its banks, to which he eagerly sought to penetrate; but the mutiny\
        \ of his troops compelled him to stop at the Hyphasis. The Greeks had then\
        \ an opportunity of observing some of the pecu liarities of the Indian people\
        \ ; their division into castes ; their fantastical religious austerities ;\
        \ and the merit attached to suicide. Alexander de scended the Indus to its\
        \ mouth, and sent thence a tleet under Nearchus, who traced the coast of Asia\
        \ as far as the Persian Gulph, which he ascended, and joined his master at\
        \ Babylon. This voyage, now so easy, was then considered a most perilous achievement,\
        \ and the party arrived in a state of distress and exhaustion. Alexander himself,\
        \ in returning through the maritime provinces, be came aware of their extremely\
        \ desolate charac ter, through which, indeed, his army was in danger of perishing.\
        \ On the partition of Alexander's empire, Seleucus obtained Syria, with as\
        \ much of the countries to the eastward as his arms could hold in subjection.\
        \ He is said to have attempted the conquest of India; but there is no dis\
        \ tinct account how far he penetrated ; proba bly it was not beyond Alexander's\
        \ limit. He sent however an embassy, under Megasthenes, to Palibothra(Pataliputra)\
        \ on the Ganges, capital of one of the most powerful kingdoms ever fonnedin\
        \ India; and through this channel a good deal of additional information was\
        \ obtained. He also employed his admiral, Patroclus, in an at tempt to circumnavigate\
        \ Asia ; and rumour even represents him as having accomplished this vast circuit,\
        \ and entered from the northern ocean into the Caspian; but the manifestly\
        \ fabulous character of this report makes it impossible to conjecture how\
        \ far he really penetrated. All the materials thus collected were at the disposal\
        \ of Eratosthenes, the learned librarian of Alexandria ; and were employed\
        \ by him in forming, on the astronomical principles of Hip parchus, the first\
        \ systematic delineation of the globe. It is however, as to Asia, extremely\
        \ im perfect. The Ganges is made to fall into the eastern ocean, represented\
        \ as bounding the habitable earth. The Cape of the Coliaci (Comorin) is made\
        \ at once the most southerly and most easterly point of Asia. About ten degrees\
        \ north of the Ganges, and a very little east, is placed, in the same ocean,\
        \ the city of Thin\u0153, often alluded to as the extremity on that side of\
        \ the habitable world : this appears the first very imperfect rumour, which\
        \ reached the western nations of the Chinese empire. Not far from Thin\xE6\
        , the coast turned westward, stretching along the great northern ocean, which\
        \ bounds both Europe and Asia, but at so low a latitude that the Caspian was\
        \ considered to be a gulph connected with it by a narrow strait. This was\
        \ a retrograde step even from Herodotus, who had described it justly as an\
        \ inland sea. Asia, thus wanting Tibet, China, the greater part of Tartary,\
        \ and all Siberia, possessed little above a third part of its real dimensions.\

        \ by an artificial mound or causeway, called, from its length (7 stadia, 4270\
        \ English feet, or f of a mile), the Heptastadium. There were two breaks in\
        \ the Mole to let the water flow through, and prevent the accumulation of\
        \ silth; over these passages bridges were laid, which could be raised up at\
        \ need. The temple of Hephaestus on Pharos stood at one ex- tremity of the\
        \ Mole, and the Gate of the Moon on the mainland at the other. The form of\
        \ the Hepta- stadium can no longer be distinguished, since modem Alexandreia\
        \ is principally erected upon it, and upon the earth which has accumulated\
        \ about its piers. It probably lay in a direct line between fort Caffarelli\
        \ and the island. and W. by the region Rhacotis and the main street which\
        \ connected the Gate of the Sun with that of the Moon and the Heptastadium.\
        \ It was also sur rounded by its own walls, and was the quarter in which Caesar\
        \ defended himself against the Alex andrians. (Hirtius, B. Alex. 1.) The Brucheium\
        \ was bisected by the High Street, which ran from the Canobic Gate to the\
        \ Necropolis, and was supplied with water from the Nile by a tunnel or aqueduct,\
        \ which entered the city on the south, and passed a little to the west of\
        \ the Gymnasium. This was the quarter of the Alexandrians proper, or Hellenic\
        \ citi zens, thc Royal Residence, and the district in which were contained\
        \ the most conspicuous of the public buildings. It was so much adorned and\
        \ extended by the later Ptolemies that it eventually occupied one-fifth of\
        \ the entire city. (Plin. v. 10. s. 11.) It contained the following remarkable\
        \ edifices : On the Lochias, the Palace ofthe Ptolemies, with the smaller\
        \ palaces appropriated to their children and the adja cent gardens and groves.\
        \ The far-famed Library and Museum, with its Theatre for lectures and public\
        \ assemblies, connected with one another and with the palaces by long colonnades\
        \ of the most costly marble from the Egyptian quarries, and adorned with obelisks\
        \ and sphinxes taken from the Pharaonic cities. The Library contained, according\
        \ to one account, 700,000 volumes, according to another 400,000 (Joseph. Antiq.\
        \ xii. 2; Athen. i. p. 3); part, however, of this unrivalled collection was\
        \ lodged in the temple of Serapis, in the quarter Rha- cotis. Here were deposited\
        \ the 200,000 volumes collected by the kings of Pergamus, and presented by\
        \ M. Antonius to Cleopatra. The library of the Museum was destroyed during\
        \ the blockade of Julius Caesar in the Brucheium ; that of the Serapeion was\
        \ frequently injured by the civil broils of Alex- andreia, and especially\
        \ when that temple was de- stroyed by thc Christian fanatics in the 4th century\
        \ a. d. It was finally destroyed by the orders of the khalif Omar, A. D. 640.\
        \ The collection was begun by Ptolemy Soter, augmented by his successors,\
        \ \u2014 for the worst of the Lagidae were patrons of litera- ture, \u2014\
        \ and respected, if not increased, by the Cae- sars, who, like their predecessors,\
        \ appointed and sala- ried the librarians and the professors ofthe Museum.\
        \ The Macedonian kings replenished the shelves of the Library zealously but\
        \ unscrupulously, since they laid an embargo on all books, whether public\
        \ or private property, which were brought to Alexandreia, retained the originals,\
        \ and gave copies of them to their proper owners. In this way Ptolemy Euergetes\
        \ (b. c. 246 \u2014 221) is said to have got possession of authentic copies\
        \ of the works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, and to have returned\
        \ transcripts of them to the Athenians, with an accompanying compensation\
        \ of fifteen talents. The Museum succeeded the once renowned college of Heliopolis\
        \ as the University of Ecrypt. It contained a great hall or banqueting room\
        \ (oIkos peyas), where the professors dined in common; an exterior peristyle,\
        \ or corridor (7repi7rc.- toi), for exercise and ambulatory lectures; a theatre\
        \ where public disputations and scholastic festivals were held; chambers for\
        \ the different professors; and possessed a botanical garden which Ptolemy\
        \ Phila- delplms enriched with tropical flora (Philostrat. Vit. Apollon. vi.\
        \ 24), and a menagerie (Athen. xiv. p. 654). It was divided into four principal\

        \ into three regions. (1) The Regio Judaeorum. (2) The Brucheium or Pyrucheium,\
        \ the Royal or Greek Quarter. (3) The Rhacotis or Egyptian Quarter. This division\
        \ corresponded to the three original con stituents of the Alexandrian population\
        \ (rp'ta. yevrf, Polyb. xxxiv. 14; Strab. p. 797, seq.) After b. c. 31 the\
        \ Romans added a fourth element, but this was principally military and financial\
        \ (the garri son, the government, and its official staff, and the negotiatores),\
        \ and confined to the Region Brucheium. 1. Regio Judaeorum, or Jews' Quarter,\
        \ occupied the NE. angle of the city, and was encompassed by the sea, the\
        \ city walls, and the Brucheium. Like the Jewry of modern European cities,\
        \ it had walls and gates of its own, which were at times highly necessary\
        \ for its security, since between the Alexan drian Greeks and Jews frequent\
        \ hostilities raged, inflamed both by political jealousy and religious hatred.\
        \ The Jews were governed by their own Ethnarch, or Arabarches (Joseph. Antiq.\

        and distance of a mile from the village. An experiment made with a hydrant,
        with an inch pipe, showed that water could be thrown over the liberty pole
        on Factory Square, about 120 feet high, and the question appears to be settled
        beyond doubt that these valu able works will answer the end for which they
        were erected, and that the village will henceforth possess the means of controlling
        fires, which have so often in times past laid waste the most flou rishing
        portions of the place. A part of this improvement is to consist of a fountain,
        in the centre of the public square, on each side of which an oval park is
        to be laid out, and enclosed and planted with trees. The basin of the fountain
        is forty feet in diameter, and made of cut stone, and the jets will be supplied
        from a reservoir, one hundred and eighty feet above this level. Early in 1S52,
        measures were taken for supplying the village with gas light. Messrs. Walworth,
        Nason and Guild, had, by a village ordinance passed September 9, 1851, secured
        the exclu sive privilege of supplying the village with rosin gas for ten years,
        and on the 28th of Feb., 1852, an association, styled the Watertown Gas Light
        Company, was organized, with a ca pital of $20,000. In the same year the principal
        buildings in the business portion of the village were supplied, and during
        the summer of 1853, pipes were laid through many of the principal streets
        and to private houses. A proportionate addition was made to the manufactory,
        and these improvements will be ex tended as the wants of the public demand.
        Several social libraries have been formed in this town, the first of which
        was the Watertown Social Library, May 14, 1805; Wm. Huntington, Corlis Hinds,
        Hart Massey, Henry Jewett, and Daniel Brainard, trustees. The Farmer''s Instructor,
        was a li brary company, formed June 8, 1813, with Wm. Parkinson, Davis Doty,
        Cyrenus Woodworth, Cyrus Butterfield, Simeon Woodruff, and Ira Delano, trustees.
        It was located near the line of Rut land. The Watertown Franklin Library,
        formed Feb. 12, 1829, with Chas. E. Clarke, Ralph Clapp, John Sigourney, Daniel
        Lee, Isaac H. Bronson, Clarke Rice, Otis Colwell, Henry L. Harvey, Baker Massey,
        Alvin Hunt, Ira Brewster, and Win. Smith, trustees, had formed a collection
        of books, that were sold in February, 1834, when the society disbanded. The
        Young Men''s Association, was formed by the appointment of officers, Dec.
        3, 1840, and the adoption of a constitution, which provided for the annual
        election of a president, two vice presidents, a recording and a corresponding

        \ 751.), acquired at the capitulation of Alexandria, in 1801; the Townley\

        \ now, both for size and classification, this department will bear to be compared\
        \ with any mineralogical collection in Europe. The depart ment of zoology\

        \ the museum with stuffed representations of animals that may be seen alive\
        \ in the zoological gardens and in every menagerie. The collection of medals,\
        \ which has been accumulating since the foundation ofthe museum, consists\
        \ of about 20,000 coins, above 6,000 being purchased with the Hamilton collec\

        \ Sfato Estense, a 6tate of N. Italy, consisting of the united duchies of\
        \ Modena and Massa Carrara, principally in cluded between the 10th and ll:h\
        \ degs. oi\" N. lat. and the 44th and 45th of E. long. ; having N. Austrian\
        \ Italy; E. the N. delegs. ofthe Papal States; W. Parma, and a portion of\
        \ the Sardinian dom. ; and S. Tuscany and the Mediterranean. Area estimated\
        \ at 2,317 sq. m., and the pop. at 562,678. The N. part of this duchy con\
        \ sists ofa portion ofthe great plain of Lombardy ; the S. is traversed from\
        \ W.to E. by the Apennines, one of the summits of which in this duchy, M.\
        \ Cimone, rises to up wards of 6,500 ft. above the sea. The Po constitutes\
        \ a small portion only of the N. boundary ; next to it the principal rivers\
        \ are its affluents, the Panaro, Secchia, Crostolo, Enza, Sec ; which have\
        \ their sources on the N. slope oi the Appennines, and flow N. to the Po ;\
        \ and the Magra and Sercliio, which rise on the S. slope of the Appennines,\
        \ and fall into the Mediterranean. The cli mate differs on the different sides\
        \ ofthe mountains. On the N. it is similar to that of Parma and the Lnmbardo\
        \ Venetian kingdom ; snow falls and cold weather lasts for several weeks in\
        \ the winter ; while to the S. of the mountains the climate is like that of\
        \ Genoa, and the olive and orange flourish in the open air. The plain country\
        \ is very fertile, and abundantly watered by rivulets and canals. In the mountains\
        \ there are many peasant proprietors, but not in the plains. A gTeat evil\
        \ here, as in other parts of Lombardy, is the practice of the lords and the\
        \ possessors of lands in mortmain letting to middle men, who relet to metayers\
        \ ; under which tenure are all the lands of the duchy. The tenant furnishes\
        \ half the cattle, and the landlord the other half. Apparently there is not\
        \ a labourer's house in the country, all being metay ing farmers. (Arthur\
        \ Young's Trav. ii. 157.) The distribution ofthe land is much the same as\
        \ in the rest of the plain of Lombardy, where, according to Cha teauvieux,\
        \ very few farms exceed 60 acres. The me tayers should receive half the produce\
        \ for their labour and attention, but the actual quantity falling to their\
        \ share varies considerably according to circumstances, and in many cases\
        \ is not more than l-3d part of the crops produced. The custom of sharing\
        \ the produce is, however, almost universal ; and a lease at a fixed rent\
        \ being extremely rare, we need not wonder at the low state of industry. (Chateauvieux,\
        \ Italy and its Agric. p. 17., &c.) Rice, wheat, maize, fruits, wine, oil,\
        \ and hemp are the principal articles of culture ; but the supply of corn\
        \ is notwithstanding inadequate for the consump tion. The wine of the duchy\
        \ is strong, but not of su perior quality : the oil S. of the mountains is\
        \ equal to that of Genoa, but that produced in the N. plains is very inferior.\
        \ Bees, poultry, and hogs are numerous. Cattle breeding is not very extensively\
        \ pursued, except in the valley of Garfagnana, where it Is almost the sole\
        \ occu pation of the inhabs. The pasturages on the mountains are excellent\
        \ ; but only the duke and a few of the larger proprietors possess any considerable\
        \ flocks of sheep. Horses few; oxen of the Lombard and Swiss breeds, and asses,\
        \ supplying their place for draught, See, on almost every farm. The declivities\
        \ of the Appennines are clothed with fine woods of oak, beech, pine, and chest\
        \ nut ; indeed, chestnut flour forms the principal food of the peasantry in\
        \ the upland region for a considerable portion of the year. The labouring\
        \ classes, even in the more productive parts of the duchy, live very sparingly\
        \ ; soup of Turkish wheat, or polenta, salads, and beans or other pulse, fried\
        \ in oil, are their ordinary food. Butcher's meat scarcely ever appears except\
        \ on the tables of the more opulent farmers, and their best beverage is refuse\
        \ wine, or wine of the second pressure. Next in importance to rural husbandry,\
        \ is the culture and manufacture of silk, though the products be of indif\
        \ ferent quality. The other manufactures are on a small scale, f hey consist\
        \ principal ly of canvass, leather, paper, glass, and earthenware. * In Garfagnana\

        \ scale, and the editions of classical and other works printed at this establishment\
        \ are celebrated both for beauty and accuracy. The Bod leian library, founded\

        \ in the United Kingdom. It is said, however, to be of less utility than might\
        \ have been supposed. Owing to a justifiable apprehension of fire, the library\
        \ is very inadequately warmed, and is very uncomfortable in winter; and the\
        \ books are not allowed to be removed from the library. But though this be\
        \ a very proper regulation as respects the rare and more valuable works, all\
        \ the more common works might be lent out here as in Edinburgh, on lodging\
        \ a deposit equal to their value, without any loss to the library, and with\
        \ very great advantage to the students. The Radcliffe library, founded by\
        \ Dr. Radcliffe, in 17)8, and erected at an expense of 40,000/. is under private\
        \ trustees, and has little or no connection with the university. The books\

        \ This office, however, as well as that of the high steward or seneschal,\
        \ is little more than an honorary dignity con ferred on some distinguished\
        \ nobleman ; and the chan cellor's duties are ordinarily performed by the\
        \ vice chancellor, who is, in fart, the supreme executive and judicial authority\
        \ resident in the university. He is an nually selected by the chancellor from\
        \ the heads of houses, and approved by convocation; but in practice the office\
        \ is held for 4 years, and 4 deputies are appointed, called pro-vice-chancellors,\
        \ to take the duties of the office in case of the vice-chancellor's absence\
        \ or illness. The proctors (two masters of arts, of at least 4 and not more\
        \ than 10 years standing) are the conservators of the peace and discipline\
        \ ofthe university ; they rank next to the vice-chancellor, and have an extensive\
        \ police juris diction over the town. They are assisted in their duties by\
        \ four pro-proctors, and have at their command a large constabulary force.\
        \ They are annually nominated by the colleges, each college taking its turn,\
        \ according to a cycle fixed by the statutes. 1 he business of the uni versity,\
        \ in its corporate capacity, is transacted by the doctors and masters at large,\
        \ in two distinct assemblies, called congregation and convocation. The former\
        \ con sists of regents either necessary or ad placitum, including resident\
        \ doctors, heads of houses, professors and tutors of colleges, its business\
        \ being chiefly confined to the granting of degrees and dispensations : the\
        \ vice-chan cellor has a negative on its proceedings, and the proctors conjointly\
        \ have the same privilege. Convocation is the legislative assembly of the\
        \ university, comprising all doctors and masters resident or not, whose names\
        \ are on the books ofa college or hall; and its business is unlimited, extending\
        \ to all subjects affecting the credit, interest, and welfare of the corporate\
        \ body. The sta tutes, however, cannot be altered, nor any new laws be enacted,\
        \ before the matter has been referred to the hebdomadal meeting of the vice-chancellor,\
        \ proctors, and heads of houses, who, if they approve of the measure, draw\
        \ up the terms in which it must be promulgated in convocation. The hebdomadal\
        \ meeting was first insti tuted in the reign of Charles I. The public professorships\
        \ of Oxford are of 2 classes, those established by royal foundation, and those\
        \ sup ported by private endowment. The regius-professor ships of divinity,\
        \ civil law, medicine, Greek, and He brew, were founded by Henry VIII., and\
        \ canonries in. Christchurch cathedral are attached to the chairs of Divinity\
        \ and Hebrew. George I. also founded a regius professorship of modern history\
        \ in 1724, which was con firmed by George II. in 1728. There is also, as at\
        \ Cam bridge, a margaret-professor of divinity. The other professorships are,\

        \ assem blage of the rank and fashion of the county of Hampshire had gathered\
        \ together at Bloxdale Park, one of the most considerable estates in the immediate\
        \ vicinity of South ampton, and nearly adjoining the old ruins of Netley Abbey.\
        \ Tbe residence, familiarly known all over the county as Bloxdale, was one\
        \ of those old palatial buildings which the nobility have either not the money\
        \ now to build, or the taste and spirit of magnificence to inhabit. Its turrets,\
        \ towers, wings, and extensive outbuildings, made it, from any elevation from\
        \ which it could be well viewed, one of the most imposing features in the\
        \ surrounding landscape. A dense wood protected the whole domain from the\
        \ keen influences of the east winds ; and sloping towards the Southampton\
        \ Water, were meadows, and woods, and gardens of surpassing richness and beauty.\
        \ The stern winter, however, o our churlish climate had made in-doors at Bloxdale\
        \ much more desirable tban out ; and so in the magnificent grand saloon of\
        \ the mansion, we find some twenty or thirty gu\xBB sts assembled, who were\
        \ on a visit to the lordly owner of the domains. \"Keep her head a little\

        \ \" I'm afraid not.\" \" Hold on, it's coming now I\" A gust of wind seemed\
        \ to lift up the water as if by an invisible band. The boat dipped its starboard\
        \ bulwarks right under water, and the little sail, with a sharp crack, slew\
        \ to ribbons and disappeared in the darkness. There was one wild cry, and\
        \ Joe then shouted \u2014 \" He's over ! he's over 1 Hilloa I God, he is gone\
        \ 1\" The man whs had had charge ot tbe boat had been swept over to starboard,\
        \ and amid the seething roar of waters had disappeared. Any attempt to look\
        \ for him wonld have been as futile as to hunt for a particular grain of sand\
        \ upon the sea-shore. \" Lost I\" said Joe. \" One gone. Roots, where are\
        \ you?\" \" Here, in the water.\" \" In the water ?\" That visit had a special\
        \ object, too. Lord Francis Bloxdale, the only son and heir to the estate\
        \ and title of the earl, his father, was about to return from abroad, to take\
        \ up his permanent residence at the park. This young scion of nobility had,\
        \ in consequence of great weakness of constitution, been compelled to pass\
        \ a year or two in a more southern latitude than England. But now he was returning,\
        \ strong and well, and as be himself said in his letters, entirely free from\
        \ the constitutional delicacy that had beset hifh. \" Yes, at the bottom of\
        \ the boat. What has happened ?\" \" Never mind, old feller, it can't be helped.\
        \ We are going across, I think, somehow, with wind and current; but I can't\
        \ take upon myself to say where we shall land, or when.\" The skiff did better\
        \ now without her sail than she had done with it, for the current took her\
        \ across as she was steered a point or two against it, and a wave dashed the\
        \ little vessel high and dry upon the snow on the shores of the New Forest.\
        \ The inhabitants of the Park were : The Earl of Bloxdale, verging upon his\
        \ sixtieth year. The Countess of Bloxdale, aged forty, and a woman of what\
        \ is generally, in the world, considered tp be of strong understanding. Lady\
        \ Fanny Bloxdale, aged seventeen, of whom we shall soon hear more, and Morris\
        \ Courtley, the secretary librarian and cherished friend and companion of\
        \ the old earl. Another wave might have dragged the skiff back again, but\

        \ of the prisoner. A coroner's inquisi tion ensued, and a verdict of wilful\
        \ murder was returned against him. After that the magistracy committed him\
        \ for trial, and he stands here to answer for the offence. This was so evidently\
        \ intended to refer to the earl, that he slightly bowed, and then the attorney\
        \ general proceeded : \u2014 \" It appears that Lord Francis Bloxdale, the\
        \ unfortunate victim of whosoever com mitted this murder, was absent for a\
        \ consider able time from the parental roof; and it was to a greater degree\
        \ unfortunate, that during that time the health of the earl did not per mit\
        \ him to engage actively in the investiga tion of what was taking place around\
        \ him. It was, then, under such circumstances as these, that the prisoner\
        \ at the bar conceived the scheme of allying himself by marriage to the noble\
        \ bouse of which he was a dependant. \"Gentlemen of the jury, the first intima\
        \ tion that the heads of that house received of such being the fact, was through\
        \ the steward, Mr. Oxley, who made an accidental discovery to that effect,\
        \ and the consequence was, a degree of hostility upon the part of the prisoner\
        \ towards that individual of the most rancorous character.\" \" These, gentlemen\
        \ of the jury, are the circumstances precisely as they took place before the\
        \ eyes of numerous witnesses ; and as they were heard by more than half a\
        \ dozen persons, so these may be considered to be the notorious features of\
        \ the crime about which there can be no possible dispute. \" It will be, now,\
        \ my duty to detail to you more at length what can be given in evidence upon\
        \ the matter, with relation to antecedent and subsequent occurrences connected\
        \ with the murder. Of course what I in this address allege to you, I expect,\
        \ and believe, will be proved by competent witnesses on oath before you this\
        \ day. There was now a general look of intense expectation upon the faces\
        \ of all present, and even Morris Courtley himself seemed to feel a degree\
        \ of curiosity to know in what way the advocate would strive to account for\
        \ the supposed crime committed by him. The most profound stillness now reigned\
        \ in the court, so that, although, in truth, the attorney-general spoke in\
        \ rather a low tone, every word that he uttered was dis tinctly heard. \"\
        \ The prisoner at the bar, gentlemen of the jury, up to the very day, or,\
        \ rather, as we may say, up to the very night of the commission of the murder,\
        \ for which he is arraigned this day before you, held the position of secretary\
        \ or librarian to the Earl of Bloxdale, and he was considered to be a kind\
        \ of protege\" of the Bloxdale family, and highly esteemed by all, with tbe\
        \ exception of the late countess. \" That is false,\" said Morris Gouttley.\
        \ CHAPTER LIV. PUBLIC OPINION WAVEBS ABOUT THE QUILT OK INNOCENCE OP MOKRIS\
        \ COURTLEY. The tone in which Morris Courtley uttered these words produced\
        \ a vast sensation in court. The attorney-general looked astonished, and sat\
        \ down on the moment \u2014 the people swayed to and fro with excitement \u2014\
        \ and the judge held up his hands to command silence, as he said, \u2014 \"\
        \ Prisoner at the bar, you will receive from all here concerned a fair and\
        \ patient trial \u2014 it is my special duty to sit here and see tbat such\
        \ is the case ; but if the proceedings be interrupted by you or by any one\
        \ else, it will be, surely, obvious to you upon reflection, that it is very\
        \ doubtful if they will ever be ooncluded.\" \" My lord,\" said Morris Courtley,\
        \ \" I ac knowledge the justice of your reproof, and will be silent. It was\
        \ an impulse that I could not at that moment resist that made me speak.\"\
        \ \" It would appear that the countess, who is now no more, must have had\
        \ some suspicion that the conduct of the prisoner at the bar was not such\
        \ as it ought to be ; for you will hear it upon oath this day, that upon more\
        \ than one occasion that lady requested the earl to discharge the secretary,\
        \ but without effect. What special reason her ladyship had for making such\
        \ a request, we may, in the course of the inquiry guess, although she is no\
        \ longer in this world to depose to these facts herself. \" A glance at the\
        \ position of the Bloxdale family at, or about the period just antecedent\
        \ to the murder, will very materially help us to an appreciation of the circumstances\
        \ con nected more directly with the dreadful deed.\" At these words from the\
        \ attorney-general, the paleness of the countenance of the un fortunate Earl\
        \ of Bloxdale visibly increased, and he wore a look of distress tbat none\
        \ could fail to comprehend. The judge inclined his head, and then said, \u2014\
        \ \" Mr. Attorney-general, prsy proceed.\" The attorney-general rose again.\
        \ \"After the interruption I have received,\" he commenced by saying ; but\
        \ the judge interposed, in an under tone remarking, \u2014 \" I think that\
        \ the least that is said of that, now. will be the better.\" \" No doubt you\
        \ are right, my lord ; I wHl not allude to it further. The prisoner at the\
        \ bar, then, conceived, for I presume that is not direct, the idea of uniting\
        \ himself with Lady Fanny Bloxdale. How far he had succeeded in making that\
        \ very young lady a party to his plans, it is not our business to \" I hope,\"\
        \ added the attorney-general, \" that in what I have to say, I shaU be able\
        \ to exercise sufficient tact and prudence to avoid wounding the feelings\
        \ of those whom we must all commiserate and respect.\"", 1]
    - ["THE SECRETARY; OR, THE 166 i i Calm and tranquil as Morris Courtley was throngbout\
        \ this address, it had a great effect upon all hearers ; and his counsel nodded\
        \ with satisfaction at the conclusion of it. it is for you to draw your own\
        \ con clusions. \" The prisoner at the bar has an appointment to meet a man\
        \ at a very unsual hour, and at a very strange place. How this appointment\
        \ was biought about we have no ev direct. It may have been the suggestion\
        \ of Lord Francis himself, to get tho pi away without any show, or it may\
        \ have been that the prisoner suggested the plan, anel the hour of meeting,\
        \ on some pretence or another, in order to get bis victim to such a spot at\
        \ such a time. All eyes were now upon the judge, who slowly arranged his notes\
        \ ; and then in a voice which sufficiently indicated how deeply moved he was\
        \ by the doubts and fears tbat oppressed him, he summed up the case. \" Gentlemen\
        \ of the jury \u2014 \" The prisoner at the bar stands charged ' with the\
        \ wilful murder of Francis Bloxdale, commonly called Lord Bloxdale. It appears\
        \ | that the prisoner held the situation of secre tary and librarian to the\
        \ Earl of Bloxdale, and that he was greatly esteemed by the family, and admitted\
        \ to familiar communica- e tions with them. \" One thing is certain, that\
        \ there and then the murder was committed by the prisoner or someone else.\
        \ Then we have the evidence of the respected magistrate of the county, Mr.\
        \ Roachford, respecting the finding tha portion of the coat of the pi boner\
        \ at the bar in the grasp of the murdered man. It seems as if some struggle\
        \ had taken place between the victim and his murderer, and that in that struggle\
        \ the cost hud been torn. We are irresistibly led to that conclusion. 44 It\
        \ is my duty to tell you, gentlemen of the jury, tbat the evidence against\
        \ the pri soner at tho bar is circumstantial merely. No one saw him dn the\
        \ deed with whioh he stands charged; but if he did not do it, some one must\
        \ have been cognisant df the ap pointment between him and Lord Francis Bloxdale,\
        \ some one must have taken | sion of his coat, some one must have passed through\
        \ the hall where the gun hung, aud whieh it is pretty clear the pr; through,\
        \ and so, dogging his footsteps, and fathoming his almost every thought, the\
        \ real murderer, if it be not the prisoner at the bar, must have, with consummate\
        \ tact, made it appear to be him. 41 Gentlemen of the jury, I say again, it\
        \ is for you to decide upon all the questions which will naturally arise in\
        \ you minds in this truly disastrous affair. It is fitting and proper that\
        \ you should place due account upon the high character which the prisoner\
        \ has received from the Earl ot Bloxdale this day. It is sitting that you\
        \ should take into account his own bearing and appearance at this bar, and\
        \ given him the advantage and the full benefit of any doubt that may arise\
        \ in your minds regarding his guilt ; for better is it for twenty guilty men\
        \ to escape \u2014 ay, a hundred, even, than for one innocent man to perish.\"\
        \ The judge ceased, and then, as the jury rose to retire, the counsel for\
        \ the defence* said \u2014 *' The result of these familiar communica- tions\
        \ seems to be admitted on all hands to be an attachment between the prisoner\
        \ at the bar and Lady Fanny Bloxdale, the daughter of the respected earl of\
        \ that name, and sister of tbe murdered man. There is nothing, gentlemen of\
        \ the jury, in evidence \u2014 there is nothing by implication in the smallest\
        \ degree to cast a shadow of a stain upon the honour and fame of that young\
        \ lady. Gentlemen of the jury, I say this emphatically.\" A murmur of applause\
        \ ran through the court ; and John Oxley, who then found that the judge did\
        \ not believe a word of his machinations against Fanny, felt sick and faint.\
        \ Oh, how devoutly he wished that he had believed that the Bloxdale family\
        \ suffered enough without the attempts he made at the trial to increase that\
        \ suffering ! The grateful look that Morris Courtley gave to the judge for\
        \ saying those words of Fanny was truly beautiful to see. The judge continued\
        \ \u2014 \" It appears thai after the return of Lord Francis Bloxdale from\
        \ the continent, the fact of the attachment between the secretary and his\
        \ sister became known to him, by what means is of no consequence ; and thereupon\
        \ there ensued certain communications between him and the prisoner at the\
        \ bar, resulting in the arrangement by which he, the prisoner, was to leave\
        \ Bloxdale. \" The case for the prosecution, then, so far as motives to the\
        \ commission of the crime goes, resolves itself to this : That the pri soner,\
        \ finding the deceased lord so great an obstacle to his continuance at Bloxdale,\
        \ and his enjoyment of the society of the sister, and his ultimate hope of\
        \ making her his wife, foully murdered Lord Francis. \" After this, gentlemen,\
        \ come the events of that night \u2014 events which are only mysterious as\
        \ regards the simple fact of whether they lead in an undeniable manner to\
        \ a supposition of the guilt of the prisoner at the bar, or do not do so.\
        \ \" There seems to be no dispute about all the facts deposed to ; and under\
        \ such circum- 11 1 feel that it is rather irregular, ray lord, but I would\
        \ submit to your lordship this memorandum.\" The judge took the paper presented\
        \ to him, and after reading it, he said \u2014 Heaven forbid that we should,\
        \ upon any point of regularity or irregularity, (emit anything which is calculated\
        \ to throw a light upon a case jeapordising the life of a fel low-creature.\
        \ By tbis memorandum it ap pears that a pocket-book has been found", 1]

        to Welsh remains, I was shown a very old, and apparently valuable Irish manuscript

        this Celtic relic. The work is in small folio, written on vellum, in double

        the librarian, in formed me, was president of the Breton parliament, and died
        in 1746, this manuscript contains fragments of piety and of morality, several
        translations in prose and verse, extracts from the discourses of St. Ambrose,
        and also the genealogy of the ancient kings and principal families of Ireland

        \ 14th January, 1840, and all the debt of said Republic made receivable for\

        \ for or on account of such debts, should be filed in the Treasury Department,\
        \ before the President will be justified in issuing the second $5,000,000\
        \ stock to Texas.\" Besides this immense sum, the State owns nearly 200,000.000\
        \ acres of lands, and according to the census of the United Btates, the value\
        \ of real and personal estate liable to taxation was valued at $52,740,473.\
        \ The average annual expenses of the State government are about $100,000,\
        \ which is raised chiefly by a direct tax on assessments, and a capitation\
        \ tax. The military force of Texas consists of 19,766 men of all arms, of\
        \ which 1,243 are commissioned officers, and 1*1.518 non-commissioned officers,\

        \ with the act of 23d May, 1850, apportioning representation, Texas is entitled\
        \ to two representatives in the Congress of the United States. Education.\
        \ \u2014 Primary and common schools are established in the chief towns and\
        \ counties, and education is becoming universal and easy of attainment. The\
        \ State has a considerable bcIiooI fund, which is being constantly augmented\
        \ by grants and donations. The College of Ruler vi He has been liberally endowed\
        \ by the State, and is quite flourishing. Gal veston University is also in\

        \ its name from its principal river. On the division of Carolina into two\
        \ provinces this country fell to the lot of North Carolina. Between 1740 and\
        \ 1750 the eastern parts of the country were explored, and large grants of\
        \ land awarded for the service. No settlements however were made at this time.\
        \ At the commencement of tho French War in 1754, about fifty families were\
        \ located on the Cumberland River, but these were driven off by the Indians.\
        \ About the same time the Shawnees, who had lived near the river Savannah,\
        \ emigrated to the banks of the Cumberland and settled near the present site\
        \ of Nashville, but they also were driven away by the Cherokees. In 1755,\
        \ a number of persons settled themselves beyond the present limits of North\
        \ Carolina, and were the permanent colonists of Tennessee. In 1773, population\
        \ was found to have increased to a very considerable extent. In the succeeding\
        \ year a war broke out with the northern Indians residing across the Ohio,\
        \ and terminated by their suing for peace. The year 1776 was rendered memorable\
        \ by a formidable invasion of the Cherokees, whom the British had incited\
        \ to attack the infant settlements. The British superintendent had previously\
        \ made proposals to the Tennesseans to join the British standard, and sailing\
        \ to lure them from the support of the colonies, thus directed against them\
        \ the savage foe. A strong force from Virginia and the Carolinas, however,\
        \ soon dispersed the enemy, and peace was again restored. When the constitution\
        \ of North Carolina was formed in 1776, Tennessee (then the \"District of\
        \ Washington1') sent deputies to the convention. In 1730 the mountaineers\
        \ of the borders of North Carolina and Tennessee distinguished themselves\
        \ in the southern cam paign, at King's Mountain, Guilford, and other battle\
        \ scenes, and soon aster these events they penetrated the Indian country and\
        \ dispersed the savages. At the peace these brave men again sought their mountain\
        \ homes, and devoted themselves to the improvement of their settlements. About\
        \ this time, a small colony of about forty families, under the direction of\
        \ James Robertson, crossed the mountains, and settled on the Cumberland River,\
        \ where they sounded the town os Nash ville. The nearest white neighbors were\
        \ the settlers of Kentucky, and between them was a wilderness of 200 miles,\
        \ In 1783 the Legislature of North Carolina laid off a tract of land on the\
        \ Cumberland River for the discharge of the military bounties and the officers\
        \ and soldiers of the Continental Line. The district set apart included the\
        \ colony at Nashville, a small tract having been allotted to the original\
        \ settlers. After this period population began to increase rapidly. Many to\
        \ whom military lands had been granted repaired thither with their families,\
        \ while others sold their warrants to citizens of different States. In 17S5,\
        \ the inhabitants, feeling sensibly the inconveniences of a government so\
        \ remote as that at the capital of North Carolina, endeavored to form an independent\
        \ one, to which they gave the title of the ''State of Franklin,\" or Frankland,\
        \ but the scheme was ultimately abandoned. In 1789, the Legislature of the\
        \ State of North Carolina passed an act ceiling the territory, on certain\
        \ conditions, to the United States ; and in the following year Congress accepted\
        \ the cession, and by its act of 26th May, 1790, provided for its government\
        \ under the title of \"The Territory of the United States South of the Ohio,\"\
        \ which included the present States of Kentucky and Tennessee, the former\
        \ having been ceded by Virginia. In 1794 Tennessee was constituted a separate\
        \ territory. Two years afterward Congress passed an act enabling the people\
        \ to form a State constitution, which, having been adopted, was approved by\
        \ Congress 1st June, 1796, and Tennessee was admitted as a sovereign State\
        \ of the Union. Succession of Governors.\u2014 Territorial Governor : William\

        \ excess of expenditures over receipts of $9,166 77. The chief sources of\

        \ are executive, legislative, and judicial expenses, public print- ing, interests\

        \ a contingent liability, which arises from its endorsement by the State of\
        \ bonds of railroad companies to the amount of $1,100,000, but from this must\
        \ be deducted $13,000 for bonds not used, and $110,000 for bonds paid, which\
        \ reduces the amount for which the State may be liable, to $977,000. Since\

        \ Revolution, literature was hardly known in this State, much less a subject\
        \ of cultivation. There were in the province at the end of the royal government,\
        \ only two schools in operation, one at Newbern and one at Edenton. The constitution\
        \ of 1776, directed that \" a school or schools shall be established by the\
        \ legislature for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries\
        \ to the masters, paid by the public, as may enable them to instruct at low\
        \ prices; and all useful learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted in\
        \ one or more universities.\" Till within late years, however, no system of\
        \ free schools was introduced throughout the State. Liberal provision was\
        \ made for the purpose in 1825, by the creation of a school fund. This fund\
        \ now amounts to nearly half a million dollars, besides the income of stock\
        \ held by the State in several railroads, the proceeds of the sale of swamp\
        \ lands, and the tract acquired from the Cherokecs in the south-west. In order\
        \ to apply these funds, a Board of Literature was established in 1S37, to\
        \ devise a plan of common schools; but as yet nothing efficient for the increasing\
        \ population has been brought to fruition. At the present time there are some\
        \ 200 academies, and between S00 and 900 common schools in the State, at which\
        \ from 13,000 to 20,000 youth are annually taught. The principal collegiate\
        \ establishments in the State are the University, Davidson College, and Wake\
        \ Forest College. The University of North Carolina is located at Chapel Hill,\
        \ in Orange County, and in 1S50 had a president, 10 professors, and 230 students.\
        \ It was founded in 1759, and its alumni numbered 964, of which about 70 had\
        \ entered the ministry. It has an excellent library of 13,500 volumes. In\
        \ 1S53 a school of science and art was attached to it. In the law department\
        \ there were, in 1S50, ten students. Davidson College, sounded in 1835, is\
        \ situate in Mechleuburg County, and in 1850 had 4 professors, 60 students,\
        \ and a library of about 5,000 volumes, and its alumni num- bered 140, of\

        \ America was made in 1585 on Roanoke Island, in this State. The patron of\
        \ the infant colony was Sir Walter Raleigh, to whom Queen Elizabeth granted,\
        \ in 15S4, a patent for such lands as he might discover in America, \"not\
        \ possessed by any Christian people.\" The same year he dispatched two small\
        \ vessels to make discoveries, and these dropped their anchors early in July\
        \ in Ocracoke inlet. The adventurers landed on an island near Roanoke, called\
        \ by the natives Wococon, where they were received with every mark of hospi-\

        \ may become law notwithstanding. He is allowed a Secretary of civil and military\
        \ affairs, chosen by himself and paid by the State. Judiciary powers are vested\
        \ in a Supreme Court, consisting of a chief and two assistant justices; in\
        \ County Courts, or Courts of Common Pleas comprising four circuits, each\
        \ County Court being composed of one Judge of Circuit, elected by the Legislature,\
        \ who is ex-officio chief justice of the County Courts of his Circuit, and\
        \ two assistant judges for each county, elected by the people; and in Justices\
        \ of the Peace. The Supreme Court sits in each county once, and the County\
        \ Courts twice in each year; an additional term of the Supreme Court is also\
        \ held once a year in each district, at such time and place as the court may\
        \ order. Each Judge of the Supreme Court is Chancellor of a Circuit. The Court\
        \ of Chancery has two stated sessions annually in each county, and is always\
        \ in session for all purposes, except the final hearing of a cause. An appeal\
        \ from a decree of the Chancellor lies to the Supreme Court. Judges of the\
        \ Supreme Court, county and probate Courts, sheriffs, and justices of the\
        \ peace, are elected by the General Assembly in joint ballot. The Constitution\
        \ prohibits slavery, and permits imprisonment for debt only in cases of fraud.\
        \ It abolishes perpetuities. Every alien of good character coming to settle\
        \ in the State, and swearing allegiance thereto, is permitted to hold land.\
        \ By a law of 1850, a homestead of the value of $500 is secured from attachment\

        \ the Constitution within two years, six months' public notice being given\
        \ of the amendments proposed. The financial condition of this State is in\
        \ an enviable condition \u2014 the expenses of government are small, and its\
        \ lia- bilities insignificant. For the year ending 31st August, 1850, the\
        \ receipts into the treasury, including a balance from 1849 of $8,330, amounted\
        \ to $125,375, of which $91,309 was raised from taxes. The disbursements for\
        \ the same year amounted to $122,253, leaving a balance of $3,122. The principal\
        \ sums paid out, were the expenses of the Legislature, $36,043; executive\
        \ expenses, $2,618, and pay of judiciary and for prosecuting crime. $49,733.\
        \ The minor items of expense were those on account of elections, pauper relief,\
        \ common schools, agricultural societies, militia, etc. The expenses of 1S50\
        \ exceed those of 1349 by $7,767, but they embrace about $15,000 of extraordinary\
        \ expenditure. Vermont has no public debt. It has some temporary liabilities,\
        \ which at the above-named date amounted to $5S.036. Among the benevolent\

        \ of this college. It was founded on a donation of land, 20,000 acres, granted\
        \ in the reign of William and Mary. The buildings are of brick, and sufficient\
        \ to accommodate 100 students. It was formerly allowed a representative in\
        \ the General Assembly. Hampden-Sidney College was established in 1774, and\

        \ The observatory, a short distance from the university, is furnished wilh\
        \ the requisite astronomical instruments. The organization of the university\
        \ differs materially from that of any other institution in the Union. The\
        \ students are not divided into four classes, with a course of studies embracing\
        \ four years, but the different branches are Btyled \"schools,\" and the student\
        \ is at liberty to attend which he pleases, and graduate in each when prepared.\
        \ In order to attain the degree of M. A., the student must graduate in the\
        \ several schools of mathematics, ancient languages, moral philosophy, natural\
        \ philosophy, chemistry, and in some two of the modern languages. This institution\
        \ is in every respect organized, aud justly regarded as a university of the\

        \ South Carolina, for many years after its settlement, was united under the\
        \ same government as North Carfflina; but as early as 1671 it had been set\
        \ off as the \" County of Carteret in Carolina.\" and in 1715 had a sep arate\
        \ legislature. In 1727 it became a royal colony. The general history of the\
        \ colony, from its first settlement to the division of Carolina into North\
        \ and South, is given in connection with the description of North Carolina\
        \ (which see). The germ of the population of South Carolina was planted at\
        \ Port Rnyal in 1670, but becoming dissatisfied with the locality, the colony\
        \ removed the next year to the banks of Ashley River, where they founded old\
        \ Charleston. A second removal took place in 1630 to Oyster Point, at the\
        \ con fluence of Ashley and Cooper rivers, where the present city of Charleston\
        \ was commenced. On the settlement of South Carolina, the proprietors engaged\
        \ the celebrated John Locko to frame for them a constitu tion and body of\
        \ laws. The system of government proposed by the philosopher consisted of\
        \ 120 articles, and was partly aristocratic and partly feudal in its principles.\
        \ Three classes of nobility were established, viz., barons, caciques, and\
        \ landgraves. The first were to possess 12,000, the second 24.000, and the\
        \ third 4S,000 acres of land, which was to remain unalienable in their families.\
        \ The legislature consisted of only one house, and was composed of the lords\
        \ proprietors, the nobility, and deputies chosen by the free inhabitants holding\
        \ heritable property. This plan of government, ill suited to the condition\
        \ and views of the people, produced discord and anarchy. Its spirit was adverse\
        \ to a democracy, and encour aged the proprietaries in arbitrary proceedings.\
        \ Religious disputes, however, at this time, were the great causes of disturbance.\
        \ The Episcopalians being in a majority, attempted to exclude dissenters from\
        \ the legislature, aud the at tempt succeeding, the Church of England was\
        \ established by law. A train of evil consequences followed ; and though the\
        \ obnoxious law was annulled by the British Parliament, tranquillity was not\
        \ restored, and soon after (1729) the people preferring a monarchy to an oligarchy,\
        \ the colony became a royal government, the king purchasing the rights of\
        \ the proprietaries. From this period the colony was governed on the same\
        \ plan as the other royal governments, and its growth became more rapid. Population\
        \ began to pour in when discord subsided. The Dutch expelled from New York,\
        \ the French Protestants, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantz, and others\
        \ fleeing from tyranny and opposition, sought asylum in ihe young colony These\
        \ generally settled themselves on the Santee River, and perhaps more by their\
        \ respectability and character than by their numbers, contributed to the future\

        \ Government. \u2014 Georgia's first constitution was made in 1777 ; a second\
        \ in 1785, and the one on which the present government is based, in 179S.\
        \ It has subsequently undergone numerous amendments. Every citizen of the\
        \ State, 21 years old, who has paid all taxes demanded fur one year, and has\
        \ resided in the county for six months next before an election, has the right\
        \ to vote. The legislature is styled the General Assembly, and consists of\
        \ a Senate and House of Eepresentatives, the members of both of which are\
        \ elected biennially. Eepresentatives (130 in number) must be 21 years old\
        \ and have been citizens of the State three years and of the United States\
        \ seven years next before the election ; senators (47 in number) are chosen\
        \ in districts, and must be 24 years old, and have been citizens of the United\
        \ States nine years. A census of the State is taken every seven years and\
        \ representatives apportioned in accordance with its results. The Governor\
        \ is chief executive: he must be 30 years old, and have been a citizen of\
        \ the United States twelve years and of the State six years, and be possessed\
        \ of 500 acres of land, or $4,000 in other property above all debts. He is\
        \ elected for two years by a popular majority vote, or in case there be not\
        \ a choice, then one of the two candidates having the highest number of votes\
        \ shall be elected by joint ballot of the General Assembly. In case of the\
        \ office becoming vacant, the chair is filled by the President of the Senate,\
        \ and after him by the Speaker of the House. The governor may veto a bill,\
        \ but two-thirds of both houses subsequently voting in favor of the rejected\
        \ bill, makes it law nevertheless. The executive officers of the government\
        \ of the State are\u2014 a Secretary of State, a State Treasurer, a Comptroller\
        \ general, a Surveyor-general, and a State Librarian. The Keeper of the Penitentiary,\
        \ Commissioner of the Deaf and Dumb, and State Printer, come under this head.\
        \ The Judiciary consists of a Supreme Court, Superior Courts, and courts of\
        \ inferior jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, for the correction of errrors,\
        \ consists of three judges, one of which is chief judge, elected by the General\
        \ Assembly for such term as the law may provide, and are removable upon address\
        \ of two-thirds of each house. The judges of the Superior Court are elected\
        \ for six years, with jurisdiction exclusive in criminal cases and in land\
        \ cases, and concurrent in all other civil cases. Justices of the inferior\
        \ courts are elected by the people in districts. All judges have fixed salaries.\
        \ The State is divided into thirteen circuits with a judge for each, viz.\
        \ : Northern, Eastern, Southern, \"Western, Middle, Ocmulgee, Flint, Chattahoochee,\
        \ Cherokee, Coweta, South-western, Macon, and Blue Bidge. Savannah and Augusta\
        \ have special courts of Oyer and Terminer. Each county elects an \u2022'\
        \ ordinary,\" who holds office for four years, and has the ordinary jurisdiction\
        \ of a judge of probate. Sheriffs are appointed for two years, but not for\
        \ two terms in succession. On the institution of slavery, the constitution\
        \ provides, that \"There shall be no importation of slaves from Africa or\
        \ any foreign place after October 1st, 179S, nor shall the legislature have\
        \ power to free slaves without the owner's consent, or to prevent immigrants\
        \ from bringing with them persons deemed slaves by any one of the United States.\
        \ Slaves are protected in their persons, like free white persons, except in\
        \ case of insurrection, and unless their \" death should happen from accident\
        \ in giving such slaves moderate correction.\" Amendments to the constitution,\
        \ if passed by two-thirds of each house, shall be published six months before\
        \ the next election of members of the General Assembly ; and if passed in\
        \ the same manner at the first session thereafter, shall be adopted. The militia\
        \ of Georgia consists of TS,699 men of all grades and arms, of which 5,050\
        \ are commissioned officers, and 73,049 non-commissioned officers, musicians,\
        \ and privates. Of the commissioned officers 39 are general officers, 91 general\
        \ staff officers, 624 field officers, and 4,296 company officers. The State\
        \ benevolent institutions are an Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, under the management\
        \ of commi^ioners, and another for Lunatics, in the hands of trustees. Finances,\
        \ Debt, etc.\u2014 The balance in the treasury on the 20th October, 1?49,\

        \ fiscal year amounted to $355,226 9S\u2014 total means for the year $709,924\
        \ 50. Disburse ments for the same period $355,440 00, and balance remaining\
        \ $354,4S4 50 ; less unavailing for execution warrants $286,746 00, leaving\
        \ an actual balance of $67.73S 50. The public debt of the State amounted to\
        \ $1,829,072 22, and the bonds have from 18 to 20#years to run. Of this sum\
        \ $72,000 are in sterling bonds, sold to Messrs. Eeid, Irving & Co., of London,\
        \ England, and the remainder Federal bonds. The semi-annual dividends, as\
        \ well as the principal of the sterling bonds, are payable in London. The\
        \ whole annual interest on the debt is $110,223 33. A committee of the legislature\
        \ appointed to examine the State accounts in 1851, recommended that the balance\
        \ then in the treasury should be applied to the redemption of the sterling\
        \ bonds, and the State has a sinking fund for the ultimate redemption of the\
        \ whole debt as it becomes due. The chief sources of income are the general\
        \ tax and a special tax on bank stock. The principal items of expenditure\
        \ are the pay of the legislature biennially, about $65,000, of the civil establishment,\
        \ including judiciary, annually, about $45,000; the support of the Deaf and\
        \ Dumb Asylum, about $17,000; printing, an annual average of about $6,000,\
        \ and miscellaneous expenses, about $12,000 annually. The items of interest\
        \ on and reduction of the debt are additional to these. The assessed value\

        became scattered among those of its members who were probably the best readers,
        and finally went out in darkness. The town depended on the " light of nature,"
        and the use of pri vate libraries, from this date till the organization of
        the present library in January, 1850. This library was organized on a different
        principle from either of the others, and thus far has prospered be yond any
        former experiment. By its rules every book is to be re turned to the library
        on the first Thursday of each month under severe penalty, so that each member
        may know, that at each succeed ing monthly meeting all the books will be in
        the library. The use of the books each succeeding month, is then put up at
        auction, and struck off to the highest bidder. A fund is thus raised without
        in convenience to the members, sufficient without taxation, which for some
        reason is always odious, to make a fine addition of books to tbe library at
        each succeeding annual meeting. It has been incorporated as a body politic
        and corporate under a public statute of this state, enacted for such purpose,
        and is thus enabled to carry its regulations into effect. Its corporate name
        is the Woodbury Library Associa tion, and it has about 300 volumes of well
        selected books on various subjects of interest, civil, ecclesiastical and
        miscellaneous. Its officers are Rev. Lucius Curtiss, president, William Cothren,
        treasurer and librarian, and Lucius Curtiss, AVilliam Cothren, George Drakeley,
        Garwood II. Atwood and John E. Strong, executive com mittee. Its influence
        has been for good, and has induced an increas ed desire for reading useful
        books. There is no reason to doubt, that if the present system is strictly
        followed, there will be, in a few years, a library of which the town may well
        be proud. In the spring of 1778 or 1779, an occurrence took place at Guern
        sey Town, which is thus related by Barber in his Historical Collec tions of
        Connecticut : " A robbery, which at the time caused considerable excitement
        in the com munity, took place in the east part of the parish of Bethlem, called
        Guernsey Town, in the spring of the year 1778 or 1779, at the house of Ebenezer
        Guern sey, a wealthy fanner. Mr. Guernsey had sold his farm some time before,
        to Isaac Baldwin of Woodbridge, who had moved in with Mr. Guernsey, and had
        paid him a large sum of money. Mr. Guernsey had a number of men in his employ
        in building a house on an adjoining farm. All in the house had retired to
        rest.it being late at night, except Mr. Baldwin and wife, and two young men
        who were in another room. Two of the robbers came in, their faces being blackened,
        one being armed with a gun, the other with a pistol, and ordered Mr. and Mrs.
        Baldwin into the room where the young men were, to be bound,', 1]

        his arm. Lettice blushed, but she did not repel the familiarity. " You do
        not answer me, Lettice; speak !" " Yes, yes ! were you not always my friend,
        ever since I was a wee child, and you rescued me from Sir James Clare''s great
        mastiff, Tar tar ?" replied the young girl hastily, as they passed through
        the window and descended to the terrace. No opportunity was there then to
        continue so interesting a conversation, for Cyrus Eve lyn and Miss Sedley
        were at the foot of the flight of steps. The old librarian raised his hat,
        as his custom was, to his fair young mis tress, and then looked earnestly
        at Colonel Gower. The moment the officer spoke, Cyrus Evelyn recognised him,
        and gave him a hearty greeting, as much for Lettice''s sake as for his own.
        It was the same with Miriam Sed ley ; she was obliged to turn away hastily
        to conceal the emotion Colonel Gower''s appear ance caused her. She was so
        pleased on her dear pupil''s account that he looked every inch', 1]

        \ she was the girl to go through the world bravely. And the old man bore up\
        \ amazingly \u2014 so the people said, at least ; and Cyrus Evelyn, as he\
        \ lost sight of them at a turn in the road, felt rejoiced that his old friend\
        \ had borne the separation so firmly, and trudged homewards more hopefully\
        \ than he had come. Not all the way on foot, however; for Mr Burr, in his\
        \ gig, overtook him about a mile from Staunton, and gave him a ride to the\
        \ lodge-gate : for even Mr Burr respected Cyrus Evelyn \u2014 less for his\
        \ goodness probably than for his scholarship. Miss Sedley and Lettice were\
        \ Avalking in the gardens as Mr Evelyn came up from the Park. Flossy spied\
        \ him first, and came bounding across the grass, and barking vocife rously,\
        \ to meet him; Lettice and her gover ness turned too. Lettice looked with\
        \ astonish ment at the librarian's dusty garments, and asked him where he\
        \ could have been so early to get himself in such a state of dust. \" To Staunton,\

        and away into the library to old Cyrus Evelyn, whom, since the arrival of
        Mr Gower, she was conscious of having neglected. To her great surprise she
        found the young officer standing with his back to the fire, deep in a discussion
        with the librarian. Whatever the subject of their discussion might be, it
        ceased immediately she made her appearance, and Mr Gower came forward to meet
        her, calling her " early bird," " fairy," and all sorts of pretty and appropriate
        names. " Well, John is away to the barracks an hour since to fetch Rouser,"

        \ object the annihilation of the Ottoman empire, and continuing its deliberations\
        \ for nearly a year, will best be seen by the following few words of Pius\

        \ pia, a paucis est exaudita, non credentur pericula quae sunt pericula, quae\
        \ sunt ah oculis longius posita.\" But to proceed. Feared by the Turks and\
        \ beloved by his subjects, Matthias was bent upon adorning his court with\
        \ arts and letters. His regal palace was soon enriched by the works of renowned\
        \ sculp tors, in addition to a library containing fifty thou sand volumes,\
        \ which were continually added to by valuable manuscripts, which he caused\
        \ to be copied in the city of the Medici, as well as in other parts of Italy.\
        \ In short, Buda enjoyed its golden age, glittering in the splendour of a\
        \ chivalrous and joyous monarch, whose court was filled with foreign ambassadors\

        \ did not undertake the defence of the whole number, being all equally in\
        \ want of his advocacy. 1 Among the foreign men of letters, especially Italians,\
        \ called by Matthias to Buda, were Carbo, Naldi, Galeotti, the chief librarian,\
        \ and Bonfin, the well-known historian and panegyrist of Matthias. Of the\

        \ It is in this manner that we are to explain the dispa raging sentiment connected\
        \ by Horace and others with the idea of a cyclic writer, though no such sentiment\
        \ was implied in the original meaning of the Epic Cycle. The poems of the\

        \ cyclicus (Horat. Ars Poetic. 136), which was not originally implied in the\
        \ name, is well set forth by Lange (Ueber die Kyklisch. Dicht. p. 53-56).\
        \ Both Lange (p. 36-41) however and Ulrici (Geschichte des Griech. Epos, 9te\
        \ Vorles. p. 418) adopt another opinion with respect to the cycle, which I\
        \ think unsupported and inadmissible, \u2014 that the several constituent\
        \ poems were not received into it entire (i. e. with only such changes as\
        \ were requisite for a corrected text), but cut down and abridged in such\
        \ manner as to produce an exact continuity of narra tive. Lange even imagines\
        \ that the cyclic Odyssey was thus dealt with. But there seems no evidence\
        \ to countenance this theory, which would convert the Alexandrine literati\
        \ from critics into logographers. That the cyclic Iliad and Odyssey were the\
        \ same in the main (allowing for corrections of text) as the common Iliad\
        \ and Odyssey, is shown by the fact, that Proclus merely names them in the\
        \ series without giving any abstract of their contents : they were too well\
        \ known to render such a process necessary. Nor does either the language of\
        \ Proclus, or that of C\xE6cius as applied to Zenodotus, indicate any transformation\
        \ applied to the poets whose works are described to have been brought together\
        \ and put into a certain order. The hypothesis of Lange is founded upon the\
        \ idea that the (d_oXot* 8ia npaypdraxv) continuity of narrated events must\
        \ necessarily have been exact and without break, as if the whole constituted\
        \ one work. But this would not be possible, let the framers do what they might\
        \ : moreover, in the attempt, the individuality of all the constituent poets\
        \ must have been sacrificed, in such manner that it would be absurd to discuss\
        \ their separate merits. The continuity of narrative in the Epic Cycle could\
        \ not have been more than approximative,\u2014 as complete as the poems composing\
        \ it would admit: nevertheless it would be correct to say that the poems were\

        \ impossible to expunge. To persecutions and to the expulsion of the Jews\
        \ from Spain, after 1491, the extinction of the most precious Hebrew exemplars\
        \ may be, in part, attributed ; for Muslim intolerance had never know ingly\
        \ laid the hand of sacrilege upon documents which Christian charity has for\
        \ ever destroyed. (200) Mohammed had built up his Eur'dn upon the monotheistic\
        \ foundations of Moses; (201) and his faithful disciples have been always\
        \ too consistent, whatever barbarities they may have inflicted upon the Jews,\
        \ to injure that chosen people's sacred books, and thereby stultify themselves.\

        \ the jealous artifices of Eusebia39 herself, who, on this occasion alone,\
        \ seems to have been unmindful of the tenderness of her sex and the generosity\
        \ of her character. The memory of his father and of his brothers reminded\

        \ from him some recommendatory letters ; and, erasing the whole of the contents,\
        \ except the signature, filled up the vacant parchment with matters of high\
        \ and treasonable import. By the industry and courage of his friends the fraud\

        \ with a pen in his right for noting down his ob servations. The countenance\
        \ is that of a remarkable man \u2014 energetic, firm, intelligent. After glancing\
        \ at the books and portraits, we asked for the precious curiosities that are\
        \ kept under lock and key ; and first, we were shown the sword of the redoubtable\

        \ import, which the hero's sword is supposed to pronounce. An ancient missal,\
        \ for the use pro bably of the friars, and an aged prayer-book for the use\
        \ of the laity, marked qficium on the back, were next produced. They are printed\

        \ : some of it is as good as the most skilful lawyer's clerk would have put\
        \ out of hand, and a portion of it almost like printing. AVhile looking at\
        \ the objects, I placed my handbook on the table, and the librarian took it\
        \ up and glanced over its pages, but speedily put it down again ; he had evidently\
        \ met with one of Mr. Ford's sarcastic passages, which did not suit his Sevillian\
        \ taste. On leaving the library we crossed the court of the oranges, and set\
        \ off on a long walk to the Museum, or collection of pictures, &c. As it was\
        \ not Sunday, which is the open day for the public, I had, before I reached\
        \ my object, to get a ticket, which is easily obtained by showing your card,\
        \ or, as it happened in my case, your passport. The building which serves\
        \ as the Museo of Seville was formerly the convent of La Merced, of the order\
        \ of liominicans, so noted for their power and rapacity, and presents an appearance\
        \ very different from that it had about twenty years ago. The suppression\
        \ of the convents took place in 1836, and was accompa nied, or preceded, by\
        \ many a tragic scene. Sly guide, who then lived at Malaga, well remembered\
        \ the period, and told me that the infuriated popu lace pitilessly massacred\
        \ the friars, slaughtering indiscriminately good, bad, and indifferent. Barcelona\
        \ and Madrid, he said, presented the most frightful scenes of butchery and\
        \ bar barity. In the broad passage as you enter, in the patio, and in what\
        \ was the church of the convent, are deposited monumental stones with inscriptions,\
        \ large amphor\xE6, and, in short, many stony relics, that have been brought\
        \ from Italica. In the church, too, are casts from well-known ancient sculptures\
        \ preserved in Italy \u2014 the Apollo, the Venus, and the Laocoon in his\
        \ \"all-eternal throes.\" The arrangement of the pictures, I may mention,\
        \ has been altered, and pro bably improved, since the Handbook of 1847 was\
        \ published. Descriptions But perhaps the most interesting object of all was\
        \ the letter-book of Columbus. In it there was a most beautifully written,\
        \ or almost printed, copy of a letter he wrote to Ferdi nand and Isabella\
        \ the Catholic, from some part of the New AVorld. It was headed \" Carta del\
        \ Almyrate (the n omitted) al Rey y a la Reyna.\" In the same volume were\
        \ extracts from the Psalms, Isaiah, and other parts of the Scriptures, and\
        \ his essays or reflections after meditating on them, also his astronomical\
        \ and other scientific observations. These things, be it remarked, were all\
        \ in his own handwriting, and the volume appears to have been his letter,\

        our work. We are, nevertheless, sufficiently aware that it is in many respects
        defective ; but had we deferred its publication till these defects were removed,
        it would never have appeared. Some of them are in- herent in the nature of
        the subject ; and though additional experience and observation might afford
        the means of obviating others, new defi- ciencies would be sure to disclose
        themselves in the interval. Per- fection is as unattainable in works of this
        description as in other things. We have, however, done our best, with the
        assistance of such means and instruments as we could command, faithfully to
        represent the state of the country ; and by exhibiting the principal circumstances
        which have contributed to accelerate and to retard its progress in wealth
        and refinement, to show how its advancement, and the well-being of the population,
        may be best provided for in time to come. Unless they are made subservient
        to this end, descriptive and statistical details are of comparatively little
        value. In those departments of the work in which the author was but little
        familiar, he sought the co-operation of others. Thus the articles on the geology
        of England, Scotland, and Ireland, were contributed to the first edition of
        the work by the late Mr. Bakewell ; and they have been revised and mostly
        rewritten for this edition by Sir Henry de la Beche and Mr. Maclaren. The
        article on the climate of England is by Dr. Copeland, the learned author of
        the Medical Dic tionary ; and that on botany is by Sir William Jackson Hooker.
        The article on zoology was written for the first edition by William Swain
        son, Esq. ; but it required and has received much alteration in this edition.
        The chapters in the former editions on the English constitution and courts
        of law, were contributed by F. Forster, Esq., A.M., Barrister-at- Law. Except,
        however, in mere matters of detail, the chapters on these important subjects
        in this edition have very little in common with those of Mr. Forster, who
        is no longer in any degree responsible for them. William Farr, Esq., of the
        office of the Registrar-General, is the author of the elaborate and very valuable
        article on Vital Statistics. Dr. Irving, Librarian to the Faculty of Advocates,
        Edinburgh, has contributed the chapter on the Origin and Progress of the Eno-lish
        Language. We have also been greatly indebted to other parties. Our esteemed
        friend Mr. G. C. Lewis, procured for us many important statements ;', 1]
    - ["PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. In the preface to the first edition of this\
        \ work we made the following statements : \u2014 \" It has long been matter\
        \ of surprise and regret to many, that there should be no modern work exhibiting,\
        \ within a moderate compass, the physical capacities, population, industry,\
        \ and institutions of the British empire. The latest work of the kind that\
        \ has attracted any notice is the State of Great Britain and Ireland, by Chamberlayne,\
        \ the last edition of which was published so far back as the reign of George\
        \ II- But, though this once popular publication contains a good deal of useful\
        \ information, it is not written on any scientific plan, nor with any considerable\
        \ discrimination ; while the change of circumstances, since the peace of Paris,\
        \ in 1763, would have rendered it, how good soever it might originally have\
        \ been, quite obsolete for many years past. The want of any separate publication\
        \ on the state of the empire has been but indifferently supplied by the notices\
        \ of it in other works. Speaking generally, geographical science in this country\
        \ has been, until very recently, at the lowest ebb, while during the long\
        \ interval between Sir William Petty and Dr. Beeke, statistical science could\
        \ hardly be said to exist. Hence the accounts of Great Britain and Ireland,\
        \ in our encyclop\xE6dias and geographical works, are, for the most part,\
        \ very meagre and defective. The article on England in the Edinburgh Encyclop\xE6\
        dia, written by the late William Stevenson, Esq., Librarian to the Treasury,\
        \ is undoubtedly the best of this class of publications. The space allotted\
        \ to it was, however, too confined ; so that some important subjects, such\
        \ as those relating to population, education, the poor, revenue and expenditure,\
        \ army and navy, &c, are disposed of in the briefest and most unsatisfactory\
        \ manner. The accounts of agriculture and manufactures are the best parts\
        \ of the article, and are superior to any that had appeared when it was printed\
        \ in 1815.", 1]

        \ kindness and attention in this town; where he visited two public libraries\
        \ and the private one of Dr. Bodel Nyenhuis. In the LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY\
        \ he received many proofs of that kindness and politeness for which the much\
        \ lamented principal librarian Prof. Geel was so generally known. The books\

        were made. The author is at a loss to find adequate terms for the expresGon
        of his feelings towards Dr. Bodel, for the kindness and attention shown to
        an entire stranger, who was hardly able to give a clear idea of his purpose.
        That learned gentleman placed his valuable private library at the author''s
        entire disposal, selected for him all the materials he required, assisted
        him or left him alone with equal zeal and delicacy. Dr. Bodel''s library consists
        chiefly of maps, and furnished the greater portion of the materials for the
        Essay on that subject; but it possesses also some good books of reference
        which the author gladly made use of, and a few very rare tracts, amongst them
        the Plokhoy described in the Essay. AT AMSTERDAM: The library of the Institute
        contains also a collection of pamphlets. Its librarian, the late Prof. W.
        Vrolik, allowed the author special facilities of research. Here about 4000
        publications were examined, but with less attention than the author generally
        paid to his subject, as his mind was then suffering under a recent and most
        severe affliction. Only one other collection, besides the above was examined
        in Amsterdam, that of Mr. Fr. Muller, embracing all the different classes
        of materials contained in the Essay : Books, pamphlets, maps and charts. The
        pamphlets that were gone through were not less than 8,000, the number of duplicates
        being here more considerable than elsewhere. By far the greater number of
        the books ( not pamphlets ) described in the Essay, and some valuable maps
        and charts were equally from this col lection. As to the thanks due for Mr.
        Muller''s personal assistance, it seems hardly becoming to express before
        the public the feelings of friendship. But it must be stated that without
        this assistance the Essay would never have been written. IN-', 1]

        scholars than to Americans, for the editors have generously distributed them
        to the greater public libraries in Europe. In the British Museum library they
        are all to be found. While so much has been done by citizens of New-York ,
        the citizens of the mother-country have done a good deal to forward the labours
        of the American historians. We have already mentioned the assistance afforded
        to Mr. Brodhead by the archivists at the Hague, among whom the late Mr. de
        Zwaan deserves to be specially mentioned. The completeness of the collection
        is in a great measure due to his enthusiastic zeal, as Mr. Brodhead himself
        has acknowled ged. A different but not less valuable aid is to be found in
        three essays on the history of New-Netherland, written in Holland by Lambrechtfen
        van Ritthem in 1818, Mr. Lauts in 1846, and Mr. Berg van Dussen Muilkerk in
        1 85 1. Although these three publications do not in the aggregate exceed 180
        pages their influence has been considerable. Lambrechtfen has had access to
        some manuscript documents which have since been lost, and he has the merit
        of having first indicated the principal printed books which the historian
        of New-Netherland must consult. Mr. Lauts has made use of some very im portant
        printed documents, which have escaped both Lambrechtsen''s and Mr. Brodhead''s
        attention. Much greater still is the merit of Mr. Berg van Dussen , a man
        of great talent , who has indicated and combined many scatte red scraps of
        valuable intelligence. It is only to be regetted that his researches do not
        extend beyond the beginning of the history of New-Netherland. Different from
        these efforts but not less valuable are those of Mr. F. Muller at Amsterdam,
        Mr. Campbell, the deputy librarian at the Hague, and Mr. Tiele, now librarian
        at Leyden. It is mainly owing to these gentlemen, and especially to Mr. Muller,
        that Mr. Lenox and the other American amateurs have become acquainted with
        the printed documents and have been able to col lect them. Ii may perhaps
        not be superfluous to observe that Mr. Muller has been obliged to purchase

        \ lating between the intoxication of passion and apathy. The existence of\
        \ an aristocratic class, whether legally privileged or not, seems to be in\
        \ dispensable to the existence of that dignity and re finement of manners\
        \ which is caught from the ha bit of mingling in a society mainly devoted\
        \ to the pursuit of pleasure, from familiarity with the pro ductions of art\
        \ and literature, and from early initi ation into the practical art of government.\
        \ On the other hand the existence of a middle class, wealthy, intelligent,\
        \ and numerous enough to teach its mem bers to pride themselves in a sturdy\
        \ consciousness of their own importance, even when their devotion to mere\
        \ money-making pursuits embues them with the egotism of minds immersed within\
        \ the circle of a narrow experience, seems requisite as a counter poise to\
        \ prevent the dignified elegance of aristo cratic manners from degenerating\
        \ into empty strut and effeminacy. What has been already stated in previous\
        \ chapters regarding the stored-up capital of Britain, its acquired skill\
        \ in the mechanical arts, its progress in art, science, and literature, and\
        \ the distribution of property and information among the different classes\
        \ of society, will have prepared the reader to estimate that balance of numbers\
        \ and in fluence among them which stamped their peculiar character on the\
        \ manners of the period now under review. electioneering influence ; their\
        \ household arrange ments had in consequence been organised on quite a different\
        \ footing from what had prevailed among the old nobility of England, a change\
        \ to which the growing centralization of power in the general government,\
        \ the increased force and improved discipline of the army, and the increased\
        \ strength and organization of the police had likewise con tributed. Trains\
        \ of armed dependants were no longer necessary to afford security, and could\
        \ not confer political power. The nobility and gentry had by these changes\
        \ been placed more upon a footing of equality, and the custom of placing young\
        \ gentlemen of good families on the domestic esta blishment of a nobleman,\
        \ with a view to their edu cation, had fallen into disuse. The inmates of\
        \ an aristocratical family, titled or untitled, holding household appointments\
        \ not of a menial character had become few in number. The chaplain kept his\
        \ ground throughout the greater part of this period : his office, at least\
        \ during the earlier part of the period, was not al ways a sinecure. In a\
        \ notice of the death and funeral of the Duke of Newcastle, in the Annual\
        \ Register for 1768, it is stated that his chaplain read prayers in the family\

        \ of the most pro minent peculiarities of the manners of the metro polis,\
        \ commencing with those of the highest class, proceeding to those of the middle\
        \ and lower classes, and winding up with a brief indication of the re action\
        \ of the manners and habits of those classes upon each other ; second, a statement\
        \ of the pecu liarities of the manners of provincial England ; third, of those\
        \ of Scotland ; and fourth, of those of Ireland ; the topics falling under\
        \ each of the three latter heads being arranged in the same man ner as those\
        \ belonging to the subject of metropolitan manners. A brief recapitulation,\
        \ indicating the broad massive features of national manners, com posed by\
        \ these details, and the amount and charac ter of their difference from those\
        \ of the age which preceded them, will close the review. The last trace of\
        \ the feudal nobleman seems to have disappeared in England before George III.\
        \ ascended the throne. The metropolis had become the head-quarters of the\
        \ nobility : their power and influence depended upon their footing at court,\
        \ not upon their authority over their tenantry. Their permanent establishments\
        \ were in London, or at such a distance as the excellence of the roads in\

        \ Mr. Reynolds, Fedow of Eton Codege, &c. \" In my middle age, at a particular\
        \ friend's house, I found a near relation of his, one Mr. Hutchins of Frome,\
        \ just come into England out of Spain, from Bdboa, where he had belonged to\
        \ the factory the better part of twenty years ; who, among other things, told\
        \ us that, while he was there, some time after the Protestants became entde\
        \ masters of Ireland, there came over to Bdboa an Irish Roman Cathode priest,\
        \ that knew neither English nor Spanish. When the person to whom he was recommended,\
        \ being at a loss what to do, brought him to the Engdsh factory, to see if\
        \ any one there understood Irish ; but to no purpose ; tdl some mountain Biscainers,\
        \ that used Bdboa market, coming to the house where he lodged, and talking\
        \ together, were perfectly understood by him, and on his accosting them in\
        \ Irish, he was as wed understood by them, to the great surprise of ad that\
        \ knew it, as wed Spaniards as Engdsh.\" This, it is true, seems a confirmation\
        \ of the affinity between those languages, that are evidently derived from\
        \ the same source ; viz., the Celtic, which may be styled the universal language\
        \ of the post-dduvian world, and a sister dialect of the Hebrew : \u2014 But\
        \ the foregoing anecdote has been strongly con tested, by a writer in one\
        \ of the magazines,1 who denies the fact ; asserting, that there is no affinity\
        \ between the Irish and Biscayan languages, and appealing to ad who have any\
        \ trade or intercourse with Biscay. Our Enquirer goes on to give an account\
        \ of the war of the Titans, and of the Cabiric 2 mysteries, which were by\
        \ that means introduced. He dweds considerably upon this subject, as being\
        \ the first known \xE6ra in the history of Europe, and therefore essential\
        \ to an enquiry into its language and inhabit-. ants. The result of his reasonings\
        \ upon this head is, that Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter were powerful princes,\
        \ sovereigns over a vast empde, compre hending ad Europe and great part of\
        \ Asia; that this empde existed long before those petty kingdoms of Greece,\
        \ that boasted such great anti quity ; that the Titans were masters of ad\
        \ the knowledge derived from the 1 \"Gentleman's Magazine\" for October, 1758,\
        \ p. 482. 2 \"In the course of this visit, Johnson and I walked three or four\
        \ times to Elles field, a village beautifully situated about three miles from\
        \ Oxford, to see Mr. Francis Wise, Radclivian librarian, with whom Johnson\
        \ was much pleased. At this place, Mr. Wise had fitted up a house and gardens\
        \ in a singular manner, but with great taste. Here was an excellent library,\
        \ particularly a valuable collection of books in Northern literature, with\
        \ which Johnson was often very busy. One day Mr. Wise read to us a dissertation\
        \ which he was preparing for the press, entitled ' A History and Chronology\
        \ of the Fabulous Ages.' Some old divinities of Thrace, related to the Titans,\
        \ and called the Cabiri, made a very important part of the theory of this\
        \ piece ; and in conversation afterwards Mr. Wise talked much of his Cabiri.\
        \ As we returned to Oxford in the evening, I outwalked Johnson, and he cried\
        \ out ' Sufflamina,' a Latin word which came from his mouth with peculiar\
        \ grace, and was as much as to say, ' Put on your drag-chain.' Before we got\
        \ home, I again walked too fast for him ; and he now cried out, ' Why, you\
        \ walk as if you were pursued by all the Cabiri in a body.' \"\u2014Thomas\

        perhaps they do not know poor things ! for really they are not considered
        any thing in Wales, with regard to their acquaintance with real ancient British
        pedigrees and arms ; though they may learn some new things lately made up.
        And indeed it is not believed they have even a Welsh man to fill the essentially
        Welsh office of Rouge Dragon, in the College of Arms, any more than they have
        a Welsh librarian in the British Museum, Avhere a learned Cambrian clergyman
        lately found, after a toilsome and expensive journey to the city of King Ludd,
        that though they have a treasure of Welsh MSS., there is not any Cymro in
        the charge of them, or any body Avho can even read their titles in that establishment
        of supposed superior information, and consequently Welsh scholars, Avho go
        up to read, may ask in vain for any particular Welsh MSS: as they knoAv not
        one from another, being too ancient, I suppose, for the English to care to
        be acquainted with their contents. They are therefore sealed books, and likely
        to remain so under the present ar rangements. Forgive this digression ; but
        although English yourself, you know our noble race, and can feel for the mortification
        we experience at having our ancient records thus ignored as if by simultaneous
        conspiracy, and while the valuable liter ature of the descendants of the Druids
        of Britain is suffered to lie useless merely for want of one Welsh scholar
        to take charge of them, thousands are expended in disinterring the mummies
        of Egypt, and decyphering the stones of Assyria. Perhaps you will be surprised
        that any number of persons could take all the trouble (and much more than
        I can write) to compose and execute this memorial Avithout a probability,
        scarcely a chance, of knowing Avhat will become of the fruits of this ingenuity
        of patriotism ; but you can scarcely have a conception of the deep undercurrent
        of nationality still existing in the Cymry. Carnhuanawc is the living type
        of the nation, one indestructible attachment is the master pas sion of his
        life ; and I do not think there ever was so pure a patriotism. Like the rest

        auxiliary to the mutually beneficial interests between the two countries.*
        In Monte Video, accommodation for travellers is naturally very limited, principally

        \ were stationary or retrograde, while the Latins were advancing with a rapid\
        \ and progressive motion. The nations were excited by the spirit of independence\
        \ and emulation ; and even the little world of the Italian states contained\
        \ more people and industry than the decreasing circle of the Byzantine empire.\
        \ In Europe the lower ranks of society were relieved from the yoke of feudal\
        \ servitude ; and freedom is the first step to curiosity and knowledge. The\
        \ use, however rude and corrupt, of the Latin tongue had been preserved by\
        \ superstition ; the universities, from Bologna to Oxford,84 were peopled\
        \ with thousands of scholars ; and their misguided ardour might be directed\
        \ to more liberal and manly studies. In the resurrection of science Italy\
        \ was the first that cast away her shroud ; and the eloquent Petrarch, by\
        \ his lessons and his example, may justly be applauded as the first harbinger\
        \ of day. A purer style of composition, a more generous and rational strain\
        \ of sentiment, flowed from the study and imitation of the writers of ancient\
        \ Rome ; and the disciples of Cicero and Virgil approached, with reverence\
        \ and love, the sanctuary of their Grecian masters. In the sack of Constantinople\
        \ the French, and even the Venetians, had despised and destroyed the works\
        \ of Lysippus and Homer ; the monuments of art may be annihilated by a single\
        \ blow, but the im mortal mind is renewed and multiplied by the copies of\
        \ the pen, and such copies it was the ambition of Petrarch and his friends\
        \ to possess and understand. The arms of the Turks undoubtedly pressed the\
        \ flight of the Muses : yet we may tremble at the thought that Greece might\
        \ have been overwhelmed, with her schools and libraries, before Europe had\
        \ emerged from the deluge of barbarism ; that the seeds of science might have\
        \ been scattered by the winds before the Italian soil was prepared for their\
        \ cultivation. The most learned Italians of the fifteenth century have confessed\
        \ and applauded the restoration of Greek literature, after Eevivalof a long\
        \ oblivion of many hundred years.85 Yet in that: country, and beyond the Alps,\
        \ some names are quoted; lta1** some profound scholars who, in the darker\

        \ Bologna contained 10,000 students, chiefly ofthe civil law. In the year\
        \ 1357 the number at Oxford had decreased from 30,000 to 6000 scholars (Henry's\
        \ History of Great Britain, vol. iv. p. 478). Yet even this decrease is much\
        \ superior to the present list of the members of the university. 85 Of those\
        \ writers who professedly treat of Hie restoration of the Greek learning in\
        \ Italy, the two principal are Hodius, Dr. Humphrey Hody (de Gr\xE6cis Illustribus,\

        \ most literary collections, and been dispersed, since the death of its noble\
        \ author. Por these I am indebted to that industrious bibliographer, Mr. O.\
        \ Kich, now resident in London. Lastly, I must not omit to mention my obliga\
        \ tions, in another way, to my friend Charles Folsom, Esq., the learned librarian\
        \ of the Boston Athen\xE6um ; whose minute acquaintance with the grammatical\
        \ structure and the true idiom of our English tongue, has enabled me to correct\
        \ many inaccuracies into which I had fallen in the composition both of this\
        \ and of my former works. From these different sources I have accumulated\
        \ a large amount of manuscripts, of the most various character, and from the\
        \ most authentic sources ; royal grants and ordinances, instructions of the\
        \ court, letters of the Emperor to the great colonial officers, municipal\
        \ records, personal diaries and memoranda, and a mass of private correspondence\
        \ of the principal actors in this turbulent drama. Perhaps it was the turbulent\
        \ state of the country which led to a more frequent correspondence between\
        \ the government at home and the colonial officers. But, whatever be the cause,\
        \ the collection of manu script materials in reference to Peru is fuller and\
        \ more complete than that which relates to Mexico ; so that there is scarcely\
        \ a nook or corner so obscure, in the path of the adventurer, that some light\
        \ has not been thrown on it by the written correspondence of the period. The\
        \ historian has rather had occasion to complain of the embarras de richesses\
        \ ; for, in the multiplicity of contradictory testimony, it is not always\
        \ easy to detect the truth, as the multiplicity of cross lights is apt to\
        \ dazzle and bewilder the eye of the spectator. The present History has been\
        \ conducted on the same general plan with that of the Conquest of JVlexico.\
        \ In an introductory Book, I have endeavoured to pourtray the institutions\
        \ of the Incas, that tbe reader may be acquainted with the character and condition\
        \ of that extraordinary race, before he enters on the story of their subjugation.\
        \ The remaining books are occupied with the narrative of the Conquest. And\
        \ here the subject, it must be allowed, notwithstanding the oppor tunities\
        \ it presents for the display of character, strange romance incident, and\
        \ picturesque scenery, does not afford so obvious advan tages to the historian,\
        \ as the Conquest of Mexico. Indeed, few subjects can present a parallel with\
        \ that, for the purposes either of the historian or the poet. The natural\
        \ development of the story, there, is precisely what would be described by\
        \ the severest rules of art. The conquest of the country is the great end\

        \ within its light and elegant triple canopies, the chief chair for the Queen,\
        \ and smaller ones for her husband, and her eldest son, raised upon steps,\
        \ that are covered with a carpet of the purest scarlet velvet pile, spotted\
        \ with heraldic lions and roses. The massive ribs of the ceiling are like\
        \ so many bars of gold, between which the heraldic emblazonry streams forth,\
        \ richer yet more subdued. Twelve windows of the noblest dimensions, and filled\
        \ with stained glass, admit the light, and temper it to the magnificence within.\
        \ These windows represent the kings and queens of England, under canopies,\
        \ from William the Conqueror to Adelaide lately deceased. A gallery extends\
        \ along beneath the windows, of the most elaborate open brass work, itself\
        \ again farther enriched by compartments of coloured mosaic. It is useless\
        \ to speak of minor decorations, such as shields, and pendants, and small\
        \ terminal busts, and inscriptions, and candelabras, and devices, and carvings,\
        \ etc., in such a place as this. We cannot even pause over the unbroken sweep\
        \ of fretwork that extends all round the lower portion of the walls, behind\
        \ the rows of crimson benches, and which seems to outvie the most elaborate\
        \ stalls of our finest cathedral choirs. At each end of the house, (over the\
        \ throne at one extremity, and over the corresponding lofty canopy at the\
        \ other,) three arches of the most stately span enshrine as many frescoes\
        \ : and, it is sufficient to be able to say of them, that they are not unworthy\
        \ of their position. They comprise the Baptism of Ethelbert, by Dyce ; Edward\
        \ HI. con- ferring the Order of the Garter on the Black Prince, by Cope ;\
        \ Henry, Prince of Wales, committed to Prison for assaulting Judge Gascoigne,\
        \ also by Cope ; the Spirit of Religion, by Horsley ; and the Spirit of Chivalry,\
        \ by Maclise. Between all these windows, and frescoes, and in each of the\
        \ four corners, extends a range of niches for statues of colossal size, in\
        \ bronze gilt. These are to be devoted to the bold Barons, who obtained for\
        \ us the Great Charter. Beneath all this accumulation of art, and luxury,\
        \ and material decoration, the blue carpet, powdered with stars, has a charming\
        \ effect, and enhances all the rest. Of course the body of the house is occupied\
        \ by the seats for the Peers (of a deep crimson), the clerk's (oaken) table,\
        \ and the red woolsack of the Chancellor. Lord Camp- bell tells us the origin\
        \ of this remarkable piece of furniture. Having premised that there \" are\
        \ woolsacks for the Judge and other assessors, as well as for the Lord Chancellor,\"\
        \ he continues : \" They are said to have been introduced into the House of\
        \ Lords as a compliment to the staple manufacture of the realm ; but I believe\
        \ that, in the rude simplicity of early times, a sack of wool was frequently\
        \ used as a sofa \u2014 when the judges sat on a hard wooden bench, and the\
        \ advo cates stood behind a rough wooden rail, called the bar.\" What a very\
        \ different House of Lords must have existed then from that now before us!\
        \ There are, of course, galleries here also, for the reporters and for strangers.\
        \ The dimensions of the House arc, 97 feet long, by 45 feet wide, and 45 feet\
        \ high. And now let us step aside, foi a moment's quiet enjoyment of one of\
        \ the loveliest little promenades that one may ever hope to find in an architectural\
        \ interior \u2014 alas ! that Peers alone are privileged to take such a walk\
        \ \u2014 we refer to the Peers' Corridor, This is utterly unlike anything\
        \ else in the edifice, although of course the same kind of material must be\
        \ used for its construction and adornment. But there is an effect produced\
        \ by the elegant yet limited dimen sions \u2014 the blue star-spotted floor,\
        \ the wainscot-covered roof and wall of one side, and the range of delicate\
        \ windows that pierce the wall on the other, the stained glass of the most\
        \ ethereal tints, with here and there a sparkling bit of red, the deliciously\
        \ luxurious crimson benches within the recesses formed by the bold divisions\
        \ of the wainscot, \u2014 all, this we repeat, is so moulded together into\
        \ a. certain effect, that the words, How inexpressibly lovely ! seem to flow\
        \ from one's lips spontaneously the instant it is beheld. In the neighbourhood\
        \ of the House of Peers, are their Robing-room, Refreshment-rooms, Library,\
        \ and the apartments occupied by the Commissioners of Fine Arts, and by the\
        \ Commission (under the same Pre sidency, Prince Albert) for the Exhibition\
        \ of 1851 : that event without precedent in civilised history, for its character,\
        \ magnitude, and probable consequences, not only on the industry of all nations,\
        \ but on their mutual feelings toward each other. The Room of the Commissioners\
        \ of Fine Arts (who are entrusted with the regulation of the subjects for\
        \ all these frescoes and oil paintings, and statues, that will give England\
        \ a new National Gallery of the works of our own time, without professedly\
        \ appearing to do so,) contains, for the present, various pictures which obtained\
        \ prizes in the recent public competitions, and which, on account of their\
        \ excellence were purchased by the commis sioners for the New Palace. They\
        \ comprise a Sea view, by Knell ; the Burial of Harold, by Pickersgill ; Alfred\
        \ exciting the Britons to resist the landing of the Danes, by Watts ; and\
        \ C\u0153ur-de-Lion forgiving his Assassin, by Cross. The Refreshment-rooms\
        \ need not be described since they do not materially differ from those belonging\
        \ to the Commons, although much handsomer ; but there is an entrance-screen\
        \ connected with them, of striking beauty. The Lords' Library dates only from\
        \ the appointment of the present librarian, Mr. Leary, about some twenty-five\
        \ years ago, and yet already numbers 20,000 volumes. These consist mainly\
        \ of the parliamentary documents of both houses, which from the time of the\
        \ union of Ireland until now are complete. The collection of law books, for\
        \ the service of the judicial business of the House is also full and invaluable.\

        \ the business of the Society, the asso ciates having no voice in any of its\
        \ proceedings. The associates are chosen by the academicians from tbe great\
        \ body of artists who exhibit. The chief officers of the Academy are the president,\
        \ the keeper (who has the general care of the Institution), the treasurer,\
        \ librarian, and secretary. There are four professors, who lecture respectively\
        \ on painting, sculpture, archi tecture, and perspective, who are academicians\
        \ ; and a professor of anatomy, who is not always a member. The honorary members\
        \ are a professor of ancient litera ture, professor of ancient history, a\
        \ chaplain, of high rank in the Church (the Lord Bishop of London at present,)\
        \ and a secretary for foreign correspondence. These offices have been held\
        \ by Gibbon, Dr. Burney, Walter Scott, and other eminent men, in addition\
        \ to those before mentioned \u2014 Johnson and Goldsmith. All elections require\
        \ the sovereign's signature to make them valid. The most onerous, in every\
        \ sense, of the duties of the Academy is the choice of the works for the Annual\
        \ Exhibition. Large as the number of pictures admitted always is, a great\
        \ many are annually rejected ; and sometimes not from want of merit on the\
        \ part of the artist, but for want of space on the part of the Academy. The\
        \ process of selection, as it has been described to us, forms a noticeable\
        \ scene. Here sit the nine members of the Council behind a large table ; whilst\
        \ there porters, &c, are hurrying to and fro, passing every single work in\
        \ review before them. Is it suf ficiently good ? \u2014 it is so marked, and\
        \ placed in a certain part of the building. Is it only middling ? \u2014 it\
        \ goes, with a suitable mark, to another place, to take the chance of being\
        \ included in the Exhibition, if the good ones should leave any room. Is it\
        \ decidedly bad ? \u2014 it is at once ordered to be returned to the artist.\
        \ Where some seven or eight hundred artists are chosen, as in the late Exhibition,\
        \ we may judge of the character of a great part of the rejected. Fuseli used\
        \ to express, in his own satirical way, the anti-genial The Society of Arts,\
        \ &c. in the Adelphi. This once-flourishing and influential Society has been\
        \ so long reposing beneath the shadow of its laurels that now, when it arouses\
        \ itself to renewed vigour and action, it must not be surprised to find its\
        \ very exist ence, much more its services, forgotten, and that its greeting\
        \ with the public generally is often at first little else than a repetition\
        \ of the remark and question : \"The Society of Arts !\u2014 what Society\
        \ is that?\" There may be something mortifying in this, but it can not be\
        \ helped, that is one consolation ; another may be found in the respectable\
        \ antiquity of the custom of forgetting what is no longer of service to us.-\
        \ \" There's hope,\" says Hamlet, in a passage applying with still greater\
        \ force to societies than to individuals, \" a great man's memory may outlive\
        \ his life half-a-year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches then.\" Now,\
        \ if there had been any alternative but the building of churches, this Society\
        \ must have been remembered for at least its half-year of lifelessness or\
        \ inaction, so many, so various, and so important are the good things it has\
        \ done for the development and promotion of the arts, manufactures, and commerce\

        \ each entrance archway, seeming to intimate kings and queens only pass here.\
        \ For them too, and for them only, the architect seems to have flung his mighty\
        \ garland of enormous Tudor crowns and roses in stone all round these vast\
        \ pointed arches, between the clustered columns of which the arches are composed.\
        \ Six-sided buttresses or turrets rise at each angle of the tower, and accompany\
        \ it upwards. Over the arches, which are sixty feet high, we look first upon\
        \ a range of colossal niches for statues, side by side, eleven in number.\
        \ Those over the southern arch are to be devoted to the reigning Sovereign\
        \ and her nearest relatives, \u2014 including ber father, and George III.\
        \ and his queen. The statues over the western arch are not, we believe, yet\
        \ determined. Above this superb range commences thc first stage of the Tower,\
        \ con- sisting chiefly, on each of its sour sides, of a vast window in three\
        \ divisions, surrounded in the spandrils &c, by the varied regal arms, and\
        \ surmounted by a fresh band of sculpture preparatory to the commence ment\
        \ of a second stage : for there thc tower at present stops. To complete such\
        \ a view of the stupendous Before quitting the river front, we notice certain\
        \ semicircular brick projections, inclosing the lower parts of all the windows\
        \ of the basement story, and are surprised to find they are to keep out the\
        \ flood : a somewhat too vivid illustration of the worst feature of the site\
        \ of the New Houses \u2014 its lowness. During a recent winter the vaults\
        \ were all under water. In addition to these semicircular defences, a temporary\
        \ mound has been raised on the edge of the stone terrace, by the river. These\
        \ occasional irruptions of the Thames form a part of the gossip-history of\
        \ the Old Palace. Thus, about the time of the marriage of Henry III., the\
        \ river, as though tired of being so long a silent highway serving to merely\
        \ bring to and from the palace the parts of the magnificence collecting within,\
        \ found unwonted voice and motion ; and after preparatory thunder, and the\
        \ manifestation of a false sun beside the real one, rushed bodily into the\
        \ palace, exploring every part at its leisure, with the most provoking unconcern\
        \ at the inconveniences of such a visit. Boats had to be used in Westminster\
        \ Hall by those who could get them ; while others passed through it on horseback,\
        \ on their way to the interior of the palace. Again, in 1555, the river repeated\
        \ its visit, and again chose, of course, an interesting occasion \u2014 a\
        \ day of spectacle \u2014 the one on which the Lord Mayor of London had to\
        \ present the Sheriffs to the Barons of the Exchequer. But, we presume, when\
        \ they heard of such freaks as a wherry-man rowing over West minster-bridge*\
        \ instead of under it, and of his pro ceeding to pay a professional visit\
        \ to \" the Palace court,\" and going on in bis boat \" through the Staple\
        \ gate, and all the wool staple into the King-street,\" they thought it advisable\
        \ to decline the honour in tended them \u2014 and so stayed away. The last\
        \ of these incursions on the part of the river that we shall mention is the\
        \ flood of 1579, when it presented itself in the king's palace in a much more\
        \ vassal - like fashion ; namely, with an offering of its fish \u2014 many\
        \ of which were found on the floor of the ball after its departure. As with\

    - ['THE BRITISH MUSEUM. 79 THE PRINCIPAL FRONT. arranged in a hollow square, opposite
        the four points of the compass. The southern or Russell-street front is the
        principal one, and presents to view an imposing columnar facade, of the Ionic
        order. (E- graving.) Critics differ a good deal in opinion as to the archi
        tectural merits of this front ; but with such criticisms we have not here
        to do. In the centre is a portico formed of a double range of columns, eight
        in each range ; on either side of this is a smaller range of three columns
        ; and at the east and west angles are pro jecting wings, also surrounded by
        columns ; so that the columns of the whole front are upwards of forty in number.
        At the extreme west end is a detached build ing, and there will be another
        one at the east end, near the junction of Russell and Montague streets : these
        are to he dwelling-houses and offices for tho librarians and chief officers
        of the establishment. one should complain of this exclusion, we would beg
        him to consider, that looking merely at the backs of books is not very instructive
        ; while the noise occa sioned by an influx of visitors would inevitably disturb
        the librarians and students who are engaged there.'' The Museum visitor must,
        therefore, be content with know ing that this room is a very fine one, and
        supplied with a noble collection of books. The entire ground-floor of the
        north side (nearest to Montague-place) is closed from general visitors, being
        devoted to literature and study. There are two large reading-rooms, together
        about a hundred and twenty feet in length, and a library for books, extending
        two hundred feet. All the books presented by George IV. are deposited in the
        King''s library, just noticed ; but the much larger general library, derived
        from various sources, is depo sited in the rooms in this northern range. The
        fre quenters of the reading-rooms are students, draughts men, and literary
        persons, whose admission, upon the most liberal scale, is regulated only by
        letters of intro duction from two housekeepers, and who number, on an average,
        about two hundred in the course of a day ; they are furnished with tables,
        chairs, desks, pens, and ink, together with catalogues, and other facilities
        ior obtaining the books which they wish to read; but no books are allowed
        to be taken out of the building. Let us fancy we can have a bird''s-eye view
        of-the whole building, before we look at the interior. The central square
        court measures about three hundred and twenty feet by two hundred and forty.
        (Ergraving.) There are four stone fronts to the four sides of the building,
        looking into this court, all having more or less of an architectural character.
        The buildings at the centre of each side project more than those nearer the
        corners ; and on the western side the Phigalcian and Elgin Saloons project
        far beyond any rooms on the other three sides. At the north-west angle of
        the building, and in one or two other parts, are collections which are not
        thrown open to the public generally. Among these are the print-rooms, where
        a valuable collection of engravings is deposited. Other rooms are for the
        Banksian or botanical collection : an assemblage of books and spe cimens relating
        to botany. Coins, gems, and other. small but valuable objects, are also placed
        in rooms to which access can be obtained only by special introduc tion. The
        exclusion, in most if not in all cases, is determined on sufficient grounds
        ; either because the objects are really not very interesting to look at by
        general visitors, or because any injury or derange- There are two stories
        of galleries and rooms round the greater part of the building, to some of
        which the general public are not admitted. For instance, all the ground-floor
        between the portieo entrance and thc south-east angle, is occupied as a depository
        for manu scripts, and as apartments for receiving, sorting, and reading manuscripts.
        The ground-floor of the greater part of the east side is occupied by the King''s
        library, a magnificent apartment, three hundred feet long. The public used,
        a few years ago, to be admitted to this library, but the custom is now discontinued

        \ judg ment, would have thought a mere mis-shapen piece of stone. The committee\
        \ of 1805, for instance, made an especial point of noticing that the Townley\
        \ Marbles were in excellent condition, with the surface perfect ; and, where\
        \ injured, they were generally well restored, and perfectly adapted for the\
        \ decoration, and almost for the ornamental furniture, of a private house.\
        \ On reading this we may observe, with Mr. Williams,* from whom we have borrowed\
        \ the passage, \" Let no man after this discredit the royal saying, ' I always\
        \ buy Mr. 's paintings, they are so beautifully shiny, and look as smooth\
        \ as glass.' \" the Academy has had few greater men \u2014 few men more generally\
        \ great\u2014 than Fuseli. His lectures are ad mirable ; enforcing in pregnant\
        \ language the most pregnant truths. As with Reynolds, Michael Angelo was\
        \ the great god of his idolatry : and he used often to tell his friends how\
        \ he had been accustomed to lie on his back on the pavement of the Sistine\
        \ Chapel for hours together, day after day, and week after week, intently\
        \ wrapped in the grandeur of that matchless ceiling ; and it is not difficult\
        \ to trace in Fuseli's pro ductions something more than a spark of the sublime\
        \ genius of the Florentine. His paintings for the Shak spere Gallery, formed\
        \ under the patronage of the en lightened and generous Boydell, and the series\
        \ for the Milton Gallery, which was entirely his own production, testify a\
        \ mind of the very highest order, though not perhaps always under the best\
        \ regulation. Mr. Cun ningham says of him, very happily, \" Out of the seventy\
        \ exhibited paintings on which he reposed his hope of fame, not one can be\
        \ called common-place : they are all poetical in their nature, and as poetically\
        \ treated. Some twenty of these alarm, startle, and displease ; twenty more\
        \ may come within the limits of common comprehension ; the third twenty are\
        \ such as few men could produce ; while the remaining ten are equal in conception\
        \ to anything that genius has hitherto produced, and second only in their\
        \ execution to the true and recognised masterpieces of art.\"* England may\
        \ be proud of having fostered, and made, in every essential respect, her own,\
        \ such a man as Fuseli. Passing over a variety of works, all of greater or\
        \ less interest and importance, such as ' A Rustic Girl ' by Lawrence, ' The\
        \ Tribute Money ' by Copley, 'A Shepherd Boy' by Westall, 'Charity' by Stot\
        \ hard, ' Jael and Sisera' by Northcote, 'The Falling Giant' by Banks (a work\
        \ of wonderful power of expression), we pause a moment before the produc tions\
        \ of the greatest of British sculptors, the ' Apollo and Marpessa' and a cast\
        \ of the shield of Achilles, by Flaxman. \" If ever Purity visited the earth,\
        \ she resided with John Flaxman,\" said one who knew him intimately ; and\
        \ it is impossible to gaze on his works without feeling some such truth, breathed,\
        \ as it were, from out of the marble. Sir Joshua's judgment was for once found\
        \ tripping in Flaxman's case. As a student, he contended for the gold medal,\
        \ which, however, was given to Englehart \u2014 a man now only remembered\
        \ from that circumstance. Flaxman married early ; and one day, shortly after,\
        \ met Sir Joshua. \"So, Flaxman, I am told you are married : if so, sir, you\
        \ are ruined for an artist.\" Again was the president deceived : never was\
        \ marriage more happy in all its consequences. We wish we could pause over\
        \ some of the delightful domestic scenes recorded of this simple-hearted and\
        \ lofty-minded pair. Again we must hurry quickly by Baily's bust of Flaxman,\

        \ In the former the centre of the ceiling is divided into com partments, occupied\

        \ typical of the arts form the subjects, which were no doubt painted at the\
        \ time of the removal of the Academy from St. Martin's Lane to Somerset House,\
        \ when Sir Joshua and the chief academicians aided in the adorn ment of their\
        \ new abode. The books are in wainscot cases, closely covered in with crimson\
        \ silk, which gives the apartment a warm, rich aspect. The library now comprises\
        \ all the best works on art, a large number of prints, and a collection, of\
        \ considerable value, of engravings of the Italian school from the earliest\
        \ period, purchased from George Cumberland, who formed it. Busts ornament\

        \ that Wilson was saved perhaps from actual destitution, during some of the\
        \ later years of his life, by the office of librarian, which was given to\
        \ him by thc Academy. Let us now step from the library into the council room.\
        \ This is an apartment small in size for such a body as the Academy, but rich\
        \ in its works of art, chiefly consisting of the diploma pictures and statuary\
        \ : that is, the works given by the academicians on their admission, each\
        \ person being expected to present one work from his own hand. The ceiling\

        \ once the residence of the ancient family of Shaw, the superiors of the place,\
        \ is situated on an eminence overhanging the town. Part of the building is\
        \ old, but additions at different times have been made to it. It is now used\
        \ as chambers for con ducting the business of the superior and baron-baillie.\
        \ Greenoek contains three parishes ; the Old or West parish, originally taken\
        \ from the neighbouring parish of Inverkip, and the Middle and East parishes,\
        \ both taken from the West, and erected into parishes quoad sacra by the Court\
        \ of Teinds. Of the parish churches, two are not without considerable architectural\
        \ preten sions ; the Middle church, built in 1741, and the new West church,\
        \ which cost about 9000/. Besides the three parish churches and a Gaelic chapel\
        \ belonging to the establishment, there are 21 other places of worship, viz.\
        \ 1 Episcopalian, 6 Free Church, 4 United Presbyterian, 1 Reformed Presbyterian,\
        \ 1 Congregational, 1 Wesleyan, 3 Baptist, 1 Evangelical Union, 1 Roman Catholic,\
        \ 1 Catholic Apostolic, and a Seamens' chapel. The West parish used to be\
        \ considered the richest living in Scotland, and for a course of years it\
        \ yielded upwards of 700/. annually ; but since 1846, when, in con sequence\
        \ of the discovery of an old decree of valuation in the Teind -office, the\
        \ principal heritor was relieved of his liability for stipend to the extent\
        \ of thirteen chaldcrs, it has been reduced to about 550/. More than two-thirds\
        \ of this sum is derived from the glebe, which is feued, or let on building\
        \ leases, under a local act of parliament. There are (1850) 35 common schools\
        \ in Greenoek; two of them , the grammar school and the mathematical school,\
        \ under the management of the town council ; and one, the Highlanders' Academy,\
        \ under the management of an educational society. The others are either congrega\
        \ tional or adventure schools. There are also 2 charity schools and a ragged\
        \ school. The whole number of pupils at school in Greenoek is not supposed\
        \ to exceed one-tenth of the population. There are 3 libraries in the town\
        \ : the Cartsdyke mechanics* library, with about 2,100 vols. ; the library\
        \ of the mechanics' institution. with nearly 4,000 vols.; and the Greenoek\
        \ library, sounded in 1783, and the property os a body of shareholders. This\
        \ last contains about\" 10,000 vols. of miscellaneous literature, besides\
        \ a foreign library, and a scientific li brary (one of the best in the kingdom),\
        \ composed of the collection of Spence, the celebrated mathematician, who\
        \ bequeathed his books to his native town, and of more recent works purchased\
        \ with funds left for the purpose by James Watt. The Greenoek library occupies\
        \ the principal apartment in the Watt monument, a beautiful edifice dedicated\
        \ to the memory of the most distinguished native of Greenoek. Besides the\
        \ library, this building contains a marble statue of Watt by Chantrey, a museum,\
        \ a lecture room, librarian's house, &c. It has been com pleted at the joint\
        \ expense of the late Mr. Watt of Soho, son ofthe great engineer, and of a\
        \ body of subscribers chiefly belonging to Greenoek; the former contributing\
        \ 3.000/., the latter 1,400/. The marble statue cost 2,000/. additional, which\
        \ was raised chiefly in Greenoek. The first newspaper published in this town,\
        \ entitled the Greenoek Advertiser, was established in 1802. It still survives,\
        \ and appears twice a week. Though the inha- bitants are eminently distinguished\
        \ for education, intel- ligence, and commercial enterprise, literature, in\
        \ the strict sense ofthe term, is not much cherished by them, and the town\
        \ can boast of few great names besides those of Watt and Spence. In 1707,\
        \ when Wilson, the author of Clyde, a Poem, was appointed master in the grammar-\
        \ school of Greenoek, the magistrates stipulated that lie should renounce\
        \ what they called \" the profane and un- profitable art of poem-making I\"\
        \ The charitable and religious institutions of Greenoek are numerous and liberally\
        \ supported ; and a valuable addition is about to be made to them by an hospital\
        \ for decayed seamen, wliich is now being erected in the vicinity of the town\
        \ under tbe direction of the trustees of the late Sir Gabriel Wood, who bequeathed\
        \ 30,000/. towards its construction and endowment. Pauperism has greatly increased\
        \ within the last few years. In 1837 the total numher of permanent and casual\
        \ poor was 1.915; total expenditure 3,100/. Iu 1*49, the total number of paupers\
        \ was 3,400; viz. 1,163 on the per- manent roll, and 2,237 casual poor: expenditure,\
        \ 8,200/. ; showing an increase of paupers, in twelve years, of 1,485, and\
        \ of expenditure, 5,100/. Insane or fatuous poor (in eluded in the above amount)\
        \ 62. For many years the three burying-grounds ofGreenock were in a very unsatisfactory\
        \ state; but the evil has recently been remedied by the addition of a cemetery\
        \ ot great extent and beauty. It was completed in 18-16, and is under the\
        \ management ofthe town council. The ground, 20 acres, was procured from Sir\
        \ Michael Shaw Stewart at a feu-duty of 5rf. per fall, the lowest rate which\
        \ can be taken under the entail of the estate of Greenoek. Nearly 4,000/.\
        \ has been expended on its in- closure and decoration. An extraordinary work\
        \ has been constructed in the vicinity of Greenoek, by which not only the\
        \ town is abundantly supplied with water, but machinery toagreat extent may\
        \ be impelled. To accomplish this an artilicial lake, covering 294^ imp. acres,\
        \ has been excavated in the bosom of the neighbouring alpine district, behind\
        \ the town, by turning the courses of several streams and col- lecting the\
        \ rain into a basin prepared for their reception. From this, as from a common\
        \ source, an aqueduct or canal is conducted along the mountain range for several\
        \ miles, at an elevation of 520 ft. above the level of the Clyde ; and when\
        \ within less than a mile of the town, it pours down a torrent in successive\
        \ falls, the whole length of the aqueduct being 6Jm. In addition to the principal\
        \ basin, there is a compensation reservoir occupying 40 acres, besides several\
        \ of smaller dimensions, to secure a plentifu.1 supply of water in seasons\
        \ of the greatest drought. A series of self-acting sluices has been con- structed\
        \ in a most ingenious manner, by which all risk of overflow is obviated, at\
        \ the same time that every drop of rain, even during the greatest floods,\
        \ is preserved. This magnificent public work was planned hy the late Mr. Robert\
        \ Thorn, of Rothesay, and executed at the cost of ihe Shaw's Water Company.\
        \ It has more than real- ised the expectations of the projectors, though the\
        \ cost from first to last has not fallen short of 80,000/. There are two lines\
        \ of falls, each with a descent of 512 ft. The water sent down amounts to\
        \ 1,200 cubic ft. per minute, being equal lo 1,843 horse power. The charge\
        \ to the in- habitants for taking the water into their houses isOrf. per pound\
        \ on the rental. The docks of Greenoek deserve particular notice. Sir John\
        \ Shaw, the feudal superior of the town, having made two unsuccessful applications\
        \ (in 1G9G aud 1700) to the Scottish parliament for aid to build a harbour,\
        \ thc inhab. took the matter (1705) into their own hands, and agreed with\
        \ their superior to assess themselves at a certain rate, to build a proper\
        \ pier and harbour. Tbe work was finished in 1710, at an expense of 5,555/.,\
        \ Greenoek being, in the same year, made a custom- house port, and a branch\
        \ of the neighbouring and then more flourishing bor. of Port Glasgow. A new\
        \ dock was built in 1785 at a cost of 4000/. In 1824, two spacious wtt docks\
        \ were added, which cost 119,01.0/.; and at present (1850) a new tidal harbour\
        \ is in the course of being con- structed, with 14 ft. water at low ebb in\
        \ ordinary spring tides, which is expected to cost upwards of 120,000/., and\
        \ to surpass every similar harbour in the island. The debt on the three original\
        \ docks has been nearly ex- tinguished. In 1783 the harbour dues amounted\
        \ to only 114/. is. Bd.. whereas in 1841 they produced upwards of 16,000/.\
        \ The harbour is managed by trustees, induding the provo-t, magistrates, and\
        \ town council. The Clyde is navigable to Greenoek for vessels of any burden,\

        \ but are unfortunately lost. To the north, Alexander pushed beyond the Jaxartes,\
        \ but without being able to bring under subjection the rude tribes who tenanted\
        \ those regions. On the side of India, he learned the existence of the Ganges\
        \ and the fine coun tries on its banks, to which he eagerly sought to penetrate\
        \ ; but the mutiny of his troops compelled him to stop at the Hyphasis. The\
        \ Greeks had then an opportunity of observing some of the pecu liarities of\
        \ the Indian people ; their division into castes ; their fantastical religious\
        \ austerities ; aud the merit attached to suicide. Alexander de scended the\
        \ 1 ndus to its mouth, and sent thence a tleet under Nearchus,who traced the\
        \ coast of Asia as far as the Persian Gulph, which he ascended, and joined\
        \ his master at Babylon. This voyage, now so easy, was then considered a most\
        \ perilous achievement, and the party arrived in a state of distress and exhaustion.\
        \ Alexander himself, in returning through the maritime provinces, be came\
        \ aware of their extremely desolate charac ter, through which, indeed, his\
        \ army was in danger of perishing. On the partition of Alexander's empire,\
        \ Seleucus obtained Syria, with as much of the countries to the eastward as\
        \ his arms could hold in subjection. He is said to have attempted the conquest\
        \ of India; but there is no dis tinct account how far he penetrated; proba\
        \ bly it was not beyond Alexander's limit. He sent however an embassy, under\
        \ Megasthenes, to Palibothra (Pataliputra) on the Ganges, capital of one of\
        \ the most powerful kingdoms ever formed in India ; and through this channel\
        \ a good deal of additional information was obtained. He also employed his\
        \ admiral, Patroclus, in an at tempt to circumnavigate Asia ; and rumour even\
        \ represents him as having accomplished this vast circuit, and entered from\
        \ the northern ocean into the Caspian ; but the manifestly fabulous character\
        \ of this report makes it impossible to conjecture how far he really penetrated.\
        \ AU the materials thus collected were at the disposal of Eratosthenes, the\
        \ learned librarian of Alexandria ; and were employed by him in forming, on\
        \ the astronomical principles of Hip parchus, the first systematic delineation\
        \ of the globe. It is however, as to Asia, extremely im perfect. The Ganges\
        \ is made to fall into the eastern ocean, represented as bounding the habitable\
        \ earth. The Cape of the Coliaci (Comorin) is made at once the most southerly\
        \ and most easterly point of Asia. About ten degrees north of the Ganges,\
        \ and a very little east, is placed, in the same octan, the city of Thin\xE6\
        , often alluded to as the extremity oh that side of the habitable world :\
        \ this appears the first very imperfect rumour, which reached the western\
        \ nations of the Chinese empire. Not far from Thin\xE6, the coast turned westward,\
        \ stretching along the great northern ocean, which bounds both Eurcpe and\
        \ Asia, but at so low a latitude that the Caspian was considered to be a gulph\
        \ connected with it by a narrow strait. This was a retrograde step even from\
        \ Herodotus, who had described it justly as an inland sea. Asia, thus wanting\
        \ libet, China, the greater part of Tartary, and all Siberia, possessed little\
        \ above a third part of its real dimensions, -f The Romans did not, by their\
        \ conquests, obtain any accession to the knowledge of Asia. Before they reached\
        \ Persia, that country had been occupied by the Parthians, a bra\\e VI. Progress\
        \ of Discovert. \u2014 Thegeographi cal knowledge of Asia may be considered\
        \ as com mencing with its western countries, and with Greece, the cradle of\
        \ our present civilisation. Judea and Ph\u0153nicia are the quarters from\
        \ which the earliest information comes. The Jews scarcely recognised distinctly\
        \ any object more easterly than the Euphrates, emphati cally termed by them\
        \ \" the river ;*' beyond which, at a vague and uncertain distance, they placed\
        \ \" the ends of the earth.\" Tyre traded with several cities on its banks,\
        \ but does not seem to have pushed her intercourse further; though Dr. Vincent\
        \ reasonably conjectures, that the chests of rich apparel, carefully bound\
        \ with cords, brought by this channel, were from countries much more remote.\
        \ A great traffic is mentioned with Dedan, a city of Arabia, which, from its\
        \ many isles, and its merchandise of precious cloths, must have been in the\
        \ vicinity of Ormuz, and have drawn these commodities from India. They were\
        \ transported, by large caravans, across Arabia to Edom or Idumea, which was\
        \ greatly enriched by this traffic. From the south of Arabia, Sheba, or Sabea,\
        \ sent caravans laden with gold and incense, both probably obtained from the\
        \ opposite coasts of Africa. The knowledge of the Greeks, in the nearly cotemporary\
        \ age of Homer, was far more limited. He seems to have had no distinct knowledge\
        \ of any country east of Asia Minor. Colchos, on the Euxine, being supposed\
        \ to contain the chariot of the sun, must have been viewed as the eastern\
        \ extremity of the earth : the voyage thither by Jason, in the ship Argo,\
        \ was regarded as an almost superhuman achievement. The name Asia was then\
        \ applied only to a part of the coast of Caria, whence it was extended to\
        \ the peninsula, and ultimately to the whole continent ; after which the other\
        \ was named the Lesser Asia.* The triumphant contest of Greece with Per sia\
        \ excited deep interest, and generated plans of conquest, which rendered every\
        \ information respecting that empire acceptable. The most valuable contributor\
        \ was Herodotus, who, during a residence at Babylon, collected materials for\
        \ a description of the satrapies into which it was di vided. To the north\
        \ it extended over a part of the Caucasian provinces, enabling the writer\
        \ to delineate tolerably the extent and boundaries of the Caspian. Margiana\
        \ and Bactria probably reached to the Oxus, beyond which wandered the Scythian\
        \ tribe named Massaget\xE6. India was the most easterly satrapy ; but being\
        \ described as containing no great river except the Indus, and bounded by\
        \ an immense desert, it evidently contained only the western provinces, while\
        \ the Gangetic and southern countries were entirely unknown. Herodotus gives\
        \ a somewhat rude description of the inhabitants, suggested probably by the\
        \ bordering mountaineer tribes. The fact of its affording a revenue four times\
        \ that of Egypt, shows clearly that it was already opulent and improved. Darius\
        \ is said to have employed Scylax, the Caryandrian, to descend thelndus, sail\
        \ along the southern coast, and come up the Red Sea ; a voyage accomplished\
        \ in two years, t The next great source of information to the Greeks was the\
        \ expedition of Alexander. It did not, indeed, extend much beyond the al ready\
        \ known limits of the Persian empire ; but the countries, before known only\
        \ by vague report, were then carefully examined and described. Under his direction\

        rows are said to be making the same material for the palace of Tatcheres.
        We reasonably infer from hence that the palace begun by Usercheres was completed
        by his successor, Tatcheres.* That Ra-eses was a courtier of this king''s
        there cannot be a doubt. He was librarian to Tatcheres, and had the charge
        of his great cattle. Against evidence like this, the mere collocation of names
        in a list in such confusion as we have found in Manetho''s 5th dynasty, cannot
        be allowed any weight whatever. We, therefore, at once assume that Tatcheres
        was co -regent with, and successor of, Usercheres. From other monuments we
        shall be able to collect other indications which will clearly demon strate
        that we are making no mistake in doing so. The monumental remains of the reign
        of Tatcheres are by no means so numerous as those of his pre decessor. Like
        the kings of the former dynasty he has inscribed his name on the rocks of
        the Wady Meghara (see Plate, No. 1). It was mainly for the sake of the quarries
        and mines in the vicinity that this utter desert seems to have been valued
        in these remote times. The name of Tatcheres was also copied by Rosel lini
        from a tomb at Sakkarah in 1828.f It was ap parently in connection with that

        \ and the Tigris ; he then marched back to Egypt, laden with the spoils he\
        \ had acquired by his conquests. This prince carried off a prodigious quantity\
        \ of gold and silver, and two thousand five hundred statues, part of which\
        \ were those Egyptian idols that Cambyses had carried into Persia. When Ptolemy\
        \ Euergetes set out on this expedition, his queen Berenice made a vow to consecrate\
        \ her hair, if he should return in safety. Accord ingly she caused it to be\
        \ cut off, and dedicated it to the gods. This consecrated hair is fabled to\
        \ have disappeared, and to have been con verted into a constellation in the\
        \ stars. (B. C. 274.) Ptolemy, in his return from his expedition, passed through\

        \ Israel, in order to render homage to him for the victories he had obtained\
        \ over the king of Syria. He devoted the leisure of peace to the cultivation\

        of the ancient newaubs, the factories and churches of the Dutch, French, and
        Portuguese nations, are all sunk into ruin, and overgrown with jungle." Though
        thus comparatively desolate, its minarets, huge ruined palaces, and other
        monu ments of departed grandeur, give it an impressive and not unpleasing
        aspect, during the periodical rains of closing summer and autumn, when it
        stands alone above a wide, watery waste. At present, the works and places
        of public character are fitting only to be enumerated, not described. The
        city and suburbs are, in a recent publication,5 stated to possess ten bridges,
        thirteen ghats or landing-places, seven ferry-stations, twelve bazars, three
        public wells, a variety of buildings for fiscal and judicial purposes, a jail
        and jail hospital, a lunatic asylum, and a native hospital. Among the noticeable
        establishments is the elephant depot,6 containing generally from two to three
        hundred of these animals. The religious edifices devoted to Christianity are
        St. Thomas''s Church, the Baptist Mission meeting-house, the Eomish, Armenian,
        and Greek churches. There are said to be a hundred and eighty Mussulman mosques,
        and a hundred and nineteen Brahminical temples. The English, Armenians, and
        Greeks, have cemeteries at this place. Here is a college subject to the control
        of the Council of Education, but under the management of a local committee,7
        consisting of twelve members, of whom one half are unconnected with government,
        and five are natives. The committee have a secretary, and for conducting the
        educational duties, there are, besides a head master, superintending the whole
        establishment, three masters in the senior, and nine in the junior school
        department, of which latter six are natives. There is also a vernacular de
        partment, directed by two pundits ; and attached are a librarian and a writer.
        In September, 1850, there were 340 pupils ; of whom 46 were Christians, 15

        verify the accuracy of this catalogue, by having another taken by a different

        and Rome. It is true that the catalogue quoted by Toderini must have been
        very incomplete, for it only gives the titles of 1,150 works, while D''Ohsson

        about 1,200. This library, as Avell as others attached to mosques, is principally
        frequented by stu dents of the annexed colleges and schools. The library of
        Muhammad II is numerously attended, as there are eighteen distinct colleges
        belonging to his mosque. The Library of St Sophia, founded by Suleiman the
        Great, at the period of the promulgation of his Kanoun, and increased in 1754
        by Mahmud I, has the inscription " There is no merit in me save from God "
        painted above the doorway. The same sentence is repeated in all the books
        and MSS, forming part of the library. It has eight librarians, and contains
        1,527 works, among them a MS. Koran, written, or said to be written, by Osman,
        the third Chalife. This library fell into complete ruin through the neglect
        of successive administrations, and many of the most valuable works having
        been destroyed, the building was pulled down by Mahmud I, and then rebuilt
        and replenished Avithin the mosque in 1744. It is es teemed the most important

        rest on their sides. The titles are written upon thc binding. Almost all works
        have a second cover, like a map case, as an additional pro tection against
        damp and insects. The greater part are transcribed upon vellum, or highly-glazed
        paper. The book-cases of some libraries, that, for instance, of Raghib Pacha,
        are in the centre of the apartment, ancl form a square protected by iron doors.
        The whole is surrounded and covered by an external Avirc fence, admitting
        ample space Avithin for the librarian. The floors are matted, and upon one
        or more sides are low divans or cushions, upon which students seat themselves
        to read ; whilst a narrow form in front serves as a table or rest for the
        volumes they may require. Such persons as are engaged in transcrib ing Works

        \ prosperous, and impregnable.90 The emperor Theophilus, son of Michael the\
        \ Stammerer, was one of the most active and high-spirited princes who reigned\
        \ at The Amorian Constantinople during the middle age. In offensive or SeopuTiB1\"\
        \ defensive war he marched in person five times against the \"\"^Motas\" Saracens,\
        \ formidable in his attack, esteemed by the enemy AD-838 in his losses and\
        \ defeats. In the last of these expeditions he pene trated into Syria, and\
        \ besieged the obscure town of Sozopetra ; * the casual birthplace of the\
        \ caliph Motassem, whose father Harun was attended in peace or war by the\
        \ most favoured of his wives and concubines. The revolt of a Persian impostor\
        \ employed at that moment the arms of the Saracen, and he could only intercede\
        \ in favour of a place for which he felt and acknowledged some degree of filial\
        \ affection. These solicitations determined the emperor to wound his pride\
        \ in so sensible a part. Sozopetra was levelled with the ground, the Syrian\
        \ prisoners were marked or mutilated with igno minious cruelty, and a thousand\
        \ female captives were forced away from the adjacent territory. Among these\
        \ a matron of the house of Abbas invoked, in an agony of despair, the name\
        \ of Motassem ; and the insults of the Greeks engaged the honour of her kinsman\
        \ to avenge his indignity, and to answer her appeal. Under the reign of the\
        \ two elder brothers, the inheritance of the youngest had been confined to\
        \ Anatolia, Armenia, Georgia, and Circassia ; this frontier station had exercised\
        \ his military talents ; and among his accidental claims to the name of Octonary,sl\
        \ the most meritorious are the eight battles which he gained or fought against\
        \ the enemies of the Koran. In this personal quarrel, the troops of Irak,\
        \ Syria, and Egypt were recruited from the tribes of Arabia and the Turkish\
        \ hordes : his cavalry might be numerous, though we should deduct some myriads\
        \ from the hundred and thirty thousand horses of the royal stables ; and the\
        \ expense of the armament was computed at four millions 90 The Arabs and the\
        \ Greeks are alike silent concerning the invasion of Rome by the Africans.\

        \ to the following circumstance in the life of Motassem: he was the eighth\

        \ was excited by resentment and emulation ; and their companions, in the eye\
        \ of history, are the true Peers and Paladins of French chivalry. After a\
        \ bloody field, in which Abderame was slain, the Saracens, in the close of\
        \ the evening, retired to their camp. In the disorder and despair of the night\
        \ the various tribes of Yemen and Damascus, of Africa and Spain, were provoked\
        \ . to turn their arms against each other : the remains of their host were\
        \ suddenly dissolved, and each emir consulted his safety by an hasty and separate\
        \ retreat. At the dawn of day the stillness of an hostile camp was suspected\
        \ by the victorious Christians : on the report of their spies they ventured\
        \ to explore the riches of the vacant tents ; but if we except some cele brated\
        \ relics, a small portion of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful\
        \ owners. The joyful tidings were soon diffused over the Catholic world, and\
        \ the monks of Italy could affirm and believe that three hundred and fifty,\
        \ or three hundred and seventy-five, thousand of the Mahometans had been crushed\
        \ by the hammer of Charles,32 while no more than fifteen hundred Christians\
        \ were slain in the field of Tours. But this incredible tale is sufficiently\
        \ disproved by the caution of the French general, who apprehended the snares\
        \ and acci dents of a pursuit, and dismissed his German allies to their native\
        \ forests. The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength and\
        \ blood, and the most cruel execution is inflicted, not in the ranks of battle,\
        \ but on the backs of a flying enemy. Yet the victory of the Franks was complete\
        \ and final ; Aquitain was recovered by r l , . Tbey retreat the arms of Eudes\
        \ ; the Arabs never resumed the conquest before the of Gaul,a and they were\
        \ soon driven beyond the Pyrenees by Charles Martel and his valiant race.33\
        \ It might have been expected 32 These numbers are stated by Paul Warnefrid,\
        \ the deacon of Aquileia (de Gestis Langobard. 1. vi. [c. 46] p. 921, edit.\
        \ Grot.), and Anastasius, the librarian of the Roman church (in Vit. Gregorii\
        \ II. [ap. Muratori Scrip. R. I. vol. iii. p. 155]), who tells a miraculous\
        \ story of three consecrated sponges, which rendered invulnerable the French\
        \ soldiers among whom they had been shared. It should seem that, in his let\
        \ ters to the pope, Eudes usurped the honour of the victory, for which he\
        \ is chastised by the French annalists, who, with equal falsehood, accuse\
        \ him of inviting the Saracens. 33 Narbonne and the rest of Septimania was\
        \ recovered by Pepin, the son of Charles Martel, a.d. 755 (Pagi, Critica,\

        \ sudden inroad of the Arabs, who employed the captives in the construc tion\
        \ of the mosch of Cordova (De Guignes, Hist, des Huns, torn. i. p. 354). \xB0\
        \ This is not strictly correct. A few years after their defeat at Tours, the\
        \ Saracens again extended their possessions in France, garrisoned Valence\
        \ and Lyon, and ravaged a part of Burgundy and Dauphine'. Charles Martel was\
        \ obliged to undertake two campaigns against them in order to drive them back\

        \ circumscribe the truth of facts by the rule of equity, Scripture, and tradition,\
        \ and appeal to the evidence of the Latins,31 and the lives32 and epistles\

        \ to the emperor Leo, are still extant ; 33 and if they cannot be praised\

        \ the emperor, portrait, or at least the mask, of the founder of the papal\
        \ monarchy. \" During ten pure and fortunate years,\" says Gregory to the\
        \ emperor, \" we have tasted the annual comfort of your \" royal letters,\

        \ \" your confusion ; and were you to enter a grammar-school, and \" avow\
        \ yourself the enemy of our worship, the simple and pious \" children would\
        \ be provoked to cast their horn-books at your head.\" After this decent salutation\
        \ the pope attempts the usual distinction between the idols of antiquity and\
        \ the Christian images. The former were the fanciful representations of phantoms\
        \ or d\xE6mons, at a time when the true God had not manifested his person\

        \ In the field of controversy I always pity the moderate party, who stand\
        \ on the open middle ground exposed to the fire of both sides. 31 They appeal\

        \ the Liber Pontificalis was composed and continued by the apostolical librarians\
        \ and notaries of the viiith and ixth centuries, and that the last and smallest\
        \ part is the work of Anastasius, whose name it bears. The style is barbarous,\
        \ the narrative partial, the details are trifling; yet it must be read as\
        \ a curious and authentic record of the times. The epistles of the popes are\
        \ dispersed in the volumes of Councils. 33 The two epistles of Gregory II.\

        \ physiognomy of the archi tect (which looks as if Hogarth might have moulded\
        \ it), stands at the top of the staircase. The interior of the library is\
        \ light and graceful, though perhaps not very appropriate. A gallery, supported\
        \ by Ionic pilasters, is carried round the room. The dome, which is forty-six\
        \ feet in height from the floor, is divided into compartments, and, like the\
        \ walls, elaborately orna mented in stucco. The contents of the room deserve\
        \ a leisurely examination. Among the works of art are casts of some of the\
        \ most celebrated antique statues, which are so arranged as very considerably\
        \ to heighten the general effect of the room ; but of more value to thc visitor\
        \ are the few original antiquities, such as the marble candelabra found in\
        \ the ruins of the Emperor Adrian's yilla. There are also some busts of eminent\
        \ naturalists, the first place among which is due, perhaps, to that of Cuvier,\
        \ by the younger David. Among the more generally interesting of the objects\
        \ connected with the particular purpose of the library, are the large and\
        \ choice collections of Italian and other marbles, which display a variety\
        \ that not a little surprises a novice ; and some excellent models, illustrative\
        \ of geology and physical geography. From the interior you pass to the balustrade\
        \ which surrounds the dome on the exterior, from whence you may obtain an\
        \ ex cellent view of the city. It was for this, as much as for the library\
        \ itself, that we counselled the stranger not to omit visiting the Radcliffe.\
        \ The building stands nearly in the centre of the city, and from it you have\
        \ a panoramic view of Oxford, such as should not be missed. The marvellous\
        \ assemblage of academic architecture can here be fairly understood ; the\
        \ extent and variety are perceived, and their positions and con nection become\
        \ clear; while the height, although quite sufficient to let the whole of the\
        \ city, and a good por tion of the suburbs, be seen, is yet not so great as\
        \ to produce that very unsatisfactory appearance common in what are called\
        \ bird's-eye views. In the centre of the square of which the Schools form\
        \ one side, stands thc Radcliffe Library, a building which presents a curious\
        \ contrast to the surrounding edifices. The building itself is supported upon\
        \ arches and surmounted by a dome. The basement consists of a double octagon\
        \ ; the upper part is round, and has attached Corinthian columns. Not much\
        \ can be said either for its grandeur or beauty when seen close at hand, but\
        \ the lofty dome is a striking object from a distance, and adds a pleasing\
        \ variety to the general view of the \" city of spires and pinnacles.\" Gibbs\
        \ was the architect; and the building occupied from 1737 to 1749. Whatever\
        \ others may think of the pile, the architect himself was very well satisfied\
        \ with his work ; of which he published an elaborate series of elevations\
        \ and working plates, under the title of 'Bibliotheca Radclivinia,' fob, 1747.\
        \ Tfcc building was founded by the eccentric but eminent physician, The buildings\
        \ we have been noticing are placed close together: the other University buildings\

        \ the limits. Neither of these shall we visit. The former has nothing in its\
        \ exterior to attract the stranger, who is, of course, not admitted inside.\
        \ The University Printing-office is a very large building, having a frontage\
        \ of 250 feet, and projecting wings 288 feet long ; and it has some architectural\

        \ the same source ; viz., the Celtic, which may be styled the uMversal language\
        \ of the post-dUuvian world, and a sister dialect of the Hebrew : \u2014 But\
        \ the foregomg anecdote has been strongly con tested, by a writer in one of\
        \ the magazMes,1 who deMes the fact ; asserting, that there is no affiMty\
        \ between the Irish and Biscayan languages, and appealing to aU who have any\
        \ trade or Mtercourse with Biscay. Our Enquirer goes on to give an account\
        \ of the war of the Titans, and of the Cabiric 2 mysteries, which were by\

        \ sovereigns over a vast empire, compre hendMg aU Europe and great part of\
        \ Asia ; that this empire existed long before those petty Mngdoms of Greece,\
        \ that boasted such great anti quity ; that the Titans were masters of aU\
        \ the knowledge derived from the i \"Gentleman's Magazine\" for October, 1758,\

        \ Johnson was much pleased. At this place, Mr. Wise had fitted up a house\
        \ and gardens in a singular manner, but with great taste. Here was an excellent\
        \ library, particularly a valuable collection of books in Northern literature,\
        \ with which Johnson was often very busy. One day Mr. Wise read to us a dissertation\
        \ which he was preparing for the press, entitled 'A History and Chronology\

        \ ruin of that kingdom, which Final con- was accomplished under the reign\
        \ of Sigismond, the son of Bur^jody Gundobald. The catholic Sigismond has\

        \ the royal a.d. 532. sajnt were stained with the blood of his innocent son,\
        \ whom he inhumanly sacrificed to the pride and resentment of a stepmother.\
        \ He soon discovered his error, and bewailed the irreparable loss. While Sigismond\
        \ embraced the corpse of the unfortunate youth, he received a severe admonition\
        \ from one of his attendants : \" It is not \" his situation, O king ! it\
        \ is thine which deserves pity and lamenta- \" tion.\" The reproaches of a\
        \ guilty conscience were alleviated, however, by his liberal donations to\
        \ the monastery of Agaunum, or St. Maurice, in Vallais ; which he himself\
        \ had founded in honour of the imaginary martyrs of the Theb\xE6an legion.44\
        \ A full chorus of perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious king ; he\
        \ assiduously practised the austere devotion of the monks ; and it was his\
        \ humble prayer that Heaven would inflict in this world the punishment of\
        \ his sins. His prayer was heard : the avengers were at hand ; and the provinces\
        \ of Burgundy were overwhelmed by an army of victorious Franks. After the\
        \ event of an unsuccessful battle, Sigismond, who wished to protract his life\
        \ that he might prolong his penance, con- cealed himself in the desert in\
        \ a religious habit till he was discovered and betrayed by his subjects, who\
        \ solicited the favour of their new masters. The captive monarch, with his\
        \ wife and two children, was transported to Orleans, and buried alive in a\
        \ deep well by the stern command of the sons of Clovis, whose cruelty might\
        \ derive some excuse from the maxims and examples of their barbarous age.\
        \ Their ambition, which urged them to achieve the conquest of Burgundy, was\
        \ inflamed or disguised by filial piety : and Clotilda, whose sanctity did\

        \ land. By this means a fine library, amounting to upwards of 150,000 volumes,\
        \ has been accumulated. There are also among the MSS. many valuable works\
        \ on the civil and ecclesiastical history of Scotland. This library belongs\
        \ wholly to the Faculty of Advo- cates, and its current expenses are defrayed\
        \ by small fees from the advocates ; but nothing can exceed the liberality\
        \ with which it is managed. Inhabitants of the city, who are in any way known\
        \ as trustworthy, may have books home for perusal at pleasure ; while strangers\
        \ have no difficulty whatever in obtaining access to its treasures. The catalogues,\
        \ instead of being arranged in one alphabetical series of authors' names,\
        \ (as in the ill-digested system at the British Museum Library,) are first\
        \ grouped into a few large divisions, according to the subjects, and then\
        \ treated alphabetically under those divisions. A MS. Bible of the eleventh\
        \ century ; a copy of Faust and Guttemberg's first printed Bible ; the original\
        \ solemn League and Covenant, signed in 1580; and a number of other literary\
        \ treasures, are among the contents of the library. All these books and MSS.\
        \ have been deposited in galleries and rooms prepared from time to time for\
        \ their reception, as occasion required ; but they are worthy of a finer and\
        \ more complete building, We now come back again into the High-street, where\
        \ the venerable old Church of St. Giles forms the northern boundary of the\
        \ Parliament-square, having an opening between it and the Police-office on\
        \ the one side, and another between it and the County Hall on the other. The\
        \ church is thus isolated. It is one of the most ancient buildings in Edinburgh,\
        \ though its exterior has been frequently renovated. At what period the actual\
        \ foundation was made seems to be unknown ; but the church is mentioned in\
        \ the year 1359, in a charter of David II. About a century afterwards, it\
        \ was made a collegiate church, and as many as forty altars were supported\
        \ within its walls. As the Scotch have, within the last three centuries, shown\
        \ but little liking for episcopal and cathedral establishments, this old church\
        \ has suffered some curious mutations in respect to the arrangement of its\
        \ interior. After the Reformation, many of the sacred vessels and relics were\
        \ removed, and the building itself was partitioned off into sour places of\
        \ worship. In 1603 James the Sixth took a farewell of his subjects in this\
        \ church, before proceeding to take possession of the throne of England. In\
        \ 1643 the solemn League and Covenant was sworn to within its walls, by the\
        \ various parties to that agreement. At the present time the old Cathe- dral\
        \ is divided into three distinct churches \u2014 the High Church, the West\
        \ Church, and the Tolbooth Church. If we imagine the nave, the choir, and\

        \ of convenient breadth on both sides. The town is rapidly stretching towards\

        \ taken from the neighbouring parish of Inverkip, and the Middle and East\
        \ parishes, both taken from the West, and erected into parishes quoad sacra\
        \ by the Court of Teinds. Of the parish churches, two are not without considerable\
        \ architectural preten sions ; the Middle church, built in 1741, and the new\
        \ West church, which cost about 9000/. Besides the three parish churches and\
        \ a Gaelic chapel belonging to the establishment, there are 21 other places\
        \ of worship, viz. 1 Episcopalian, 6 Free Church, 4 United Presbyterian, 1\
        \ Reformed Presbyterian, 1 Congregational, 1 Wesleyan, 3 Baptist, 1 Evangelical\
        \ Union, 1 Roman Catholic, 1 Catholic Apostoiic, and a Seamens' chapel. The\
        \ West parish used to be considered the richest living in Scotland, and for\

        \ 4,000 vols.; and the Greenock library, founded in 1783, and the property\

        \ recent works purchased with funds left for the purpose by James Watt. The\
        \ Greenock library occupies the principal apartment in the Watt monument,\

        \ those of Watt and Spence. In 1767, when Wilson, the author of Clyde, a Poem,\
        \ was appointed master in the grammar school of Greenock, the magistrates\
        \ stipulated that he should renounce what they called \" the profane and un\
        \ profitable art of poem-making 1\" The charitable and religious institutions\
        \ of Greenock are numerous and liberally supported ; and a valuable addition\
        \ is about to be made to them by an hospital for decayed seamen, which is\
        \ now being erected in the vicinity of the town under the direction of the\
        \ trustees of tbe late Sir Gabriel Wood, who bequeathed 30,1 0(7. towards\
        \ its construction and endowment. Pauperism has greatly increased within the\
        \ last few years. In 1837 the total number of permanent and casual poor was\

        \ unsatisfactory state; but the evil has recently been remedied by tbe addition\
        \ of a cemetery ot great extent and beauty. It was completed in 1846, and\
        \ is under the management of the town council. The ground, 20 acres, was procured\
        \ from Sir Michael Shaw Stewart at a feu-duty of hd. per fall, the lowest\
        \ rater, which can be taken under the entail of the estate of Greenock. Nearly\
        \ 4,000/. has been expended on its in closure and decoration. An extraordinary\
        \ work has been constructed in the vicinity of Greenock, by which not only\
        \ the town is abundantly supplied with water, but machinery to a great extent\
        \ may be impelled. To accomplish this an artificial lake, covering imp. acres,\
        \ has been excavated in the bosom of the neighbouring alpine district, behind\
        \ the town, by turning the courses of several streams and col lecting the\
        \ rain into a basin prepared tor their reception. From this, as from a common\
        \ source, an aqueduct or canal is conducted along the mountain range for several\
        \ miles, at an elevation of 520 ft. above the level of tho Clyde ; and when\
        \ within less than a mile of the town, it pours down a torrent in successive\
        \ falls, the whole length of the aqueduct being 6-J m. Io addition to the\
        \ principal basin, there is a compensation reservoir occupying 40 acres, besides\
        \ several of smaller dimensions, to secure a plentiful supply of water in\
        \ seasons of the greatest drought. A series of self-acting sluices has been\
        \ con structed in a most ingenious manner, by which all risk of overflow is\
        \ obviated, at the same time that every drop of rain, even during the greatest\
        \ floods, is preserved. This magnificent public work was plannrd by the late\
        \ Mr. Robert Thorn, of Rothesay, and executed at the cost of the Shaw's Water\

        \ On the occasion of the first visit of Queen Victoria to Brighton, October\
        \ 4th, 1837, a similar banquet was given to the children upon the Steine.\
        \ The most celebrated public buildings of the Steine were the libraries, which\
        \ were the principal resort of the visitors. The first library here was instituted\

        \ by Mr. Shaw, confectioner, and others, contiguous to the York Hotel, where\
        \ also was the Post Office. Mr. Woodgate was succeeded by Miss Widget, who\
        \ resigned it to Mr. Bowen ; after whom came Mr. Crawford, and, lastly, Mr.\
        \ F. G. Fisher. The other library was that of Mr. Thomas, after whom was Mr.\
        \ Dudlow, who was succeeded by Mr. James Gregory, whose successor, Mr. Donaldson,\
        \ resigned the establishment to Mr. Thomas Lucombe. Mr. Donaldson pulled down\
        \ the original low building in j. G06, and erected the present structure,\
        \ which has however, since the carriage road has been formed in front of it,\
        \ been much modernized to suit the various businesses to which the premises\
        \ have been devoted. \"A Diarist,\" writing August 23rd, 1779, says, \"There\
        \ is a sort of rivalry between the two Librarians on the Steyne, as to their\

        chance, when he asked her in what name she would have it, and she said Mrs.
        Goodlove ; that a lady at length shuffled and cut the cards ; that Mr. Walker
        dealt them ; that the first dealt was called Mr. Bangup ; that she won Pam,
        and got the prize ; that Mr. Walker told her she had won it, and that she
        was to receive seven shillings in goods, or subscribe an extra sixpence, and
        have two chances for another box of much superior value ; that she took the
        prize she had won, and lost two shillings in other ventures, &c." When questioned
        by the Earl of Chichester, one of the magistrates, as to the real value of
        the prize that had been nominated at 7s, her husband whispered to her what
        to say ; which being overheard by the Noble Earl, Mr. White was compelled
        instantly to quit the room, and to wait without, that he nright be at hand
        in case he should be wanted. Mr. Adolphus (the witness being dismissed) addressed
        the Bench in a most able speech, concluding by producing an Act of Parliament
        passed in 1806, by which he clearly evinced that the present informations
        could not be sustained, as the said Act dispossessed magistrates of all jurisdiction
        and control in matters of that sort then before them. Mr. Courthorpe laboured
        hard, notwithstanding, to gain his point ; but as his oratory had not the
        power to super sede an Act of Parliament, his labour was in vain. As authorities
        in support of the Act he produced, Mr. Adolphus was upheld by the opinion
        of the Attorney-General, and a decision in the Court of King''s Bench. The
        Magistrates, from what had been brought forward by Mr. Adolphus, saw their
        incompetency in so strong a light, that they dismissed the business, even
        without hearing the reply which Mr. Adolphus was about to make to his learned
        friend. There were three other informations, all of which of course were withdrawn.
        The librarians returned home in high spirits, and the Loo parties, subsequently,
        and exulting in the success of the day, were more numerous than usual. Pam,
        the good genius of Loo, continued to hold sway at the libraries till 1817,
        when the magistrates took an antipathy towards him, owing to the unbounded
        patronage which he received from the ladies in general. They considered him

        materials. In carrying out his researches, the author has been placed under
        many obligations to scientific friends. To Dr. Henry, the learned Secretary

        Folsom of the Historical Society of New York : he is specially indebted for
        the liberality with which Museums and Libraries have been placed at his command.

        \ were promulgated ; and a proper acquaintance with its details will prepare\
        \ the way for the study of Modern History (to which the third volume is devoted),\
        \ which will be but imperfectly understood without a knowledge of the two\
        \ preceding divisions. One advantage arising from a comprehensive plan of\
        \ this kind, is that no one nation's history assumes an undue preponderance\
        \ over another. The pupil cannot be misled into the notion that there are\
        \ but three or four nations worth troubling his head about, since, if he pay\
        \ proper attention to the cotemporaneous history, he will find how much the\
        \ actions of one country have influenced those of others, and that impulses\
        \ which actuate man at the pres ent day may have been derived from remote\
        \ antiquity, or from the most distant nations. As in a family, so among the\
        \ different peoples of the earth, the turbulent conduct of one member im pairs\
        \ the harmony of the others, \u2014 a truth which, in these days of steam\
        \ and electricity, is sensitively recognized in every Ex change almost every\
        \ hour. Another advantage, or, rather, pe culiars of the present plan, is\
        \ that the history of each country is extracted from its own annals, and complete\
        \ in itself: it is, therefore, independent of any other; hence, there is very\
        \ fre quently the repetition of au event; for instance, two accounts of the\
        \ battle of Marathon will be found, one in the history of Greece, the other\
        \ in that of Persia, but in each case it is consid ered from the national\
        \ point of view. feelings of others might be wounded. This ought rather to\
        \ en hance than to detract from the value of his narrative. With regard to\
        \ the mode in which the work ought to be used, a glance at the arrangement\
        \ of it will probably suggest the readiest way to the teacher, \u2014 or to\
        \ the student, where there is no teacher. In Ancient History there are a few\
        \ leading nations to whom the others were in turn subordinate ; as, for instance,\
        \ first Egypt, then Assyria, then Syria, then Greece, and then Rome. The Author\
        \ suggests that it would be well to study the histories of these leading countries\
        \ thoroughly, reading each of the cotemporaneous ones in a less particular\
        \ manner, yet so that the pupil shall be exercised as to the details thereof\
        \ century by century. But as the principal object of the work is to present\
        \ a general view of the affairs of the world during each century, and, in\
        \ so doing, to treat the subject in its entirety, and not with special reference\
        \ to any one leading nation, care must be takeu to impress upon the pupil's\
        \ mind that, in selecting Egypt, Greece, or Italy, or any other country, as\
        \ the connect ing link, he must not lose sight of the independence of each\
        \ history; that is to say, for example, the history of Persia is to be studied\
        \ with reference not merely to Greece and Rome, but also to its own intrinsic\
        \ importance, and its influence upon the world. To assist the teacher, a few\
        \ questions have been added at the foot of each column, rather, however, as\
        \ suggestive of the kind of exercise to which the pupil should be subjected,\
        \ than as exhaustive of the subject. The varying size and number of the columns\
        \ devoted to each nation, is an indication of the relative importance of that\
        \ same nation at any given epoch ; thus Italy, in its earliest stage, occupies\
        \ but a narrow column, but when mistress of the world, she fills nine broad\
        \ columns. So also may be traced the fall and extinction of empires. A copious\
        \ index has been added, which is intended as a guide to the pronunciation\
        \ of names, as well as a reference to particulars ; but the system of accenting\
        \ the names has also been adopted in the text, \u2014 a dash being placed\
        \ over the strongly accented syl lables. The introduction into this work of\
        \ a history of the Christian Church requires some notice. It may seem out\
        \ of character to class such a history with that of the nations of the earth\
        \ ; but, in truth, in the early ages of the Church, the Christians were a\
        \ nation in themselves, as regarded the heathen world, and were assailed as\
        \ such. The bond of union between them was as strong as that which binds the\
        \ citizens of any land to each other. And when the triumph of the Church over\
        \ its religious foes was completed, it had its political foes to contend with,\
        \ and this fully occupied it during the Middle Ages. In that stormy period\
        \ it triumphed over emperors and kings, over nations and individuals, and\
        \ was as distinct a power as France or England. In modern times it has had\
        \ to contend with schismatics, heretics, reformers, and those who would, if\
        \ they could, destroy it altogether; and it has had as distinct characteristics\
        \ as any cotemporaneous nation has. It has, in short, been a Power throughout\
        \ the last eighteen centuries, and is, therefore, fully entitled to the place\
        \ in history which is here assigned to it. Perhaps it will be said that Mohammedanism,\
        \ Budhism, and other religions, have the same claim ; but their case will,\
        \ it is hoped, be found amply dis- posed of in the history of the respective\
        \ countries wherein they prevail. Universality is not their characteristic,\
        \ as it is of Chris tianity. In treating the history of the Christian Church,\
        \ the Author has endeavored to confine himself strictly to the state ment\
        \ of facts supported by the best authorities : he has scrupu lously avoided\
        \ all comment of his own, lest by any chance the In conclusion, the Author\
        \ desires to bear testimony to the very valuable aid he has derived from the\
        \ Philadelphia Library, and to the uniform kindness and attention he has received\
        \ from its accomplished librarian, Lloyd P. Smith, Esq., and his assistants,\
        \ during the years that he has been engaged upon this work. To him and to\
        \ the secretary, William E. Whitman, Esq., he is in debted for many valuable\
        \ suggestions and much information, whereby the work has beeu materially benefited.\
        \ Without easy and copious access to a great variety of authorities, it could\
        \ not have been compiled; but all that was required has been most courteously\

    - ["I 98 EGYPT. Ptolemv Soter, the son of Ptolemy Lagus, was the wisest statesman\
        \ among the successors of Alexander the Great. His first care, after he had\
        \ become firmly established on the throne of Egypt, was to regenerate the\
        \ entire social system of the nation. He revived its ancient religious and\
        \ political constitu tion, and restored the priesthood. Memphis was made the\
        \ capital, and a museum, university, and library were founded in Alexandria.\
        \ Thither the most cele brated men resorted for study and society. Euclid,\
        \ the geometer, Stilpo, Theo do'rus, and Diodo'rus, the philosophers, Phile'tas,\
        \ the poet, and Zenod'otus, the grammarian, resided there. The painters Antiphilus\
        \ and Apelles also practised their art in Alexandria ; Menander and Theophrastus\
        \ were likewise invited, but declined the invitation. The illustrious Demetrius\
        \ Phale'reus was one of the chief ornaments of the Court of Ptolemy Soter.\
        \ Deprived of the governorship of Athens, he fled to Egypt, where he was welcomed\
        \ by the mon arch ; and he rendered great assistance to him in his measures\
        \ for the encour agement of literature. Trade and navigation were encouraged\
        \ ; the harbor of Alexandria and a lighthouse on the island of Pharos were\
        \ constructed; to reach the latter a causeway a mile in length was made. The\
        \ Jews were allowed to have a temple in the city, and the Septuagint version\
        \ of the Old Testament from Hebrew into Greek was subsequently made for their\
        \ use. Papyrus for the leaves of books was brought into general use, instead\
        \ of linen, wax, or the bark of trees, stone, brass, or lead, as had been\
        \ previously the case. Alexandria became the centre of civilization and of\
        \ literature. The conquest of the Syrian fron tiers, the ancient kingdom of\
        \ Cyrene, great part of Ethiopia, and the island of Cyprus, added to the external\
        \ security of Egypt. Towards the end of Ptolemy Soter's reign, the worship\
        \ of Sera'pis was introduced into Egypt. It is said that the king was induced\
        \ by a vision to send to Pontus for an image of the god. (See Tacitus, Annals,\
        \ IV. 83.) Be that as it may, a Grecian idol was brought to Alexandria, and\
        \ set up in a very extensive and splendid temple, named (after the god) Serapium,\
        \ built purposely for its reception. It has been supposed that this idol was\
        \ called in the Coptic language Rhacotis, which word has the same signification\
        \ as Pluto, in Greek. (Whyte's Egyptiaca, Part I. p. 103.) The worship of\
        \ Serapis appears to have introduced a change into the religious cere monies\
        \ of Egypt. Hitherto animals had been held sacred, but with Serapis sacrifices\
        \ were introduced, and the ancient veneration for animal life died out. Ptolemy\
        \ was the greatest monarch of his age. In the year B. C. 285 he abdir cated\
        \ in favor of his youngest son, Ptolemv Philadelpuus, the child of his be\
        \ loved wife Berenice. He died two years afterwards (B.C. 283), greatly regretted.\
        \ to a close by a treaty by which Magas acquired undisputed possession of\
        \ the Cyrenaica, and his infant daughter Berenice was betrothed to Ptolemy's\
        \ son. The king was engaged in frequent wars with Antiochus, but he terminated\
        \ them at last by giving his daughter Berenice in marriage to that monarch.\
        \ During the remainder of Ptolemy's reign, Egypt enjoyed a large share of\
        \ prosperity. Ptolemy was wise enough to cultivate the friendship of the Romans,\
        \ then rapidly rising in power. He sent ambassadors to them, and received\
        \ those whom they sent in return with extraordinary splendor, loading them\
        \ with presents. He was one of the greatest potentates of that age. At the\
        \ close of his reign, it is said that he possessed a standing army of 200,000\
        \ infantry and 40,000 cavalry, a fleet of 1500 ships, and an amount of treasure\
        \ estimated at 740,000 talents ($811,000,000) (B. C. 247). He was succeeded\
        \ by his son, Ptolemy Euer'getes (the benefactor), a warlike and enterprising\
        \ prince, whose first exploit was to avenge the murder of his sister, Bereni'ce,\
        \ by Laod'ice, the wife of Antiochus, king of Syria. With a powerful army\
        \ he invaded the dominions of that monarch (B.C. 245), overran Syria, Babylonia,\
        \ Persia, and Upper Asia, and returned to Egypt with immense booty, bringing\
        \ back with him the idols which Cambyses bad carried away from Memphis and\
        \ Thebes 280 years before. The restoration of these idols to their respective\
        \ temples gained him very great popularity, and the appellation of Euergetes.\
        \ His queen, Berenice, had made a vow that if he should return in safety she\
        \ would devote her hair to Venus. Accordingly, when he returned she cut it\
        \ off and sent it to the temple of Venus at Zephyrum iD Cyprus, where it was\
        \ lost. To soothe the anger of Euergetes at this negligence, the astronomer\
        \ Conon of Samos pretended that the hair had been carried up to heaven and\
        \ converted into a constellation of seven stars near that of Leo. The king\
        \ and queen were much pleased with this gross flattery, and the constellation\
        \ was named \"Berenice's hair\" (Coma Berenices). He also subdued a great\
        \ part of Abyssinia and Arabia (B. C. 225), and opened new roads for trade\
        \ through these countries. With the death of Euergetes (B. C. 222) ended the\
        \ glory of the Ptolemies. His son Ptolemv, surnamed Philop'ator (lover of\
        \ his father), was a weak and dis solute prince, who was always under the\
        \ evil influence of favorites. At the in stigation of his prime minister,\
        \ Sosibius, he put to death his brother, Magas, and Cleom'enes, the exiled\
        \ king of Sparta. Antiochus the Great, kiug of Syria, took advantage of Ptolemy's\
        \ incapacity, and made war upon Egypt (B. C. 218), but he was defeated at\
        \ Raphia (B. C. 217). Ptolemy, after this victory, visited Jerusalem, and\
        \ made an attempt to enter the sanctuary of the Temple, but being prevented\
        \ by the priests, became so enraged, that on his return to Egypt he de termined\
        \ to exterminate all the Jews that had settled in his kingdom. For this purpose\
        \ they were brought from the most distant parts of the country to Alex andria,\
        \ and cast into the Hippodrome (or Circus), where 500 elephants were prepared\
        \ to destroy them. These animals were made drunk to increase their fury, but\
        \ instead of attacking the Jews they rushed upon the spectators, and committed\
        \ frightful havoc. Ptolemy, struck with remorse, restored to the Jews their\
        \ privileges. He did not carry out his wicked design, but soon afterwards\
        \ he murdered his wife and sister, and transferred his affections to Agathocle'a,\
        \ whose brother, the infamous Agatho'cles, had succeeded to the position and\
        \ influence of Sosib'ius. At length Ptolemy's dissipation broke down his consti\
        \ tution, and he died (B. C. 205) of premature infirmity, though in the very\
        \ prime of life. He was a monster of infamy. He left behind him an only son,\
        \ a child about 5 years old, who succeeded him. Ptolemy Epiph'anes (or the\
        \ illustrious) was placed under the care of regents, who proved unworthy of\
        \ their trust. The kingdom was menaced by Antiochus the Great, king of Syria,\
        \ who had combined with 'Philip of Macedon to wrest Egypt from the Ptolemies,\
        \ and had made himself master of C\u0153le-Syria and Palestine. The regency\
        \ of the country was therefore offered to and undertaken by the Roman Senate,\
        \ which saved Egypt from being involved in the Syrian war. Amongst the eminent\
        \ men of Egypt in this century were Euclid, the mathe matician ; Callim'achus,\
        \ grammarian, poet, and librarian ; Eratos'thenes of Cyrene, geographer ;\
        \ Sosib'ius, grammarian ; and Mane'tho, an Egyptian priest, the first who\
        \ gave in the Greek language an account of the religion and history of his\
        \ country, derived from the sacred books of the Egyptians. The reign of Ptolemy\
        \ Philadelphus was as prosperous as that of Ptolemy Lagus. The epithet Philadelphus\
        \ (signifying \"one who loves his brother\") was bestowed upon him in irony,\
        \ because he put to death two of his brothers. Great public works were undertaken.\
        \ Ports for the Indian and Arabian trade were made on the Red Sea at Arsin'oe\
        \ (now Suez), Myos-IIormos (now Cosseir), and Bereni'ce. From the two latter\
        \ stations, caravan roads were made to the Upper Nile, and the lower river\
        \ was united to the Red Sea by a canal which was continued to the harbor of\
        \ Alexandria. The character of Ptolemy Philadelphus was stained with vice.\
        \ He put to death his two brothers; divorced his first wife, Arsinoe, aud\
        \ banished her on a charge of treason ; and he married his own sister Arsinoe,\
        \ the widow of Lysimachus. For this second wife he evinced the greatest affec\
        \ tion, erecting monuments to her memory, and naming cities by her name. But\
        \ he had some redeeming qualities. He was fond of literature, and under his\
        \ patronage Alexandria became the resort of learned men. He went to great\
        \ trouble and expense in collecting books of value ; and he purchased from\
        \ Elea zar, the high-priest of the Jews, an authentic oopy of the Hebrew Scriptures.\
        \ This copy was by his orders translated into Greek, seventy-two learned men\
        \ being employed in the work. This version has been styled the Septuagint,\
        \ from the Latin word Septuaginta, signifying seventy, and in reference to\
        \ the number of translators, though, in strictness, there were seventy-two.\
        \ It became exten sively used, and is frequently alluded to and quoted by\
        \ the writers of the New Testament. In the year B. C. 204, the peace of the\
        \ country was disturbed by Magas, the brother of Ptolemy, who endeavored to\

        presence of the scenes described, so as to preserve for the reader, as far
        as possible, the fresh ness of first impressions, and invest the whole with
        an atmosphere of human interest. The route taken may be thus shortly indicated:
        Thorshavn; Portland Huk; the Westmanna Islands; Reykjavik ; the Geysers ;
        then, by sea, round the south coast of the island, with its magnificent Jokul-range
        of volcanoes; along the east coast, with its picturesque Fiords, as far north
        as Seydisfiord; and thence home again, by the Faroe Isles. The aim, throughout,
        has been both to present pictures and condense information on matters relating
        to Faroe and Iceland. In obtaining the latter I have had the advantages of
        frequent intercourse with Ice landers, both personal and by letter, since
        my visit to the North in the summer of 1859, and would here mention, in particular,
        the Rev. Olaf Palsson, Dean and Rector of Reykjavik Cathedral; Mr. J6n Arnason,
        Secretary to the Bishop, and Librarian; Mr. Gisli Brynjulfsson, the Icelandic
        poet and M.P. ; Mr. Sigurd ur Sivertsen, a retired merchant, and Mr. Jacobson.

        of Glasgow, Dr. Lauder Lindsay of Perth, and several other friends who have

        \ arising from a comprehensive plan of this kind, is that no one nation's\
        \ history assumes an undue preponderance over another. The pupil cannot be\
        \ misled into the notion that there are but three or four nations worth troubling\
        \ his head about, since, if he pay proper attention to the cotemporaneous\
        \ history, he will find how much the actions of one country have influenced\
        \ those of others, aud that impulses which actuate man at the pres ent day\
        \ may have been derived from remote antiquity, or from the most distant nations.\

        \ which, in these days of steam and electricity, is sensitively recognized\
        \ in every Ex change almost every hour. Another advantage, or, rather, pe\
        \ culiarity of the present plan, is that the history of each country is extracted\
        \ from its own annals, and complete in itself: it is, therefore, independent\
        \ of any other; hence, there is very fre- quently the repetition of an event\
        \ ; for instance, two accounts of the battle of Marathon will be found, one\
        \ in the history of Greece, the other in that of Persia, but in each case\
        \ it is consid- ered from the national point of view. With regard to the mode\
        \ in which the work ought to be used, a glance at the arrangement of it will\
        \ probably suggest the readiest way to the teacher, \u2014 or to the student,\
        \ where there is no teacher. In Ancient History there are a few leading nations\
        \ to whom the others were in turn subordinate ; as, for instance, first Egypt,\
        \ then Assyria, then Syria, then Greece, and then Rome. The Author suggests\
        \ that it would be well to study the histories of these leading countries\
        \ thoroughly, reading each of the cotemporaneous ones in a less particular\
        \ manner, yet so that the pupil shall be exercised as to the details thereof\
        \ century by century. But as the principal object of the work is to present\
        \ a general view of the affairs of the world during each century, and, in\
        \ so doing, to treat the subject in its entirety, and not with special reference\
        \ to any one leading nation, care must be taken to impress upon the pupil's\
        \ mind that, in selecting Egypt, Greece, or Italy, or any other country, as\
        \ the connect ing link, he must not lose sight of the independence of each\
        \ history; that is to say, for example, the history of Persia is to be studied\
        \ with reference not merely to Greece and Rome, but also to its own intrinsic\
        \ importance, and its influence upon the world. To assist the teacher, a few\
        \ questions have been added at the foot of each column, rather, however, as\
        \ suggestive of the kind of exercise to which the pupil should be subjected,\
        \ than as exhaustive of the subject. The varying size and number of the columns\
        \ devoted to each nation, is an indication of the relative importance of that\
        \ same nation at any given epoch ; thus Italy, in her earliest stage, occupies\
        \ but a narrow column, but when mistress of the world, she fills nine broad\
        \ columns. So also may be traced the fall and extinction of empires. A copious\
        \ index has been added, which is intended as a guide to the pronunciation\
        \ of names, as well as a reference to particulars; but the system of accenting\
        \ the names has also been adopted in the text, \u2014 a dash being placed\
        \ over the strongly accented syl lables. The introduction into this work of\
        \ a history of the Christian Church requires some notice. It may seem out\
        \ of character to class such a history with that of the nations of the earth\
        \ ; but, in truth, in the early ages of the Church, the Christians were a\
        \ nation in themselves, as regarded the heathen world, and were assailed as\
        \ such. The bond of union between them was as strong as that which binds the\
        \ citizens of any land to each other. And when the triumph of the Church over\
        \ its religious foes was completed, it had its political foes to contend with,\
        \ aud this fully occupied it during the Middle Ages. In that stormy period\
        \ it triumphed over emperors and kings, over nations and individuals, and\
        \ was as distinct a power as France or England. In modern times it has had\
        \ to contend with schismatics, heretics, reformers, and those who would, if\
        \ they could, destroy it altogether ; and it has had as distinct characteristics\
        \ as any cotemporaneous nation has. It has, in short, been a Power throughout\
        \ the last eighteen centuries, and is, therefore, fully entitled to the place\
        \ in history which is here assigned to it. Perhaps it will be said that Mohammedanism,\

        \ it is hoped, be found amply dis posed of in the history of the respective\
        \ countries wherein they prevail. Universality is not their characteristic,\
        \ as it is of Chris tianity. In treating the history of the Christian Church,\

        \ for au image of the god. (See Tacitus, Annals, IV. 83.) Be that as it may,\
        \ a Grecian idol was brought to Alexandria, and set up in a very extensive\
        \ and splendid temple, named (after tho god) Serapium, built purposely for\
        \ its reception. It has been supposed that this idol was called in the Coptic\
        \ language Bhacotis, which word has the same signification as Pluto, in Greek.\
        \ (Whyte's Egyptiaca, Part I. p. 103.) The worship of Serapis appears to have\
        \ introduced a change into the religious cere monies of Egypt. Hitherto animals\
        \ had been held sacred, but with Serapis sacrifices Avere introduced, and\
        \ the ancient veneration for animal life died out. Ptolemy Avas the greatest\
        \ monarch of his age. In the year B. C. 285 he abdi cated in favor of his\
        \ youngest son, Ptolemy Philadelpiius, tho child of his be loved Avife Berenice.\
        \ He died two years afterwards (B. C. 283), greatly regretted. to a close\
        \ by a treaty by which Magas acquired undisputed possession of the Cyrena'ica,\
        \ and his infant daughter Berenice was betrothed to Ptolemy's son. The king\
        \ Avas engaged in frequent Avars with Antiochus, but he terminated them at\
        \ last by giving his daughter Berenice in marriage to that monarch. During\
        \ the remainder of Ptolemy's reign, Egypt enjoyed a large share of prosperity.\
        \ Ptolemy was wise enough to cultivate the friendship of the Bomans, then\
        \ rapidly rising in power. He sent ambassadors to them, and received those\
        \ whom they sent in return with extraordinary splendor, loading them with\
        \ presents. He was one of the greatest potentates of that age. At the close\
        \ of his reign, it is said that he possessed a standing army of 200,000 infantry\
        \ and 40,000 caA*alry, a fleet of 1500 ships, and an amount of treasure estimated\
        \ at 740,000 talents (\xA7811,000,000) (B. C. 247). He was succeeded by his\
        \ son, Ptolemy Euer'getes (tho benefactor), a warlike and enterprising prince,\
        \ whose first exploit was to aA*enge the murder of his sister, Bereni'ce,\
        \ by Laod'ice, the Avife of Antiochus, king of Syria. With a powerful army\
        \ he invaded the dominions of that monarch (B.C. 245), overran Syria, Babylonia,\
        \ Persia, and Upper Asia, and returned to Egypt with immense booty, bringing\
        \ back with him the idols which Cambyses bad carried aAvay from Memphis and\
        \ Thebes 280 years before. The restoration of these idols to their respective\
        \ temples gained him very great popularity, and the appellation of Euergetes.\
        \ His queen, Berenice, had made a vow that if he should return in safety she\
        \ would devote her hair to Venus. Accordingly, when he returned she cut it\
        \ off and sent it to the temple of Venus at Zephyrum iD Cyprus, Avhere it\
        \ was lost. To soothe the anger of Euergetes at this negligence, the astronomer\
        \ Conon of Samos pretended that the hair had been carried up to heaA*en and\
        \ converted into a constellation of seven stars near that of Leo. The king\
        \ and queen were much pleased with this gross flattery, and the constellation\
        \ Avas named \"Berenice's hair\" (Coma Berenices). He also subdued a great\
        \ part of Abyssinia and Arabia (B. C. 225), and opened new roads for trade\
        \ through these countries. With the death of Euergetes (B. C. 222) ended the\
        \ glory of the Ptolemies. His son Ptolemy, surnamed PniLOP'ATOR (loverof hisfather),\
        \ wasa weakand dis solute prince, Avho was always under the evil influence\
        \ of favorites. At the in stigation of his prime minister, Sosibius, he put\
        \ to death his brother, Magas, and Cleom'enes, the exiled king of Sparta.\
        \ Antiochus the Great; king of Syria, took advantage of Ptolemy's incapacity,\
        \ and made war upon Egypt (B. C. 218), but he was defeated at Baphia (B. C.\
        \ 217). Ptolemy, after this victory, visited Jerusalem, and made an attempt\
        \ to enter the sanctuary of the Temple, but being prevented by the priests,\
        \ became so enraged, that on his return to Egypt he de termined to exterminate\
        \ all the Jews that had settled in his kingdom. For this purpose they were\
        \ brought from the most distant parts of the country to Alex andria, and cast\
        \ into the Hippodrome (or Circus), where 500 elephants were prepared to destroy\
        \ them. These animals were made drunk to increase their fury, but instead\
        \ of attacking the Jews they rushed upon the spectators, and committed frightful\
        \ havoc. Ptolemy, struck with remorse, restored to the JeAvs their privileges.\
        \ He did not carry out his wicked design, but soon afterwards he murdered\
        \ his wife and sister, and transferred his affections to Agathocle'a, Avhose\
        \ brother, the infamous Agath'ocles, had succeeded to the position and influence\
        \ of Sosib'ius. At length Ptolemy's dissipation broke down his consti tution,\
        \ and he died (B. C.205) of premature infirmity, though in the very prime\
        \ of life. He was a monster of infamy. He left behind him an only son, a child\
        \ about 5 years old, Avho succeeded him. The reign of Ptolemy Philadelpiius\
        \ Avas as prosperous as that of Ptolemy Lagus. The epithet Philadelpiius (signifying\
        \ \" one who loves his brother\") was bestowed upon him in irony, because\
        \ he put to death two of his brothers. Great public works were undertaken.\
        \ Ports for the Indian and Arabian trade were made on the Red Sea at Arsin'oe\
        \ (now Suez), Myos-Hormos (now Cosseir), and Bereni'ce. From the two latter\
        \ stations, caravan roads were made to the Upper Nile, and the lower river\
        \ was united to the Red Sea by a canal Avhieh was continued to the harbor\
        \ of Alexandria. The character of Ptolemy Philadelpiius was stained with vice.\
        \ He put to death his two brothers ; diA*orced his first wife, Arsinoe, and\
        \ banished her on a charge of treason ; and he married his own sister Arsinoe,\
        \ the AvidoAV of Lysimachus. For this second wife he evinced the greatest\
        \ affec tion, erecting monuments to her memory, and naming cities by her name.\
        \ But he had some redeeming qualities. He Avas fond of literature, and under\
        \ his patrouage Alexandria became the resort of learned men. lie went to great\
        \ trouble and expense in collecting books of value ; and he purchased from\
        \ Elea. zar, the high-priest of the Jews, an authentic copy of the Hebrew\
        \ Scriptures. This copy Avas by his orders translated into Greek, seventy-two\
        \ learned men being employed in the work. This version has been styled the\
        \ Septuagint, from the Latin word Septuaginta, signifying seventy, and in\
        \ reference to the number of translators, though, in strictness, there were\
        \ seventy-two. It became exten sively used, and is frequently alluded to and\
        \ quoted by the writers of the New Testament. Ptolemy Epiph'anes (or the illustrious)\
        \ was placed under the care of regents, who proved unworthy of their trust.\
        \ The kingdom was menaced by Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, who had combined\
        \ with Philip of Macedon to Avrest Egypt from the Ptolemies, and had made\
        \ himself master of C\u0153le-Syria and Palestine. The regency of the country\
        \ was therefore offered to and undertaken by the Roman Senate, which saved\
        \ Egypt from being involved in the Syrian war. Amongst the eminent men of\
        \ Egypt in this century were Euclid, the mathe matician; Callim'achus, grammarian,\
        \ poet, and librarian ; Eratos'thenes of Cyrene, geographer ; Sosib'ius, grammarian\
        \ ; and Mane'tho, an Egyptian priest, the first who gave in the Greek language\
        \ an account of the religion and history of his country, derived from the\
        \ sacred books of the Egyptians. In the year B. C. 204, the peace of the country\
        \ was disturbed by Magas, the brother of Ptolemy, who endeavored to re-establish\

        \ on the west, by Strathmiglo and Auch tennuchty on the north, by Kettle on\
        \ the east, and by Markinch and Leslie on the south. Its length eastward is\
        \ about six miles, and its greatest breadth about four miles. Its ancient\
        \ name was Kilgour, signifying, \"the pleasant Church ;\" and its modern name,\
        \ which seems to have some reference to the manly sport of hawking, was applied\

        \ of the County. It is bounded on the south by the parish of Monimail, on\
        \ the east by Cupar and Kilmany, on \u25A0 the north by Kilmany and Creich,\
        \ and on the west by Creich. It contains the smallest number of inhabitants\
        \ of any parish in the County, and is also the most diminutive in size of\
        \ any rural parish ; being barely two miles in length, by one and a half at\
        \ its greatest breadth. Its surface presents a pleasing diversity of hill\
        \ and dale, and has an extreme elevation of 400 feet above the sea. Several\
        \ beautiful eminences are situated in the west, the descent from which is\
        \ a gentle slope, terminating in a considerable valley. A few acres on the\
        \ top of Colluthie Hill are rocky, and have been planted with trees ; but\
        \ other wise the Parish is nearly destitute of wood. An extensive marsh formerly\
        \ existed on the farm of Lordscairnie, but it was drained about 60 years ago,\
        \ and converted into arable land ; and all the rest of the surface is excellent\
        \ soil, partly a strong clay, but chiefly a black loam, in a high state of\
        \ cultivation. The prevailing rock is trap, in the condition popularly called\
        \ rotten. An interesting antiquity is Lordscairnie Castle, commonly called\
        \ Earl Beardie's Castle ; and is said to have been built by Alexander, 3d\
        \ Earl of Crawford, commonly called Earl Beardie, from his great beard. All\
        \ that now remains of it is the keep or donjon, and a round tower, which had\
        \ formed a defence for the wall by which the court yard was surrounded. This\
        \ ruin is four stories high, and appears to have lost nothing of its original\
        \ height, with the exception of the bartizan which surrounded its roof. It\
        \ is 53 feet in length, and 42 in breadth outside the walls. The walls are\
        \ strongly built, and are from five to six feet thick. The ground floor, as\
        \ is common in such structures, appears to have been entirely occupied by\
        \ cellars, having arched stone roofs. The second floor was occupied with the\
        \ great hall, which is 40 feet in length, by above 20 in breadth. The defence\
        \ of the castle and its outworks was anciently strengthened by a broad morass,\
        \ which appears to have entirely surrounded the slight rising ground on which\
        \ they were situated. Another object of great antiquity is the House of Colluthie,\
        \ the pro perty of John Inglis, Esq. The date of its erection is unknown,\
        \ but it must be a very old building. It is chiefly remarkable for the great\
        \ thickness of its walls, and for some arched doors and windows. It long stood\
        \ in a neglected and nearly uninhabitable state ; but was repaired a number\
        \ of years ago, so as to become a good mansion. The Parish is entirely rural,\
        \ the small number of inhabitants being all connected", 1]

        Young, A., Librarian, Forth Iron Works Library PARISH OF CERES Ceres is an
        inland Parish, containing, in addition to the village of its own name, those
        of Craigrothie, Chance Inn, Baldinnie, and Pitscottie. Bridgend is often treated
        as a separate village, but as it is purely a continuation of that of Ceres,
        and only separated from it by Ceres Burn, the two strictly form only one village.
        It is bounded on the north by Cupar, on the east by Kemback, St Andrews, and
        Cameron, on the south by Largo and Scoonie, and on the west by Kettle and
        Cults. Its length north-eastward is from seven to eight miles, and its breadth
        from a half to four miles. The river Eden skirts it for a mile and a half,
        dividing it from Cupar, on the north-west. Several streamlets run into the
        interior, from the west, the south, and the east, and uniting a little above
        the village of Ceres, form Ceres Burn, which runs through the village, winds
        eastward to Pitscottie, there enters the beautiful den of Dura, and falls
        into the Eden a little above Dairsie Castle. The surface of the Parish is
        pleasingly diversified by hill and dale. The culti- vated portion of the land,
        which amounts to fully one half, is highly fertile, and in many places carries
        luxuriant crops. The remainder is chiefly in pasture, with a small portion
        in wood. There is plenty of limestone in the Parish, which is ex- tensively
        worked, and coal, which is found in many places, is wrought at Ladeddie. The
        chief mansion-houses are Teasses and Edenwood. The latter was long the residence
        of the late Sir George Campbell, brother to the present Lord Chancellor of
        England. The ruins of Craighall, built by the celebrated Scotch Lawyer, Sir
        Thomas Hope, stand on the ridge of a craig overlooking a ravine, about a mile
        to the south-east of the village of Ceres. On the south-west are the ruins
        of Struthers House, once the favourite residence of the family of the Lindsays,
        when royalty kept court at Falkland Palace, but now belonging to the Earl
        of Glasgow. To the north-west of Craigrothie, on a height commanding at a
        glance the valleys of the Eden and Ceres, stands Scots Tarvit House or Tower,
        24 feet square and 50 feet high, with very thick walls and small windows.
        This tower was once the family residence of the Scots of Scots Tarvit, and
        in it, upwards of two centuries ago, Sir John Scott wrote that remarkable
        little book, "The Staggering State of Scots Statesmen." Lindsay of Pitscottie,
        who, three centuries ago, wrote a History of Scotland, was also a native of
        this Parish. The site of the "old narrow house" covered with thatch, in which
        the old chronicler lived, is now occupied by the modern farm house of Pitscottie.',

        This Parish, containing the villages of Blebo Craigs, Blebo Mills, and Kemback
        Mills, is situated in the Stratheden district of the County. It is bounded
        by the parishes of Dairsie and Leuchars on the north, by St Andrews and Ceres
        on the east, by Ceres on the south, and by Ceres and Cupar on the west. Its
        length east north-eastward is three miles, and its breadth seldom exceeds
        one and a half mile. All the northern border is bounded by the Eden. The surface
        at the western portion is nearly level, with a gentle declination towards
        the Eden ; but about the centre it rises into Kemback Hill, which is finely
        wooded, and beautifully varied and picturesque. Dura Den, a sweet, romantic
        glen, intersects the Parish, beginning at Pitseottie Mills, and ending a little
        below Kemback Mills. The Kame, or as it is more', 1]

        \ containing the villages of Luthrie and Brunton. It reaches to within less\
        \ than a mile of the Firth of Tay. It is bounded on the north by the parish\
        \ of Flisk, on the east by Balmerino and Kilmany, on the south by Moonzie\
        \ and Monimail, and on the west by Abdie and Dunbog. Its length northward\
        \ is about three miles, and its breadth about two miles. The surface is a\
        \ congeries of hills of various forms and sizes, none higher than about 550\
        \ feet above sea level, some being cultivated to the summit, others covered\
        \ with wood, and others rocky or moorish. Two of the summits, Black Craig\
        \ and Green Craig, command superb views of the bason of the Tay, away to the\
        \ Sidlaws and the Grampians. The Parish is drained by the head streams of\
        \ the Motray, a tributary of the Eden. Whinstone and graystone are quan'ied.\
        \ The estate and castle of Creich, the ruins of which stand on the north end\
        \ of the Parish, anciently belonged to the Bethunes, of which family was Janet\
        \ Bethune, the Lady Buccleuch celebrated in the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel,\"\
        \ and Mary Bethune, one of \"the Queen's Four Marys.\" The Rev. Alexander\
        \ Henderson, celebrated for his great talents and staunch opposition to Episcopacy,\
        \ was born in this Parish, in 1583. On a little eminence near the Church are\
        \ the vestiges of a Roman Camp, with two lines of circumvalation, and about\
        \ a mile further west, on a higher hill, is another of the same .kind. The\
        \ Parish Church, which is near Luthrie, was built in 1830-32. It is a hand\
        \ some structure, and contains 252 sittings. There is a Free Church, jointly\
        \ for Creich and Flisk, at Brunton. In addition to the Parish School which\
        \ is at Luthrie, there is a Free Church School at Brunton. The inhabitants\
        \ are chiefly employed in agricultural and other out-door labours ; there\
        \ are also a few weavers and other tradesmen in Luthrie and Brunton. The POST\
        \ TOWN is Cupar, with Sub-Offices at Luthrie and Brunton. The Sub- Post Masters\
        \ are David Smith, Luthrie, and John Heggie, Brunton. \u2014 A walking postman\
        \ leaves Cupar about 9.20 a.m., and delivers letters along the route by Moonzie\
        \ to Luthrie and Brunton. He leaves Bninton on his return at 12. 55 p.m.,\

        \ the Baron Burgh of Leven, is on the south coast of the County. It is bounded\
        \ by the Firth of Forth on the south, by Wemyss, Markinch, Kennoway, and Kettle\
        \ on the west, by Kennoway and Ceres on the north, and by Largo on the east.\
        \ Its length from south to north is nearly five miles, and its greatest breadth\
        \ about two and a half miles. The coast which lies along the western side\
        \ of Largo Bay, has an extent of less than one and a half mile, and is everywhere\
        \ flat and sandy. The surface, inland, rises with a gentle ascent from the\
        \ shore to the northern extremity. The highest ground has an elevation of\
        \ above 600 feet and there are several heights and swells which command .an\
        \ extensive and brilliant view of the Firth of Forth and the Lothians. Beds\
        \ of coal of varied thicknesses lie beneath the whole parish, and were worked\
        \ at Scoonie Bridge up to a recent period ; and a Colliery at Kilmux, on the\
        \ northern border, is in active operation. A fine bed of Ochre, five feet\
        \ thick, occurs on the estates of Durie and Aithernie, and there are mills\
        \ for grinding it at Leven. The total area is esti mated at about 4000 acres,\
        \ all of which are cultivated, except about 500, which are partly in wood,\
        \ and partly in pasture and uncultivated links. A battle is supposed to have\
        \ been fought in ancient times between the Danes and the Scots on the west\
        \ border ; about twenty stone coffins, together with other sepulchral remains,\
        \ being exhumed in 1821, on the top of a conical hill. The mansion houses\
        \ are Durie, Kilmux, and Montrave. The Parish is traversed by the road from\
        \ Largo to Windygates, by the road from Kirkcaldy by Kennoway, to Cupar, and\
        \ by the Leven and East of Fife Railway, which has a station on the north\
        \ side of the town of Leven. The town of Leven, which is a sea-port, stands\
        \ at the mouth of the Leven, on the west side of Largo Bay\u2014 two miles\
        \ south-east of Kennoway, two and a half miles south-west of Lower Largo,\
        \ and nine miles north-east of Kirkcaldy. It is a Burgh of Barony under Mr\
        \ Christie, of Durie. It lies on the shore, on the east side of the Leven,\
        \ and is connected with Dubbieside, or Innerleven, by a fine stone bndge.\
        \ The town consists chiefly of three streets running nearly parallel to each\
        \ other, east and west, and a number of bye-lanes. There is a police commission\
        \ in the Burgh, under the Act William IV, Chap. 36. A number of handsome houses\
        \ and cottages have been erected along the links, at the south-east part of\
        \ the town, within a recent period Like most towns on the south coast of the\
        \ County, it is a favourite resort for visitors during the summer season,\
        \ for sea-bathing ; and a number of the inhabitants let their houses furnished,\
        \ to parties requiring accommodation for that purpose. A number of the inhabitants\
        \ are engaged in hand-loom weaving,", 1]

        \ bounded on the north by St Andrews, on the east by Kingsbarns, on the south\
        \ by Crail and Carnbee, and on the west by Cameron. It measures about three\
        \ miles both in length and breadth, and reaches to within one and a half miles\
        \ of the sea at its north-eastern boundary. The surface is somewhat uneven\
        \ and hilly, the ground rising to the north to an elevation of nearly 300\
        \ feet above sea-level. The land is in a high state of culti vation, and is\
        \ beautifully interspersed with woodland and streams. Of these latter the\
        \ largest is Pitmilly Burn, which enters the Parish from Cameron, and flows\
        \ east ward to the sea. From the number of old coal-pits existing, it is evident\
        \ that coal must have been at a former period very abundant, but nothing is\
        \ now done in this department. Sandstone and iron-stone also abound, but neither\
        \ are much worked. The Parish has no village, and is thinly inhabited, the\
        \ inhabitants being almost all engaged in agricultural operations. The Parish\
        \ Church and School-House are at Denino, and there is no other Church or School\
        \ in the Parish. The POST TOWN is St Andrews, with a Sub-Office at Denino,\

        \ of British artists) opened Jan. 18, 1806, on a plan formed by sir Thomas\
        \ Bernard. In the gallery (erected by alderman BoydeU, to exhibit the paintings\
        \ executed for his edition ot Shakspeare), are exhibited pictures by the old\
        \ masters and deceased British artists. BRITISH LEGION, raised by lord John\
        \ Hay, col. De Lacy Evans, and others, to assist queen Isabella of Spain against\
        \ the Carlists in 1835. On May 5, 1836, it defeated them at Hernani, and at\
        \ St. Sebastian's on Oct. I, same year. BRITISH MUSEUM, originated with the\
        \ grant by parliament (April 5, 1753) of 20,000.. to the daughters of sir\
        \ Hans Sloane, in payment for his fine library, and vast collection of the\
        \ productions of nature and art, which had cost him 50,000.. The library contained\
        \ 50,000 volumes and valuable MSS., and 69,352 articles of virtu enumerated\
        \ in the catalogue. Montagu-house was obtained by government as a place for\
        \ their reception. The museum was 1 ipened in 1 759, and has since been enormously\
        \ increased by gifts, bequests, and purchases ; by tin* Cottonian, Harleian,\
        \ and other libraries ; by the Townley marbles (in 1812) ; by the Elgin marbles\
        \ (181 6) ; bythe Lycian marbles obtained by sir C. Fellows (1842-6); by the\
        \ Assyrian antiquities collected by Mr. Austin Layard between 1847 and 1850\
        \ ; by the antiquities brought from Halicarnassus (now Budrum), including\
        \ remains of the celebrated tomb of Mausolus, by Mr. C. T. Newton (Nov. 1858)\
        \ ; by antiquities from Carthage (1860) and Gyrene (1861).\u2014 George II.\
        \ presented the Royal Library in 1757, and in 1823, George IV. presented tin*\
        \ library collected at Buckingham-house by George III., consisting of 65,250\
        \ volumes, and about 19,000 pamphlets. In 1846 the right hon. Thos. GrenviUe\
        \ bequeathed to the museum his library, consisting of 20,240 volumes. Great\
        \ additions to, and improvements in, the buildings \"have since been made,\
        \ independently of the annual giant.* The gigantic iron railing enclosing\
        \ the frontage, was completed in 1852. The magnificent reading-room, erected\
        \ by Mr. Sydney Smirke, according to apian by Mr. Antonio Panizzi, the present\
        \ librarian, ata cost of about 150,000?., was opened to the public, May 11,\
        \ 1857. The height of the dome is 106 feet, and the diameter 140 feet. The\
        \ room contains about 80,000 volumes, and accommodates 300 readers. \u2014\
        \ The daily increasing library contained in 1860 above 562,000 volumes, exclusive\
        \ of tracts, MSS., &c. A new alphabetical catalogue was completed from A to\
        \ H in June, 1859. In 1861 the incorporation of the four library catalogues\
        \ into one alphabet began \u2014 three copies being made. The proposed separation\
        \ of the antiquarian, literary, and scientific collections, was disapproved\
        \ of by a commission in 1860 ; and a biR to remove the Natural History CoUections\
        \ to South Kensington was rejected by the commons on May 19, 1S62. BKITISH\

        \ immunities from the time of William the Conqueror, whose first charter,\
        \ granted in A.D. 1079, is still preserved in the city archives. This charter\
        \ is written in beautiful Saxon characters, on a slip of parchment six inches\
        \ long, and one broad, and is in English as follows : \u2014 \" William the\
        \ king greeteth William the bishop, and Godfrey the portrevo, and all the\
        \ burgesses within London, friendly. And I acquaint you, that I will that\
        \ ye be all there law-worthy, as ye were in king Edward's days. And I will\
        \ that every child be his father's heir, after his father's days. And I will\
        \ not suffer that any man do you any wrong. God preserve you.\" This is the\
        \ first of many charters granted to London, in 16S0 Charles II. granted a\
        \ charter confirming all the previous ones. In 1682 the citizens having given\
        \ offence by a petition to the king against the prorogation of parliament,\
        \ all their charters were seized under a writ of Quo warranto. They were returned\
        \ by James II. in 1688 ; and in 1690 the city recovered its lost privileges.\
        \ LONDON GATES. The original walls of London were the work of the Romans.\
        \ Theo dosius, governor of Britain, is said to have raised them a.d. 379 ;\
        \ but they are supposed to have been built about 306. There were originaUy\
        \ four principal gates ; but in process of time, as new roads were made, the\
        \ numbers increased ; and among others were the Pr\xE6torian way, Newgate,\

        \ remaining. LONDON INSTITUTION, \"for the advancement of literature and the\
        \ diffusion of useful knowledge,\" in imitation of the Royal Institution (which\
        \ see), was founded in 1805 by sir Francis Baring, bart. and others ; first\
        \ at 8, Old Jewry, Cheapside. The celebrated prof. Porson was the first librarian.\
        \ The present building was completed in 1819, and opened on April 21 ; the\
        \ first lecture was delivered by Mr. W. T. Brande, on May 5, following. Mr.\
        \ AV. R. Grove, Q.C. (the inventor of the Voltaic battery which bears his\
        \ name), was the first professor of experimental philosophy here, and held\
        \ that position from 1840 to 1846. The Institution possesses an excellent\

        \ was founded by the exertions of lord Brougham, Thomas Campbell, and others.\
        \ The building, originally called the London University, was commenced April\
        \ 30, 1827 (when the first stone was laid by the duke of Sussex) ; and was\
        \ opened by an inaugural lecture from professor Bell, Oct. 1, 1828. Its plan\
        \ of instruction includes a junior school, to prepare pupils for the college\
        \ ; and the college course, compre hends arts, law, medicine, mathematics,\
        \ natural philosophy, and languages. In Gordon square adjacent is University\
        \ Hall, founded in 1847, where divinity and moral philosophy form distinct\
        \ courses. On the application of the London University for a charter, govern\
        \ ment resolved upon granting two charters\u2014 one for the establishment\
        \ of a university in London (see the article), and the other of this college,\
        \ both charters being granted on the same day, Nov. 28, 1836 ; the latter\

        \ The town was surprised, and sir George Powlett, the governor, and the entire\
        \ garrison were put to the sword by rebels, in 1606. It was besieged by O'Neal\
        \ in 1641. A grant was made of Deny, with 210,000 acres of land, to various\
        \ companies in London, in 1689, when it took its present name. Memorable siege\
        \ of Derry, commenced April 20, 1689, was sustained against the army of James\
        \ II., who for a time commanded in person. The heroic garrison and inhabitants\
        \ were, on this memorable occasion, driven to the extremity of famine ; but\
        \ under the direction of the rev. George Walker, they defended the place against\
        \ the enemy until the siege was raised by gen. Kirke. James's army, under\
        \ the French general Rosen, retired with the loss of about 9000 men, after\
        \ having practised almost unparalleled cruelties upon the inhabitants of the\
        \ villages around. E E", 1]

        \ Pursuivant at Arms. In this office he enjoyed near fifty years the rare\
        \ felicity of uniting, in the same pursuit, his duty and inclination : his\
        \ name is remembered in the College, and many of his letters are still preserved.\
        \ Several of the most respect able characters of the age, Sir William Dugdale,\
        \ Mr. Ashmole, Dr. John Betts, and Dr. Nehemiah Grew, were his friends ; and\
        \ in the society of such men, John Gibbon may be recorded without disgrace\
        \ as the member of an astrological club. The study of hereditary honours is\
        \ favourable to the Royal prerogative ; and my kinsman, like most of his family,\
        \ was a high Tory both in church and state. In the latter end of the reign\
        \ of Charles the Second his pen was exercised in the cause of the Duke of\
        \ York : the Republican faction he most cordially detested ; and as each animal\
        \ is conscious of its proper arms, the herald's revenge was emblazoned on\
        \ a most dia bolical escutcheon. But the triumph of the Whig government checked\
        \ the preferment of Blue-mantle ; and he was even suspended from his office\
        \ till his tongue could learn to pronounce the oath of abjura tion. His life\
        \ was prolonged to the age of ninety ; and in the expectation of the inevitable\
        \ though uncertain hour, he wishes to preserve the blessings of health, competence,\
        \ and virtue. In the year 1682 he published at London his Introductio ad Latinam\
        \ Blasoniam, an original attempt, which Camden had desiderated, to define,\
        \ in a Roman idiom, the terms and attributes of a Gothic insti tution. It\
        \ is not two years since I acquired, in a foreign land, some domestic intelligence\
        \ of my own family ; and this intelligence was conveyed Lo Switzerland from\
        \ the heart of Germany. I had formed an acquaintance with Mr. hanger, a lively\
        \ and ingenious scholar, while he resided at Lausanne as preceptor to the\
        \ Hereditary Prince of Brunswick. On his return to his proper station of Librarian\
        \ to the Ducal Library of Wolfenbuttel, he accidentally found among some literary\
        \ rubbish a small old English volume of heraldry, inscribed with the name\
        \ of John Gribbon. From the title only Mr. Longer judged that it might be\
        \ an acceptable present to his friend ; and he judged rightly. His manner\
        \ is quaint and affected ; his order is confused : but he displays some wit,\
        \ more reading, and still more enthusiasm ; and if an enthusiast be often\
        \ absurd, he is never languid.", 1]

        \ were stationary or retrograde, while the Latins were advancing with a rapid\
        \ and progressive motion. The nations were excited by the spirit of independence\
        \ and emulation ; and even the little world of the Italian states contained\
        \ more people and industry than the decreasing circle of the Byzantine empire.\
        \ In Europe the lower ranks of society were relieved from the yoke of feudal\
        \ servitude ; and freedom is the first step to curiosity and knowledge. The\
        \ use, however rude and corrupt, of the Latin tongue had been preserved by\
        \ superstition ; the universities, from Bologna to Oxford,84 were peopled\
        \ with thousands of scholars ; and their misguided ardour might be directed\
        \ to more liberal and manly studies. In the resurrection of science Italy\
        \ was the first that cast away her shroud ; and the eloquent Petrarch, by\
        \ his lessons and his example, may justly be applauded as the first harbinger\
        \ of day. A purer style of composition, a more generous and rational strain\
        \ of sentiment, flowed from the study and imitation of the writers of ancient\
        \ Rome ; and the disciples of Cicero and Virgil approached, with reverence\
        \ and love, the sanctuary of their Grecian masters. In the sack of Constantinople\
        \ the French, aud even the Venetians, had despised and destroyed the works\
        \ of Lysippus and Homer ; the monuments of art may be annihilated by a single\
        \ blow, but the im mortal mind is renewed and multiplied by the copies of\
        \ the pen, and such copies it was the ambition of Petrarch and his friends\
        \ to possess and understand. The arms of the Turks undoubtedly pressed the\
        \ flight of the Muses : yet we may tremble at the thought that Greece might\
        \ have been overwhelmed, with her schools and libraries, before Europe had\
        \ emerged from the deluge of barbarism ; that the seeds of science might have\
        \ been scattered by the winds before the Italian soil was prepared for their\
        \ cultivation. The most learned Italians of the fifteenth century have confessed\
        \ and applauded the restoration of Greek literature, after Revival ot a long\
        \ oblivion of many hundred years. 8i Yet in that country, and beyond the Alps,\
        \ some names are quoted; Italy some profound scholars who, in the darker ages,\
        \ were honourably 84 At the end of the xvth century there existed in Europe\
        \ about fifty universities, and of these the foundation of ten or twelve is\
        \ prior to the year 1300. They were crowded in proportion to their scarcity.\
        \ Bologna contained 10,000 students, chiefly of the civil law. In the year\
        \ 1357 the number at Oxford had decreased from 30,000 to 6000 scholars (Henry's\
        \ History of Great Britain, vol. iv. p. 478). Yet even this decrease is much\
        \ superior to the present list of the members of the university. 85 Of those\
        \ writers who professedly treat of the restoration of the Greek learning in\
        \ Italy, the two principal are Hodius, Dr. Humphrey Hody (de Gr\xE6cis Illustribus,\

        bequeathed to the town by a gentleman of the neigh bourhood. The librarian,
        an intedigent, elderly man, and re lative of the late donor, was pleased to
        find us curious about Slavonic literature ; nay, he wrote down our names,
        to be shown as those of English people to a Slovak literatus, a dear friend
        of his own, and one who, like himsed, bemoaned the indifference, too general
        among travellers, towards what concerns the Slovaks. He exhibited the Lord''s
        Prayer written in some hundred languages, and made us compare the Slavonic
        versions with each other ; this was our first lesson in reading Slovak, but
        when a speech is ad day ringing in one''s ears, the tongue catches it easdy,
        at least for the time being. According to Safarik, the Slovakian language
        was spoken in 1842 by two million seven hundred and fifty-three Slovaks. Like
        Polish and Bohemian, it is written in Eoman characters ; and some authors
        have even termed it a dialect of the Cech, in which tongue its church and
        school books wrere formerly printed, which was also adopted by most Slovak
        literati in order to secure a wider circle of readers. Among the', 1]

        give ourselves infinite trouble, but would not make any sensible diminution

        they come from. I cannot take your advice either," he added, " of lying down

        joke, capital fun ! A vil lain certainly. Yet on subsequently speaking of
        the affair to a Russian friend, he tried to assure us that the man could not
        have used the word, for it was not the right word for good in that sense,
        and im plies rather a species of moral excellence and spiri tual righteousness.
        We persisted, however, that " dobre " was the word, and then a bystander sug

        all the nails, and presented the open box and its sepa rated cover without
        a crack or an injury, all this be fore we had finished admiring the fine dome-shaped
        room we were in. It was twenty-five feet square in the floor, and as many
        high, with several well covered writing-tables, a large bookcase signifi cantly
        marked, " Works of the Central Observa tory," containing the original of all
        observations made at Pulkova ; while the walls are adorned with many portraits
        of men eminent in science, or revered for the assistance they had given at
        the building of the Observatory. Chief amongst them stood the late Admiral
        Greig, whose expressive countenance seemed to tell forcibly of a deeply -thinking,
        firmly resolving, good, religious man, of Scottish extrac tion, and who, as
        the elder Struve''s large work has duly recorded, worthily presided for many
        years over the scientific Commission " appointed to watch the progress of

        \ within the convent walls \u2014had become, in a state of mental and bodily\
        \ lassitude, half recon ciled to its dull routine, and, notwithstanding the\
        \ smallness of our stock of ideas and topics in common, had by little and\
        \ little esta blished a decidedly friendly feeling with the Superior, the\
        \ Ikonomos, the Librarian, the cook, and the old gardener ; meeting them every\
        \ evening on the convent terrace overlooking the garden, when the sun declined,\
        \ and the shadows crept up the surrounding peaks, and all was hushed and cool,\
        \ and reciprocating our little store of comforts and luxuries, I felt half\
        \ loath to leave them and to launch again upon the burning waste. Thus it\
        \ is with the traveller ; no sooner does he begin to grow to anything, than\
        \ he is rudely torn from it ; he no sooner begins to love, than he must hasten\
        \ to forget ; and few are the friendships that outlive the feverish hurry\

        \ the minimum of what is usually given, as an offering for the hospitable\
        \ shelter of the con vent. With a supply of bread for some davs we had already\

        \ convent was unnoticed, this could not be said of our departure, for it was\
        \ graced by a tumult and uproar which might have awakened the dead. Immediately\
        \ on first reaching it, Umbarak and his Arabs had, as I have already said,\

        \ they were to reassemble in a few days. Knowing that they had arrived, I\

        \ which seem threatening to bury it, and furiously rattles an old casement\
        \ or two ; then aU is still again. An old irregular wall, patched in different\
        \ ages, with here and there a tower, fences in and looks down upon the entire\
        \ maze of buildings : within are courts, and corridors, and galleries, connected\
        \ by blind passages, and flights of steps, mostly invisible from above. Every\
        \ now and then a dark-robed figure will suddenly peep out, like a mouse, from\
        \ one hole then burrow into another, and disappear. But for this, one would\
        \ never suspect the little busy world hidden beneath, \u2014 the snug storehouses\
        \ of corn, wine, and wood ; the monastic makers of bread, distillers of raki,\
        \ tailors, blacksmiths, shoemakers, and cook, all busy, like ants, under ground\
        \ ; the only genteel sinecurist being the Librarian, for if the body is but\
        \ poorly provided for within these holy walls, the mind is starved outright.\
        \ The church is wedged incomprehensibly into this labyrinth, presenting, as\
        \ viewed from above, only a sharp gabled roof, well leaded, with a cross at\

        \ monks were compelled to admit a mosque for Mussulman pilgrims. Such is the\
        \ interior of the convent, viewed from above ; and I was poring over its singular\
        \ ap pearance, when Pietro joined me, and offered his services as cicerone.\
        \ I was curious first to go round the wall, and, following my compa nion,\

        gloom of the little paved courts ; and vines were occasionally trained about
        the walls, or upon a rude trellis. Here and there a sleek, indulged, well-con
        ditioned cat, sat gravely perched upon a familiar stone. Mounting a flight
        of steps, we paid a short visit to the Superior, whose room looks down into
        the principal court : it was neatly whitewashed, and furnished with a divan,
        but entirely destitute of ornament. Though in appearance naturally grave and
        reserved, he was evidently kind hearted ; and in the most hospitable manner
        produced his little store of choice fruit, which he peeled himself, and presented,
        au attendant handing liqueur. I found it had been a trying season for the
        con vent, a severe rain-storm had carried away portions of the garden walls,
        and a terrible aud most destructive flight of locusts had swept all the conventual
        gardens, both here and at Tor ; while the new buildings had occasioned an
        outlay, which, however, was principally met, as I understood, out of the funds
        at the disposal of the Greek archbishop. AU this, as I was privately informed
        by Pietro, weighed much upon the spirits of the worthy Superior. Descending
        the steps, accompanied by him, into the little court, we saw the Ikonomos
        and Librarian seated on a bench in front of the humble apartment of the latter
        functionary. They rose to salute us ; the Ikonomos, upon whom, as, I need
        hardly say, his appel lation implies, devolves the immediate charge of aU
        the temporal arrangements of the convent, besides the business of communicating
        with the Arabs, was a fine-looking old Greek, with mingled keen ness and prudence
        expressed in his marked countenance, the effect of which was heightened by
        a long white beard. The Librarian was decidedly the gentleman of the convent
        ; his manners were bland, and his courtesy as frank and sincere as it was
        refined ; and he had evidently a desire to obtain information from the world
        beyond. With the assistance of Pietro, and of a few words of Italian which
        the Librarian had picked up, we contrived to establish a sort of conversation
        ; and, evidently to their satisfaction, I invited myself to their religious
        service and succeeding repast on the follow ing morning.', 3]

        \ in the eye of history, are the true Peers and Paladins of French chivalry.\
        \ After a bloody field, in which Abderame was slain, the Saracens, in the\
        \ close of the evening, retired to their camp. In the disorder and despair\
        \ of the night the various tribes of Yemen and Damascus, of Africa and Spain,\
        \ were provoked to turn their arms against each other : the remains of their\
        \ host were suddenly dissolved, and each emir consulted his safety by an hasty\
        \ and separate retreat. At the dawn of day the stillness of an hostile camp\
        \ was suspected by the victorious Christians : on the report of their spies\
        \ they ventured to explore the riches of the vacant tents ; but if we except\
        \ some cele brated relics, a small portion of the spoil was restored to the\
        \ innocent and lawful owners. The joyful tidings were soon diffused over the\
        \ Catholic world, and the monks of Italy could affirm and believe that three\
        \ hundred and fifty, or three hundred and seventy-five, thousand of the Mahometans\
        \ had been crushed by the hammer of Charles,32 while no more than fifteen\
        \ hundred Christians were slain in the field of Tours. But this incredible\
        \ tale is sufficiently disproved by the caution of the French general, who\
        \ apprehended the snares and acci- dents of a pursuit, and dismissed his German\
        \ allies to their native forests. The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the\
        \ loss of strength and blood, and the most cruel execution is inflicted, not\
        \ in the ranks of battle, but on the backs of a flying enemy. Yet the victory\
        \ of the Franks was complete and final ; Aquitain was recovered by the arms\
        \ of Eudes ; the Arabs never resumed the conquest before the of Gaul,\" and\
        \ they were soon driven beyond the Pyrenees by Charles Martel and his valiant\

        \ serious warfare, where we found him in the army of Bompeius as com mandant\

        \ was destined by his conqueror to be librarian of the library which was to\
        \ be formed in the capital. The troubles of the following period drew the\
        \ old man once more into their vortex, and it was not till seven teen years\
        \ after C\xE6sar's death, in the eighty-ninth year of his well-occupied life,\
        \ that death called him away. The \xE6sthetic writings, which have made him\
        \ a name, were brief essays, some in simple prose and of graver contents,\
        \ others humorous sketches the prose groundwork of which was inlaid with various\
        \ poetical effusions. The former were the \"philosophico-historical dissertations\"\
        \ (Logistorici), the latter the Menippean Satires. In neither case did he\
        \ follow Latin models, and the Satura of Varro in particular was by no means\
        \ based on that of Lucilius. In fact the Boman Satura in general was not properly\
        \ a fixed species of art, but onlv indicated negatively the fact that the\
        \ \" multifarious poem\" was not to be included under any of the recognised\
        \ forms of art; and accordingly the Sntura-poetry assumed in the hands of\
        \ every gifted poet a different and peculiar character. It was rather in the\
        \ pre- Alexandrian Greek poetry that Varro found the models for his more severe\
        \ as well as for his lighter \xE6sthetic works ; for the graver dissertations,\
        \ in the dialogues of Heraclides ofHeraclea on the Black Sea (-(-about 450),\
        \ for the satires, in the writings of Menippus of Gadara in Syria (flourishing\
        \ about 175). The choice was significant. Hera clides, stimulated as an author\
        \ by Plato's philosophic dia logues, had amidst the brilliance of their form\
        \ totally lost sight of the scientific contents and made the poetico fabulistic\
        \ dress the main matter ; he was an agreeable and largely-read author, but\
        \ far from a philosopher. Menippus was quite as little a philosopher, but\
        \ the most genuine literary representative of that philosophy whose wisdom\

        \ ment. While the Roman senate had first combated and then at the most had\
        \ simply tolerated culture, the government of the new Italo-Hellenic empire,\
        \ whose essential character in fact was humanitas, could not but adopt measures\
        \ to stim ulate it after the Hellenic fashion. If C\xE6sar conferred the Roman\
        \ franchise on all teachers of the liberal sciences and all the physicians\
        \ of the capital, we may discover in this step a paving of the way in some\
        \ degree for those institutions in which subsequently the higher bilingual\
        \ culture of the youth of the empire was provided for on the part of the state,\
        \ and which form the most significant expression of the new state of humanitas\
        \ ; and if C\xE6sar had further resolved on the esta blishment of a public\
        \ Greek and Latin library in the capital and had already nominated the most\
        \ learned Roman of the age, Marcus Varro, as principal librarian, this implied\
        \ un mistakeably the design of opening up the cosmopolitan monarchy to cosmopolitan\
        \ literature. The development of the language during this period turned on\
        \ the distinction between the classical Latin of cultivated society and the\
        \ vulgar language of common life. The former itself was a product of the distinctively\
        \ Italian culture ; even in the Scipionic circle \" pure Latin \" had become\
        \ the cue, and the mother tongue was spoken, no longer in entire naivete,\
        \ but in conscious contradistinction to the language of the great multitude.\
        \ This epoch opens with a remarkable reaction against the classicism which\
        \ had hitherto exclusively prevailed in the higher language of conversation\
        \ and accord ingly also in literature \u2014 a reaction which had inwardly\
        \ and outwardly a close connection with the reaction of a similar kind in\
        \ Greece. Just about this time the rhetor and romance writer Hegesias of Magnesia\
        \ and the numerous rhetors and literati of Asia Minor who attached themselves\
        \ to him began to rebel agiinst the orthodox Atticism. They de manded full\

        \ or the phrase originated in Attica or in Caria and Phrygia ; they themselves\
        \ spoke and wrote not for the taste of learned cliques, but for that of the\
        \ great public. There could be no reasonable dispute as to the principle ;\
        \ but certainly the result could not be better than was the public of Asia\

        \ He soon discovered his error, and bewailed the irreparable loss. While Sigismond\
        \ embraced the corpse of the unfortunate youth, he received a severe admonition\
        \ from one of his attendants : \" It is not \" his situation, O king ! it\
        \ is thine which deserves pity and lamenta \" tion.\" The reproaches of a\
        \ guilty conscience were alleviated, however, by his liberal donations to\
        \ the monastery of Agaunum, or St. Maurice, in Vallais ; which he himself\
        \ had founded in honour of the imaginary martyrs of the Theb\xE6an legion.44\
        \ A full chorus of perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious king ; he\
        \ assiduously practised the austere devotion of the monks ; and it was his\
        \ humble prayer that Heaven would inflict in this world the punishment of\
        \ his sins. His prayer was heard : the avengers were at hand ; and the provinces\
        \ of Burgundy were overwhelmed by an army of victorious Franks. After the\
        \ event of an unsuccessful battle, Sigismond, who wished to protract his life\
        \ that he might prolong his penance, con cealed himself in the desert in a\
        \ religious habit till he was discovered and betrayed by his subjects, who\
        \ solicited the favour of their new masters. The captive monarch, with his\

        \ cyclic Iliad and Odyssey were the same in the main (allowing for corrections\

        accorded to strangers of perusing its contents. Hence, to one sitting with
        some thirty or forty borrowed tomes before him, that of Stockholm seems the
        first in Europe. A catalogue of manuscripts don''t enter within my limits;

        seemed doubtful, had sat still awaiting his decision. Now that it was given,

        habits had borne him to every quarter of the globe, stopped with weary gait
        and dusty shoes at the Charity''s gates, and that if the bishop''s bounty
        had done no more than give Philip Western a resting-place, which for want
        of a better he could call a home, it would not have been without some claims
        upon the gratitude of scholars. Miss Pidgrief s notion of full dress consisted
        of a counterpart of the cap and curls, a trifle fresher and less decayed,
        a suit of pure white frdls and codar, and a somewhat less rusty black silk
        dress. Having donned these and left word with her bttle maid where she was
        to be found if No. 9 should be taken dl again, and that there was some cold
        bread-and-butter pudding in the closet for Master Louis, when he should come
        home, Miss Pidgrief threw a shawl over her head, tucked up the skirts of her
        dress deftly, and made a run through the snow for the librarian''s staircase.
        That shelter gained, the matron paused to re cover her breath and arrange
        the disordered dress and curls. She halted again hesitatingly at the top of
        the stairs, with her hand upon Philip Western''s door. Familiar as Miss Pidgrief

        does not seem to have really liked Geneva, which may account for his refusal
        of office. Having obtained the protection of Frederick the Great, who may
        have been said to have formed a rallying point for philosophers and men of
        letters of Eousseau''s school, he retired to the Canton of Neuchatel, where
        he was enabled to pursue his literary and philosophical labours unmolested.
        The governor of the Canton, who ruled for the King of Prussia, was the famous
        Earl Marshal of Scotland, brother to the gallant Marshall Keith, who lost
        his life in Frederick''s service at the battle of Hochkirchen in 1758. His
        esteem for Eousseau was so great that he used to call him his son, whilst
        the respect of the latter for the Scottish statesman was such that he always
        considered Keith as his father. The Earl Marshal, one of Frederick''s most
        intimate friends, had been obliged to quit Scotland on account of the share
        which he took in the rebellion of 1745, and entered the service of the King
        of Prussia, who at once appointed him governor of the Canton of Neuchatel
        ; in the administration of which, as well as by his diplomatic sagacity at
        Madrid, he distin guished himself as the representative of Prussia. He was
        the first person who had any suspicion of the existence of the family compact
        between the courts of France and Spain, and he communicated this information
        to Mr. Pitt, afterwards Earl of Chatham, for which ser vice he obtained a
        pardon from the British Crown, and resided for some time in Scotland, from
        which country he was at length recalled to his foreign post by the earnest
        solicitations of Frederick II. He died at the great age of 82, with all his
        faculties in full vigour. Eousseau enjoyed the friendship of this able man
        during his quiet retreat at Neuchatel, where, it appears, Jean Jacques carried
        on a large correspondence with many of the crowned heads of Europe, their
        chief statesmen, and with the most eminent ecclesiastics and scholars of both
        Eoman Catholic and Protestant creeds. The numerous letters which he there
        wrote are preserved in the library at Neufchatel, and have been carefully
        arranged by the different librarians to whom the charge of that institution
        has been committed. These documents have formed the basis upon which the book
        before us has been compiled. Although we cannot agree in all that has been
        put forward in Eousseau''s behalf by his able biographer, we cannot but highly
        praise the research and care with which Mons. Gaberel has arranged his little
        volume, and selected the most strik ing correspondence in order to throw light
        on his subject. During his retirement, Eousseau varied his occupations by
        visiting the French capital, by composing his two great works, "Le Contrat
        Social," and "l''Emile." The former contained his political opinions, and
        the latter his religious ideas; though some', 1]

        merciful to his hereti cal subjects, wisely abstaining from meddling with
        their commercial pursuits any further than by taking their vessels as lawful
        prizes of war. The only parallel that can be found to the treatment of the
        French Huguenots, is that of Philip III of Spain, towards his Mahomedan and
        Jewish subjects. Both were equally impolitic, and both deprived their dominions
        of many useful and industrious inhabitants. This policy is not to be wondered
        at in the bigoted Philip III, who was originally intended for the priestly
        office ; but it is surprising in the able and politic French monarch, whose
        cruelty towards the un fortunate Protestants we could scarcely believe, were

        by a state correspondence of Colbert, the Chancellor, the Secretary of State,
        and the Marquis de Seignelay, &c. &c. during the years ''81, ''82, ''83, and
        in the written order for the destruction of Protestant temples, the prevention
        of removal of Protestant children from certain neighbourhoods in order that
        they might be sent to Eoman Catholic schools ; the deprivation of Protestants
        of all share in judicature ; and the prohibition to leave the country under
        any pretence. All efforts to assist the poor and sick amongst the Pro testants
        were strictly forbidden ; and all societies for that purpose were to be put
        down by the strong hand of the police. All efforts to convert the Catholics
        to Protestanism were strongly opposed by the Government; and a certain surgeon,
        who repaired to some baths on the Swiss frontier, and who was supposed to
        combine conversion with the cure of the sick, received peremptory orders from
        the Government to confine himself to the duties of his profession. All books
        also were prohibited to be published which propagated the doctrines of the
        reformed religion ; and a librarian at Paris was informed by Colbert that
        although his Majesty had no objection to his continuing the sale of his works,
        he desired to put a stop to the distribution of Protestant publications. The
        authorities in certain districts of the south of France were likewise informed
        that those farmers on the King''s land, who obstinately refused to be converted
        to the Eoman Catholic faith, were to be deprived of their lands, and replaced
        by the men of the orthodox religion. The same measures were also to be adopted
        with regard to Protestant communes, which were being depopulated of their
        present inhabitants, and were to be filled by Catholics. Orders were also
        issued that Catho lic instead of Protestant workmen should be employed in
        repairing the various churches throughout the- kingdom, a labour which had
        formerly been equally enjoyed by men of both religions. The only privilege
        which seems to have been accorded to the Protestants, was one of which they

        \ Germain, the principal adviser of Marie de Medici, the Queen Mother and\
        \ former Eegent of France, with whom he was then residing at Brussels. This\
        \ attack was at once replied to by the Academy, although it did not feel itself\
        \ bound to encounter all assailants ; its members wisely considering that\
        \ truth, together with public opinion, could alone give the association its\
        \ proper influence. A very amusing comedy* was published, ridiculing the Academy\
        \ and its individual members. The author of the play was, however, never discovered,\
        \ though it was attributed by many to the brother of Halle, the Archbishop\
        \ of Paris. Following out the history of Mons. Olivet, we are told of some\
        \ of the early regulations of the Academy, and find that its laws were at\
        \ first few in number, and simple in character. As the society became more\
        \ permanently established, it was found necessary to amplify these rules.\
        \ A director, chancellor, and secretary, were elected by ballot ; the two\
        \ former officers holding their posts for two months, but eligible for re-election.\
        \ Their duties were to preside over the meetings of the Academy, to see that\
        \ its objects were properly carried out, and receive new members on election.\
        \ Besides the secretary, whose duties were similar to those of any other association,\
        \ a librarian took charge of the library, and superintended the publication\
        \ of the works of the Academy. Mons. Boisrobert and Desmarest were the first\

        \ the Academy effected in the way of improving and refining the literature\
        \ and language of France. Several of the council were appointed, at particular\
        \ periods, to deliver discourses on various subjects, such as history, philosophy,\
        \ and the Latin and Greek literature. Many of the members agreed to refine\
        \ the language, by means of a dictionary and grammar, and set to work to correct\

        They were much assisted by the judgment of the Cardinal himself, who, with
        refined taste, encouraged, by his liberality, many of the writers of the day
        to compose poems and plays, the representation of which took place in a large
        hall built adjoining his palace, which served both as a theatre and an assembly
        room. By such means the impurities and errors of the language were made apparent
        and corrected, and expressions, the propriety of which were often dis cussed
        at Court, were referred by the Cardinal to his savans of the Academy. Thus
        much was done, even in the early days of the Academy, to purify the French
        language and style, and great progress was made in the advancement of literature.
        The death of the first librarian, who was much esteemed and lamented by the
        Academicians, and for whose family they petitioned his Eminence, was followed
        by that of the Cardinal himself, who had for so long protected the association.
        It was determined that his merits should be publicly proclaimed, and that
        an oration should be delivered on his virtues by the principal members in
        full seance ; that the Academy should attend his funeral in procession, and
        wear mourning as for a departed brother in science. After all these com plimentary
        measures were fully carried out, the Academy had the difficult task of selecting
        a new Protector. Two candidates offered themselves ; viz. the Cardinal de
        Mazarin, who had not as yet made himself unpopular by mixing with the factions
        which afterwards disturbed France, and who was most likely to obtain equal
        influence in the state as his former colleague the Cardinal de Eichelieu.
        The other candidate was the Duke D''Enghein, afterwards well known as the
        great Conde. Although very young, he had already become a celebrity as a wit
        and a patron of literature, and had taken an interest in the affairs of the
        Academy from its very beginning in 1635, and had then been elected one of
        its members. The body had at first desired to place itself under his protection,
        as being a Eoyal Prince, but it feared the all-powerful Cardinal. Neither
        were how ever appointed President ; as the post was filled by M. Chancelier,
        a very old and deserving Academician. We have a long list of the original
        members of the Academy, an epitome of their lives, and a catalogue of illustrious
        persons, down to Louis XIV, who encouraged literature and science ; also the
        foreign princes who patronized the Academy, amongst whom the celebrated Swedish
        Queen Christina was the earliest. She not only favoured it by presenting her
        portrait, but attended a seance in person. Her presence was so unexpected,
        that half of the members were absent, and the rest totally unprepared.', 1]

        his work before the public without at once recording his obligations to the
        kindness of several friends. His grateful acknowledgments are due to the Rector
        and Fellows of Exeter College for the free use of their valuable library ;
        to Dr. Bandinel, librarian of the Bodleian, and the Rev. H. 0. Coxe, sub-librarian
        of the same, for much attention and courtesy ; to Professor Lassen of Bonn,
        for kind directions as to German sources of illustration ; to Dr. Scott, Master
        of Balliol, for assistance on difficult points of scholarship ; and to Professor
        Max Miiller, of this University, for many useful hints upon subjects connected
        with ethnology and comparative philology. Chiefly, however, he has to thank
        his two colleagues, Sir Henry Rawlinson and Sir Gardner Wilkinson, for their
        in valuable assistance. The share which these writers have taken in the work
        is very insufficiently represented by the attachment of their initials to
        the notes and essays actually contributed by them. Sir Henry Rawlinson especially
        has exercised a general supervision over the Oriental portion of the comment
        ; and although he is, of course, not to be regarded as responsible for any
        statements but those to which his initials are affixed, he has in fact lent
        his aid throughout in all that concerns the geography, ethnography, and history
        of the Eastern nations. It was the promise of this assistance which alone
        emboldened the Editor to undertake a work of such pretension as the full illustration
        from the best sources, ancient and modern, of so discursive a writer as Herodotus.
        It will be, he feels, the advantage derived from the free bestowal of the
        assistance which will lend to the work itself its principal and most permanent
        interest. Oxford, January 1st, 1858.', 1]

        been a flourishing in stitution when people came for the Spectator, and wanted
        Miss Burney''s last novel ; but the world had gone on and left it in the background.
        It was known that no book published within the century could be found on its
        shelves, and it took in no periodical but the " Gentle man''s Magazine." Its
        subscribers had consequently not increased. The assistant librarian had almost
        as little to do as he could wish. Mr. Alston''s nerves had re covered from
        the shock they met with in Piccadilly, and he was musing either on the " lovely
        Jemima," or what he should have for supper, as he sat at his post one particularly
        slack evening in the same week, when in walked the maid who had bundled him
        into the closet, sent Mr. Leslie up to find him there, and made merry over
        his fetching down-stairs. " Good evening, Mr. Alston," said Sarah Ann, with
        out the slightest hesitation. Then looking cautiously round, and dropping

        \ pointed nose was perked still higher. \"Miss Leslie couldn't do without\
        \ me. But ladies will have their tempers. The master's send ing her out of\
        \ town all on your account, sir ; and we're going to live at 'ampstead. I\

        \ seems to have been unmindful of the tenderness of her sex and the generosity\

    - ['172 BIGGAR AND THE HOUSE OF FLEMING. Biggar. He had read aU the books in the
        Hbrary, and many of them several times over. As he was endowed with a most
        tenacious memory, he could give a summary of the contents of any one of them
        to which his attention might be directed, as weU as a very correct estimate
        of its merits. His conversational powers were of a high order. It was a treat
        of no ordinary kind to sit beside him while en gaged with his elshin and his
        lingle, and hear him discourse with fluency and critical acumen on poetry,
        philosophy, politics, rehgion, and general literature. He was a notable specimen
        of not a few men living in obscure corners of our country, and pursuing an
        humble vocation, who have, nevertheless, entered into the very depths of the
        great masters of literature, and have had a powerful influence in stimulating
        and moulding the minds of the generation around them. The present librarian
        is Mr James SmaU, shoemaker. The EvangeHcal Library was founded in 1807, and,
        as its title im ports, it is composed of books of a religious cast. It contains
        900 volumes. The entry money and annual payment are 2s. each. This Hbrary
        is scarcely in so flourishing a state as could be desired. Biggar Kirk Library
        contains upwards of 1100 volumes, and is supported by collections at evening
        sermons, delivered under the auspices of the Established Church. The Biggar
        ReHef Juvenile Library has a very useful collection of books, amounting to
        nearly 700 volumes; and is conducted by7 a committee of the congregation.
        The entry money is 6d., and the annual payment Is. Id. The existence of these
        Ubraries bears abundant testimony to the reading habits of the inhabitants,
        and the desire generally felt to spend their leisure hours in rational and
        profitable exercises. It is very desirable, however, that a movement should
        be set on foot to unite the most of these libraries into one institution.
        AVere this done, and a suitable apartment budt for their accommodation, and
        a fair remuneration given to a person to take charge of them, not only w7ould
        the books be preserved from the risk of being dispersed, but an addi tional
        impetus would be given to that mental cultivation and rational amusement which
        are to be derived from the perusal of good books. One of the branches of education
        long sedulously cultivated at Biggar is that of music, both vocal and instrumental.
        An excellence in this department is one of the things in which the inhabitants
        have taken great pride. No town of so small a size has sent forth so many
        reaUy good singers ; and none has had a succession of better instrumental
        performers. So far back as 1513, mention is made of the piper and fiddler
        of Biggar, who played to James IV. on one of his visits to the town. AVhen
        the CoUegiate Kirk of Biggar was erected, one of its prebendaries was appointed
        to play the organ and to teach music, both to the singing-boys of the Kirk,
        and to the parishioners at large. After the Reformation, the parish schoolmaster
        was generally the pre centor in the church, and, no doubt, the teacher of
        psalmody. When', 1]

        \ to view in the earliest specimens which the Greek Anthology contains. For\
        \ this Anthology we are indebted to Meleager, the Syrian, who flourished about\
        \ a century before the Christian era, and who was the first collector of epigrams.\
        \ He gathered into a garland the scattered fragments, which, engraved on marble\
        \ or dis persed abroad as fugitive pieces, were in danger of being irretrievably\
        \ lost. This garland, or Anthology, received subsequent additions, and at\
        \ a later period sustained severe loss through the decay of manuscripts, and\
        \ the indifference of librarians in an ignorant age. But a noble store of\
        \ Greek epigrams is still extant, gathered together in the \" Anthologia\"\
        \ of Jacobs, 1794-1814, where a collection of these beautiful pieces is presented,\
        \ which have defied the ravages of time, and are preserved as models of simplicity\
        \ of thought and elegance of language. A few examples from the earlier Greek\
        \ authors will show the simplicity, and display the character, of the epi\
        \ grams. The first is an inscription by Simonides, which serves the double\
        \ purpose of commemorating the deeds of the dead, and of impressing on the\

        \ the culture of potatoes into this island. ' ' Perhaps the thing of most\
        \ importance in the education of the common people, is to prevent the intrusion\
        \ of artificial wants. I bless the memory of my worthy father for almost everything\
        \ in the dis positions of my mind, and my habits of life, which I can approve\
        \ of ; and for none more than the pains he took to impress my mind with the\
        \ sentiment, that nothing was more unworthy the character of a man than that\
        \ his happiness should in the least depend on what he should eat or drink\
        \ So early did he impress my mind with this, that although I was as fond of\
        \ sweetmeats as children generally are, yet I seldom laid out any of the halfpence,\
        \ which relations or neighbours gave me at fairs, in the purchase of them\
        \ ; and if I did, every mouthful I swallowed was accom fjanied with shame\
        \ and remorse ; and to this hour I never indulge in the use of any delicacy,\
        \ but I feel a considerable degree of self-reproach and alarm for the degradation\
        \ of the human character. Such a habit of thinking I consider as of great\
        \ consequence, both to the virtue and happiness of men in the lower ranks\
        \ of life. And thus, Sir, I am of opinion, that if their minds are early and\
        \ deeply impressed with a sense of the dignity of man, as such \u2014 with\
        \ the love of independence and of industry, economy, and tem perance, as the\
        \ most obvious means of making them selves independent, and the virtues most\

        \ the lower ranks of life may partake of the pleasures to be derived from\
        \ the perusal of books calculated to improve the mind and refine the taste,\
        \ without any danger of becoming more unhappy in their situation or discontented\

        \ There are some hours every day that the most constant labourer is neither\
        \ at work nor asleep. These hours are either appropriated to amusement or\
        \ to sloth. If a taste for employing these hour3 in reading were cultivated\
        \ I do Dot suppose that the return to labour would be more difficult. Every\
        \ one will allow that the attachment to idle amusements, or even to sloth,\
        \ has as powerful a tendency to abstract men from their proper business as\
        \ the attach ment to books ; while the one dissipates the mind, the other\
        \ tends to increase its powers of self, government. To those who are afraid\
        \ that the im provement of the minds of the common people might be dangerous\
        \ to the state, or the established order of society, I would remark, that\
        \ turbulence and com motion are certainly very inimical to the feelings of\
        \ a refined mind Let the matter be brought to the test of experience and observation.\
        \ Of what descrip tion of people are mobs and insurrections composed? Are\
        \ they not universally owing to the want of enlargement and improvement of\
        \ mind among the common people? Nay, let any one recollect the characters\
        \ of those who formed the calmer and more deliberate associations which lately\
        \ gave so much alarm to the government of this country. I suppose few of the\
        \ common people who were to be found in such societies had the education and\
        \ turn of mind I have been endeavouring to recommend Allow me to suggest one\
        \ reason for endeavouring to enlighten the minds of the common people. Their\
        \ morals have hitherto been guarded by a sort of dim religious awe, which\
        \ from a variety of causes seems wearing off. I think the alteration in this\
        \ respect considerable, in the short period of my observation. I have already\
        \ given my opinion of the effects of refinement on morals and virtue. Whenever\
        \ vulgar minds begin to shake off the dogmas of the religion in which they\
        \ have been educated, the progress is quick and immediate to downright infidelity\
        \ ; and nothing but refinement of mind can enable them to distinguish between\
        \ the pure essence of religion and the gross systems which men have been perpetually\
        \ connecting it with. \"In addition to what has already been done for the\
        \ education of the common people of this country, in the establishment of\
        \ parish schools, I wish to see the salaries augmented in some proportion\
        \ to the present expense of living, and the earnings of people of similar\
        \ rank, endowments, and usefulness in society; and I hope that the liberality\
        \ of the present age will be no longer disgraced by refusing, to so useful\
        \ a class of men, such encouragement as may make parish schools worth the\
        \ attention of men fitted for the important duties of that office. In filling\

        \ and the love of his king and his country \u2014 than to his proficiency\
        \ in the knowledge of Latin and Greek. I would then have a sort of high English\
        \ class established not only for the purpose of teaching the pupils to read\
        \ in that graceful and agreeable manner that might make them fond of reading,\
        \ but to make them understand what they read and dis cover the beauties of\
        \ the author, in composition and sentiment. I would have established in every\
        \ parish a small circulating library, consisting of the books which the young\
        \ people had read extracts from in the collections they had read at school,\
        \ and any other books well calculated to refine the mind im prove the moral\
        \ feelings, recommend the practice of virtue, and communicate such knowledge\
        \ as might be useful and suitable to the labouring classes of men. I would\
        \ have the schoolmaster act as librarian ; and, in recommending books to his\
        \ young friends, formerly his pupils, and letting in the fight of them upon\
        \ their young minds, he should have the assistance of the minister. If once\
        \ such education were become gen eral, the low delights of the publichouse,\
        \ and other scenes of riot and depravity, would be contemned and neglected\
        \ ; while industry, order, cleanliness, and every virtue which taste and independence\
        \ of mind could recommend would prevail and flourish. Thus possessed of a\

        \ rendered easy of arrangement; and procuring an appointment to the Dumfries\

        \ None of these tragic memoranda were derived from imagination. Nor was Tam\
        \ o' Shanter himself an imaginary character. Shanter is a farm close to Kirk-Oswald,\
        \ that smuggling village in which Burns, when nineteen years old, studied\
        \ mensuration, aud \" first became acquainted with scenes of swaggering riot.\"\
        \ The then occupier of Shanter, by name Doug las Grabame, was, by all accounts,\
        \ equally what the Tam of the poet appears, \u2014 a jolly, careless rustic,\
        \ who took much more interest in the contraband traffic of the coast than\
        \ the rotation of crops. Burns knew the man well ; and to his dying day, he,\
        \ nothing loath, passed among his rural compeers by the name of \" Tam o'\
        \ Shanter.\" * He left Elliesland, however, with a heavy heart. The affection\
        \ of his neighbours was rekindled in all its early fervour by the thoughts\
        \ of parting with him; and the roup of his farming stock and other effects\
        \ was, in spite of whisky, a very melancholy scene. The competition for his\
        \ chattels (says Allan Cun ningham) was eager, each being anxious to secure\
        \ a memorandum of Burns's residence among them. A few words will bring us\
        \ to the close of Burns's career at Elliesland. Mr. Ramsay of Ochtertyre,\
        \ happening to pass through Niths dale in 1790, met Burns riding rapidly near\
        \ Closeburn. The poet was obliged to pursue his professional journey, but\
        \ sent on Mr. Ram say and his fellow-traveller to Elliesland, where he joined\
        \ them as soon as his duty permitted him, saying, as he entered, \"I come,\
        \ to use the words of Shakespeare, 'stewed in haste.'\" Mr. Ramsay was \"\
        \ much pleased with his uxor Sabina qualis, and his modest mansion, so unlike\
        \ the habitation of ordinary rustics.\" He told his guests he was preparing\
        \ to write a drama, which he was to call \" 'Rob M'Quechan's Elshin,' from\
        \ a popular story of King Robert the Bruce being defeated on the Carron, when\
        \ the heel of his boot having loosened in the flight, he applied to one Robert\
        \ M'Quechan to fix it ; who, to make sure, ran his awl nine inches up the\
        \ king's heel.\" The evening was spent delightfully. A gentleman of dry tem\
        \ perament, who looked in accidentally, soon partook the contagion, and sat\
        \ listening to Burns with the tears running over his cheeks. \"Poor Burns!\"\
        \ says Mr. Ramsay, \"from that time I met him no more.\" It is pleasing to\
        \ know that, among other \" titles manifold\" to their respect aud gratitude,\
        \ Burns, at the suggestion of Mr. Riddel of Friars' Carse, had superintended\
        \ the formation of a subscription library in the parish. His letters to the\
        \ booksellers on this subject do him much honour, his choice of authors (which\

        \ judicious. Such institutions are now common, almost universal, indeed, in\
        \ the rural districts of southern Scotland; but it should never be forgotten\
        \ that Burns was among the first, if not the very first, to set the example.\

        seldom shown to strangers, the large '' Flag of the Holy Inquisition,'' which
        was uncovered with peculiar care, and unfolded and spread on the table for
        my inspection : it is about twelve feet in length and eight in breadth, and
        is composed of crimson silk of great richness and thick ness, and in the centre
        the arms of the Inquisition are worked in gold, surrounded with the very expressive
        motto '' Exsurge, Domine, causam Tuam judica.'' This was evi dently regarded
        with great reverence as a memento of days when the Church was all-powerful,

        that banner bad witnessed many a cruel death, and had floated over the procession
        at many an auto de fe, but amidst the enormities of which the Holy Inquisition
        was undoubtedly guilty, it was the cause of one glorious effect, which remains
        to this day, that dissenters from the Church have never gained a footing in
        either Spain or Portugal; so that, while I could scarcely repress a shudder
        as I thought of the fearful tortures and the wretched vic tims of which it

        from which we at home are apparently so distant ; but which, if only it could
        be attained, would be the greatest blessing religion in England could know.
        There is, moreover, this to be said with regard to the Inquisition in the
        Peninsula, that though nothing can excuse or palliate the injustice, the guilt,
        the cruelties, and the judicial murders it caused, and the monstrous abuses
        to which it gave rise, its original intention, however ill founded and unlikely

        \ was absent from Evora, but I found two sub-librarians, busily employed in\
        \ making a catalogue of the books ; and as they most kindly left their occupation\
        \ and conducted me round the library, pointing out every thing worthy of notice,\
        \ and bringing out all the treasures one by one for my examination \u2014\
        \ as, moreover, one of them possessed some knowledge of French, I had no cause\
        \ to regret the absence of the chief librarian ; and certainly nothing could\
        \ be more courteous and civil than my two attendants, who grudged neither\
        \ time nor trouble in my behalf, but for above an hour devoted themselves\
        \ to gra tifying my curiosity by exhibiting the valuables they had in charge.\
        \ The pictures, of which there is a large collec tion, are, with very few\
        \ exceptions, but wretched daubs, and though many have been attributed to\
        \ the Portuguese painter of chief renown, I might almost say the only Por\

        \ they laughingly added that every picture in Portugal was generally attributed\
        \ to Gran Vasco, though in reality very few of his paintings exist. One treasure\

        \ of saints and of monks of every order and in every habit ; and all of true\

        her to the rest of her relations as well as the other guests who were staying
        in the house. But Mistress Dorothy was far too strict in her regulations as
        to meals to allow herself to eat at this time in the afternoon. She would,
        if he would allow her, present herself to his company, ancl would then retire
        to her own room to rest a little before dinner, which she presumed would be
        at four or half after. ''My dear aunt,'' said the Squire, looking uncomfortably
        em barrassed, as though a subject was approaching which would lose him her
        favour, '' our dinner here is not until half-past five, and I must insist
        on your having at least a glass of wine or a cup of hot coffee at once, or
        else you will be quite exhausted. But let me introduce you first to my guests,
        who are all assembled to greet you in the library.'' Mrs. Dorothy Savile,
        on another occasion, would not have let slip such an opportunity for various
        diatribes on the degeneracy of the times, in which dinner has to be put off
        until the evening, but she contented herself with mildly observing, '' So,
        John, you too change with the times, and are become fashionable,'' and suffered
        herself to be led into the handsome library, which would now have been famed
        for its carved oak bookcases and panelling, but which was in these degenerate
        times covered over and concealed by the thick coatings of peach-coloured paint
        which one of the later Saviles had added. The Savile library was, however,
        a possession handed down with just pride from father to son, and gradually
        increased until it had become valuable in the extreme. Though the present
        Squire cared nothing for the books themselves, and never with but few exceptions
        looked into them, he was proud ofthe renown his library had attained, and
        had, through his late cousin Sir George Savile''s advice, added to it the
        modern literature of the day. Since his death he had placed over it a custodian
        and librarian, a distant cousin of the Saviles, and a great friend of his
        own, as well as the family physician, and who was descended in a direct line
        from the famous Sir Henry Savile, the founder of the Savilian Professorships

        \ hatchets to Paris and showed them to several members of the Institute. MM.\
        \ Alexandre Brongniart, Flourens, Elie de Beaumont, Cordier, and Jomard, gave\
        \ at first some encouragement to researches which promised to be so fruitful\
        \ in results ; but this favourable feeling was not destined to last long.\
        \ These rough specimens of wrought flint, in which Boucher de Perthes already\
        \ recognised a kind of hatchet, presented very indistinct traces of chipping,\
        \ and the angles were blunted ; their flattened shape, too, differed from\
        \ that of the polished hatchets, the only kind that were then known. It was\
        \ certainly necessary to see with the eyes of faith in order to discern the\
        \ traces of man's work. \" I,\" says the Abbeville arch\xE6ologist, \" had\
        \ these ' eyes of faith,' but no one shared them with me.\" He then made up\
        \ his mind to seek for help in his labour, and trained workmen to dig in the\
        \ diluvial beds. Before long he was able to collect, in the quarternary beds\
        \ at Abbeville, twenty specimens of flint evidently wrought by the hand of\
        \ man. In 1842, the Geological Society of London received a communication\
        \ from Mr. Godwin Austen, who had found in Kent's Hole various wrought objects,\
        \ accompanied by animal remains, which must have remained there since the\
        \ deluge.\" In 1844, appeared Lund's observations on the caverns of Brazil.\
        \ Lund explored as many as 800 caves. In one of them, situated not far from\
        \ the lake of Semidouro, he found the bones of no less than thirty individuals\
        \ of the human species, showing a similar state of decomposition to that of\
        \ the bones of animals which were along with them. Among these animals were\
        \ an ape, various carnivora, rodents, pachyderms, sloths, &c. From these facts,\
        \ Lund inferred that man must have been contemporaneous with the megatherium,\
        \ the mylodon, &c, animals which characterised the quarternary epoch. Nevertheless,\
        \ M. Desnoyers, librarian of the Museum of Natural History at Paris, in a\
        \ very learned article on ' Grottos and Caverns,' published in 1845 in the\
        \ ' Dictionnaire Universel d'Histoire Natu relle,' still energetically expressed\
        \ himself in opposition to the hypo thesis of the high antiquity of man. But\
        \ the discoveries continued to go on ; and, at the present time, M. Desnoyers\
        \ himself figures", 1]
    - ['EPOCH OF TAMED ANIMALS. 149 plough-shares, call them pounds of butter, looking
        at the similarity of shape. At the present day these nuclei are plentiful
        in all the collec tions of natural history and geology. A strange objection
        has been raised against the antiquity of the hatchets, knives, and weapons
        found at Pressigny. M. Eugene Bobert has asserted that these flints were nothing
        else but the refuse of the siliceous masses which, at the end of the last
        century and especially at the beginning of the present, were used in the manufacture
        of gun flints ! The Abbe Bourgeois, M. Penguilly FHaridon, and Mr. John Evans
        did not find much difficulty in proving the slight foundation there was for
        this criticism. In the department of Loire-et-Cher, in which the gun-flint
        manufacture still exists, the residue from the process bears no resemblance
        whatever to the nitclei of Pressigny ; the fragments are much less in bulk,
        and do not present tbe same constantly-occurring and regular shapes. Added
        to this, they are never chipped at the edges, like a great number of the flakes
        coming from the workshops of Touraine. But another and altogether peremptory
        argument is that the flints of Pressigny-le-Grand are unfitted, on account
        of the texture, for the manufacture of gun-flints. Moreover, the records of
        the Artillery Depot, as remarked by M. Penguilly l''Haridon, librarian of
        the Artillery Museum, do not make mention of the locality of Pressigny having
        ever been worked for this purpose. Lastly, the oldest inhabi tants of the
        commune have testified that they never either saw or heard of any body of
        workmen coming into the district to work flints. M. Eugene Bobert''s hypothesis,
        which MM. Decaisne and Elie de Beaumont thought right to patronise, is, therefore,
        as much opposed to facts as to probability. Very few polished flints are found
        in the workshops of Pressigny le-Grand ; it is, therefore, imagined that their
        existence commenced before the polished-stone epoch. According to this idea,
        the nuclei would belong to a transitional epoch between the period of chipped
        stone, properly so called, and that of polished stone. The first was just
        coming to an end, but the second had not actually commenced. In other words,
        most of the Pressigny flints have the typical shapes and style of cutting
        peculiar to the polished-stone age, but the polishing is wanting.', 1]
    - ["EPOCH OF EXTINCT ANIMALS. 57 But before proceeding any further, it is necessary\
        \ to inquire in what way these caverns could have been formed, in which we\
        \ find accumulated so many relics of the existence of primitive man. M. Desnoyers,\
        \ Librarian of the Museum of Natural History at Paris, is of opinion that\
        \ these caverns are crevices of the same class as metalliferous lodes, only\
        \ instead of containing metallic ores they must have been originally filled\
        \ by the deposits of certain thermal springs. Fig. 20. \u2014 Theoretical\
        \ section of the same Vein of Clay converted into a Cavern, after the hollowing\
        \ out of Valleys by diluvial Waters. Fig. 19 represents, according to M. Desnoyers'\
        \ treatise on caverns, one of these primordial veins in the carboniferous\
        \ limestone. At the time of the diluvial inundation, these veins were opened\
        \ by the im petuous action of the water. When thus cleared out and brought\
        \ to the light of day, they7 assumed the aspect of caves, as represented in\
        \ fig. 20. The European diluvial inundation was, as we know, posterior to\
        \ the glacial epoch. It is also likely that caverns were sometimes produced\
        \ by the falling in of portions of some of the interior strata, or that they\
        \ were formerly the natural and subterranean channels of certain water courses\
        \ ; many instances of this kind being now known in different countries. We\
        \ must also add that it is not probable that all caverns originated in the\
        \ same way ; but that one or other of the several causes just enumerated must\
        \ have contributed to their formation. Under the general denomination of caverns,\
        \ all kinds of subter ranean cavities are comprehended ; but it will be as\

        account, was the remarkable one of December 6, 1810, when the Historical Society,
        in compliment to the original settlers of this state, selected the festival
        of St. Nicholas (usually pronounced Santa Claus), the tutelar saint of the
        Dutch for their anniversary discourse and dinner. It is worthy of remark,
        that the Historical Society has continued the discourse, without the dinner;
        and our St. Nicholas Society, during its more recent history, has adhered
        to the dinner Avithout the anniversary address. The Histo rical Society accordingly
        assembled on Thursday, 6th Dec., 1810, at one o''clock, in the north court
        room in the City Hall, where they listened to an excellent occasional discourse
        by Hugh Williamson, for which he received the thanks of the society, with
        the request of a copy for publication. At four, p. m., the society r-eassembled
        at the Washington Hotel (Kent''s, 42 Broad street), where a table was most
        sumptuously spread for them, by Kent in his best manner, both as to choice
        Avines and delicate viands. Seventeen toasts were duly honored; Egbert Benson
        presided, and a full and true account of all the proceedings has been preserved
        by John Pintard, then librarian of the so< iety, Avhich account has been repro
        duced in sac simile by Mr. George H. Moore, his excellent successor. Our St.
        Nicholas Society, as we have seen, formerly commemorated the day by an address,
        as well as by a dinner. After a long interval, we renew, to-day, our ancient
        custom. Long may the Feast of St. Nicholas live Avith pleasant memories among

        \ from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command\
        \ of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the ' History of England.'\

        \ for years before ; and when at length he found himself at the very fountain\
        \ head of information, with an admirable collection of books at his disposal,\
        \ and undisturbed quiet to plan and execute as he pleased, he began his undertaking\
        \ with such care and pains as sometimes even provoke a smile. For it is not\
        \ a historian's scrupulous exactness as to fact which appears foremost in\
        \ the history of his work, so much as a curious anxiety \u2014 sometimes growing\
        \ quite painful in its intensity \u2014 about the \" correctness \" of his\
        \ English, and the careful elimination of every Scotticism from its pages.\
        \ He writes letter on letter on this subject, and, it is evident, worked with\
        \ a diligence scarcely comprehensible in these slipshod days, eliminating\
        \ every doubtful expression from his work. Scotland was then, as his biographer\
        \ reminds us, a kind of country, with a dialect full, not only of changed\
        \ words, hut of different idioms from those of pure English. All this trouble\
        \ seemed, according to his own account, to have received but a poor recompense\

        \ I commenced with the accession of the house of Stuart, an epoch when, I\
        \ thought, the misrepresentations of faction began chiefly to take place.\
        \ I was, I own, sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work. I\
        \ thought that I was the only historian that had at once neg lected present\
        \ power, interest, and authority, and the cry of popular prejudices ; and\
        \ as the subject was suited to every capacity, I expected proportional applause.\
        \ But miserable was my disappointment ; I was assailed by one cry of reproach,\
        \ disapprobation, and even detestation ; English, Scotch, and Irish, Whig\
        \ and Tory, Churchman and sectary, freethinker and religionist, patriot and\

        city approved of the plan. A circular was issued, and was promptly followed
        by a thorough canvass of the city, and over $20,000 was subscribed. At a special
        meeting held 18th January, 1864, Hon. John Young reported that Mr. Maclaren
        and himself had purchased the parcel of land extending from Bonaventure to
        St. Joseph street, which had been spoken of as a site, and whenever the Association
        required it, it could be had from them on pre cisely the same terms, and for
        the same price as they paid for it. It was at once determined to build on
        the site mentioned. A building committee was appointed, and the work was so
        vigorously pressed forward that on May 1st; 1866, the Association took possession.
        The frontage of the building is 54 feet, and from the pavement to the top
        of the cornice 58 feet. It is built of Ohio sandstone above the basement course,
        which is of lime stone. The elevation presents a neat appearance, consisting
        of three storeys of various designs. The general outline of the building is
        that of an I , and consists of two main portions, connected by a spacious
        hall going the entire height of the structure, and from a wide staircase on
        one side of the latter, access is given to the various rooms on each storey.
        The entrance to this hall is in the centre of the facade, and is 13 feet wide.
        On each side of it is a shop, having good cellar and accommodation, and in
        the rear portion are rooms intended for board and class rooms. The height
        of this storey is 14 feet 6 inches. On the first floor is the reading room,
        50 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 17 feet in height, with an entrance from the
        front hall or landing. The library is in the rear portion of the building,
        and is 48 feet by 28, and of the same height as the reading room. Between

        give some more particulars under Craigengillan, parish of Carephairn, and
        confine our remarks here, that the first of the name in connection with Ayrshire
        was Gilbert de Kethk, who was a witness to a charter in the reign of King
        Alexander IL, granted by Duncan, Earl of Carrick, in a.d. 1225, which is to
        be found in the Melrose chartulary. In the Ragman Roll we find a Duncan de
        Carletoun in Carrick, who swore fealty to King Edward I. in a.d. 1296, as
        well as Mestre Duncan de Carryk. They seem to have applied to one and the
        same person and descended from Duncan, Earl of Carrick. This was long after
        the MacCairills had got possession of Cruggleton. We have here the origin
        of the corruption of Cairilltoun to Carletoun. The scribe who entered the
        names on the roll was an English or foreign priest, and, as will be seen under
        Carleton, parish of Borgue, Carleton was a name well known in England, but
        quite distinct from that of Cairill, although sounding to the ear the same.
        The Cathcarts got the castle and land from King Robert the Bruce in a.d. 1324.
        The hill at Cairill toun rises abruptly to 520 feet in height. It is close
        to the sea, and gives the name to the bay. At high tides there is little space
        to pass without danger. The property is in Colmonell parish, about midway
        between Ballantrae and Girvan. As already stated, the proper spelling should
        be Cairilltoun. The foregoing about Cairilltoun we consider necessary, but
        our principal desire is to show on what basis the history handed down was
        founded. The authorities we will give could not have been known to those in
        Galloway, from whom the history came. When the first volume of this work was
        in the press, our attention was directed to the ancient " Book of Deer,"*
        * This very ancient book was discovered in the University Library at Cambridge
        in 1860, by Henry Bradshaw, the librarian. As described by the late Professor
        Cosmo Innes, who tilled the chair of History in the University of Edinburgh,
        " recording facts still more archaic, reaching, in deed, a period of history
        which neither charter nor chronicle among us touches, and of which we have
        hitherto had only a few glimpses from the', 1]

        \ way,\" which is refuted by history. Bitson, to qualify so much error, has\
        \ the following in a note : \u2014 \" Perhaps in both instances it should\
        \ have been Stretgludwalensium, or the like, no other ancient English author\
        \ ever mentioning the Galwegians at so early a period. The same writer (Matthew),\
        \ among the eight petty sovereigns who rowed King Edgar's barge up and down\
        \ the river Dee in 974, names ' Jacobo rege Galwalli\xE6,' by whom also he\
        \ probably intended Strath- Clyde, if, in fact, that kingdom had then existence.\"\
        \ So much for Kitson as an authority on this point. He was right, for Galloway\
        \ was not then known under that name, and how could James be king ? One of\
        \ the Chronicles by the same writer also makes mention of the earl (jarl)\
        \ of Galloway, although the period is before the Norse occupation, and such\
        \ a title then unknown in the province. The whole proves the want of authenticity,\
        \ coupled with errors, accounted for by having been written many centuries\
        \ afterwards. The genuine ancient Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, so faith fully edited\
        \ by B. Thorpe in 1861, by order of Govern ment, is very different ; not a\
        \ name is given in connection with King Edgar's pageant. The translation is\
        \ as follows: \u2014 \" 972. In this year Eadgar \xC6theling was hallowed\
        \ king, ifec, ifec, and he was then thirty years old wanting one. And forthwith\
        \ after that, the king led all his naval force to Chester ; and there came\
        \ to meet him six kings, and all swore fealty to him that they would be his\
        \ co-operators by sea and by land.\" Such is the ancient Chronicle. The next\
        \ chronicler was William of Malmesbury, so called from being a monk and the\
        \ librarian of the monastery there. He died in 1143. Be states: \u2014 \"\

        \ lock had in the time of Rameses been the mark of youthful royalty ; under\
        \ the Ptolemies the mark of high rank ; but was now common to all. Diodorus\
        \ treated it as an offence against his religion. For this he was attacked\
        \ and killed, with George and Dracontius. The mob carried the bodies of the\
        \ three murdered men upon camels to the side of the lake, and there burned\
        \ them, and threw the ashes into the water, for fear, as they said, that a\
        \ church should be built over their remains, as had been sometimes done over\
        \ the bodies of martyrs. (44) When the news of this outrage against the laws\
        \ was brought to tbe philosophical emperor, he contented himself with threatening\
        \ by an imperial edict that if the offence were repeated, he would visit it\
        \ with severe punishment. Epistoi\xE6. But in every act of Julian we trace\
        \ the scholar and the lover of learning. George had employed his wealth in\
        \ getting together a large library, rich in historians, rhetoricians, and\
        \ philosophers of all sects ; and, on the murder of the bishop, Julian wrote\
        \ letter after letter to Alexandria, to beg the prefect and his friend Porphyrius\
        \ to save these books, and send them to him in Cappadoeia. He promised freedom\
        \ to the librarian if he gave them up, and torture if he hid them ; and further\
        \ begged that no books in favour of Christianity should be destroyed, lest\
        \ other and better books should be lost with them. (45) There is too much\
        \ reason to believe that the friends Socrates, \xB0f Athanasius were not displeased\
        \ at the murder of Ecci. Hist, the bishop George and their Arian feBow-Christians\
        \ ; at any rate they made no effort to save them, and the same mob that had\
        \ put to death George as an enemy to paganism, now joined his rival Athanasius\
        \ in a triumphal entry into the city, when, with the other Egyptian bishops,\
        \ he was allowed to return from banishment. Athanasius could brook no rival\
        \ to his power ; the civil force of the city was completely overpowered by\
        \ his party, and the Arian clergy were forced to hide themselves, as the only\
        \ means of saving their lives. But, while thus in danger from their enemies,\

        . .700 1,103 17 10 Besides the estate and rental already described, there
        are other important advantages appertaining to this school. Two exhibitions
        were founded in 1615, by Mr. WiUiam Wheat, for two poor scholars, 3/. each,
        towards their maintenance at the University, for the space of the first four
        years, to be chosen out of the Grammar School of this city ; the sum of 13s.
        4d. was also bequeathed by him to the librarian of the same school. In the
        year 1656, Mr. Thomas Lane bequeathed a large amount of property for charitable
        purposes, one of which was to make provision for " the fitting of poor scholars
        for the University, and towards their maintenance there for the space of seven
        years and a-half," such sum not to exceed 51. per annum before going to the
        University, nor above 10/., or under twenty nobles, when there; but an increabe
        in the value of the property has caused the number of the exhibitions to be
        increased and the allowance very considerably augmented, as will be hereafter
        shown. In the year 1691, the reverend Samuel Frankland, master of the school,
        left by will to the master and fellows of Katherine Hall, Cambridge, certain
        property for the maintenance of a fellow in the said hall, to be sent out
        of the Coventry Free School. It is directed by tne will, that the fellowship
        shall be called " The Frankland Fellowship," and that the nomination and election
        thereto shall be in the said master and fellows, so as they should have a
        careful regard to the recommendation of the mayor and aldermen of the city
        of Coventiy. Among other munificent benefactions to this city, Sh Thomas White
        founded two fellowships at St. John''s College, Oxford, to which college the
        corporation pay annually the sum of 40/., or thereabouts, in consideration
        of which two scholars from this school are entitled to the presentation to
        the said fellowships. The bequest of Mr. Lane requires that the " poor scholars
        " should be of the county of Warwick and of the city and county of the city
        of Coventry; but though these terms do not distinctly name the Coventry Free
        School, yet the bequest being made to its trustees, the inference and the
        usage alike have taken it to mean so.', 1]
    - ["g26 HISTORY OF COVENTRY. &c* The dead-house is at the extreme limit of the\
        \ hospital ground, at the back, and is of course detached entirely from any\
        \ other part of the building. In the front of the hospital there is a piece\
        \ of land laid out and planted ornamentally, and enclosed within iron palisades\
        \ of appropriate design, with a carriage drive through, by means of two gates,\
        \ and a flight of steps leads up to the principal door. The entire cost of\
        \ completion considerably exceeded the amount mentioned in the contract. This\
        \ excellent institution, as already intimated, is maintained by the liberality\
        \ of annual subscribers in the city and county, by donations, legacies, charitable\
        \ bequests, and other means of aiding its funds. In its management thc utmost\
        \ care is taken to secure the best professional attention for both in-door\
        \ and out-door patients, and many thousands who have participated in its benefits\
        \ can attest its value. LYING-IN CHARITIES. There are two charities of long\
        \ standing in Coventry, established for the purpose of affording the requisite\
        \ assistance and provision during confinement to the wives of poor and deserving\
        \ mechanics and labourers One is mainly supported bv friends and members of\
        \ the established church, by means of donations and annual subscriptions,\
        \ and a \" charity ball,\" which takes place about the commencement of every\
        \ year. The other is maintained by the contributions of the various Nonconformist\
        \ bodies m Coventry. Both are under the management of their respective committees\
        \ of ladies, and are judiciously administered. THE COVENTRY LIBRARY. This\
        \ old local institution was formed in the year 1790-1, and for almost half\
        \ a century was supported by nearly all the best educated portion of the inhabitants.\
        \ It was the nucleus around which gathered the literary and intellectual tastes\
        \ of the day, when books were costly, and only the highest order of talent\
        \ found expression through the medium of the press. The Coventry Library was\
        \ at first established, and for many years continued to be held, in premises\
        \ at the north end of the old Broad Gate, with the view down Cross Cheaping,\
        \ the line of building forming an angle and junction with the Castle Inn.\
        \ Ultimately the society of subscribers purchased the property in Hertford\
        \ Street, where the library is now held. It was originally built by a body\
        \ of Dissenters as a place of worship ; the services being conducted partly\
        \ according to the forms of the Church of England. They had but a short existence,\
        \ however, and m 1829 the building was bought by the Library Society, and\
        \ fitted up for their own use. In 1856 considerable alterations were made,\
        \ a portion of the front part being converted into two shops or offices, and\
        \ let at a rental, a centre door forming the entrance to the library. One\
        \ of the galleries was appropriated as a deposit for .Parliamentary papers\
        \ and other documents, the other assigned to the resident librarian for domestic\
        \ use : and the large room on the ground floor was suitably arranged and furnished,\
        \ so as to make it a comfortable and commodious place of resort for members.\
        \ But in the course of time the character and tone of the market for literature,\
        \ the habits and tastes of a much more numerous reading public, and the coming\
        \ into existence of other literary institutions, which provided libraries\
        \ for their members, operated greatly to the prejudice of the old society\
        \ and its material interests ; so much so, that in March, 1864, matters were\
        \ brought to something like a crisis, and at a general meeting of the subscribers,\
        \ the following resolution was adopted with only one dissentient : \u2014\
        \ \"That a transfer of the library, building, and books, &c, subject to the\
        \ liabilities thereon, be offered to the Town Council of this city for the\
        \ purpose of establishing a Free Library.\" In communicating this resolution\
        \ to the city Council, it was accompanied by a statement that the library\
        \ comprised about 17,000 volumes, and that the building was charged with a\
        \ mortgage debt of 1,200/., with half-a-year's interest at sour per cent,\

        Cassim Bey and others of the Mame lukes, " one of which had been newly furnished,"
        he remarks with bitterness, " out of the vexatious exactions on the property
        of the people." The French had a library in the house of Hassan Kiashef, the
        Georgian, and the librarians gave books to all who desired them. Here were
        chairs, and on a book being asked for, it was read in silence, and the extract
        written out ; for all the French, great and small, knew how to read and write.
        When a Moslem, attracted by curiosity, presented him self, he was received
        with politeness and smiles, and when it was seen that he was a man of intelligence,
        he met with increased attention, and was shown books in which were maps of
        all countries, animals, birds, plants, the ancient histories of the prophets,
        their portraits, their miracles, and all sorts of surprising things. " I have
        been several times," says Abderrahman, " to this library, and have been shown
        a quantity of curious things. There was a large volume containing the history
        of the Prophet with his noble portrait, depicted as far as their capacity
        could reach. He is standing looking at heaven and threatening the people,
        his right hand armed with a sabre, having a book in his left hand. French
        men, too, were to be seen, who knew the verses by heart, and some who recited
        verses of the Koran. They have a great desire to instruct themselves in languages,
        above all in the Arabic ; they work at it night and day, and have many books
        and dictionaries which facilitate the work of translation. The astronomer

        we gathered that his discourse was on the benefits and blessings conferred
        by the sovereign Pontiff on the faithful, through the medium of the approaching
        year of jubilee, which amongst other advantages, opens a new door for the
        forgiveness of the sins of the people. He concluded his sermon as usual by
        an appeal to the liberality of the audience. I am convinced there are individuals
        in this land, and even among the priest hood, who however incredible it may
        appear to some, by the force of education and early habit, implicitly believe
        in the doctrines of the Church of Rome, and are faithful to the little light
        they have. But how much must that Church have to answer for, which for purposes
        of State or priestly policy, keeps the people in ignorance of the first rudiments
        of learning, withholds from them by edict the free circulation of the Holy
        Scriptures, and takes away the right of private judgment in matters of religion.
        However unwilling to admit so harsh a term, there must be much of the spirit
        of Antichrist in this, " which prefers darkness rather than light, because
        their deeds are evil," and not bottomed upon the pure and unchangeable precepts
        of the Gospel. (3) St. Chrysogono, which is not very unlike the preceding,
        except that the roof is painted by Guercino, and represents the ascent of
        the patron saint to heaven. Its altar has four columns of rare alabaster.
        (4) St. Cecilia, built on the site of the house once occupied by that musical
        saint, whose powers in this way, says the poet, " once drew an angel down,"
        is a neat edifice, and rather handsome. The statue of the saint, by Maderno,
        which lies under the high altar, is of very delicate execution, and supposed
        to represent the posture in which her body was found. These churches are all
        on the Transtyberim side of the river. gth. Being introduced by a letter from
        our Vice-Consul to Mons. Mai, the learned librarian, we went this morning
        to visit the splendid apartments constituting the Library of the Vatican The
        principal body of this library, esteemed one of the largest in the world,
        is two hundred and sixteen feet in length, by forty-eight wide, to which there
        is a con tinuation, crossed at the bottom by two long galleries, extending
        together to four hundred paces, the walls and ceilings of which are adorned
        with paintings and arabesques. The books and manuscripts are arranged in armoires,
        or cases, and are not as usual exposed to view. We were shown here a very
        curious old Russian calendar of carved wood, of the tenth century, which contained

        leaning lump of brick, called " the Garesenda," which is not far from it.
        The Piazza del Gigante, a fine open square, used as a market, is a lively
        spot when strewed over with all the produce of the country exposed for sale.
        In the centre is the justly celebrated bronze statue of Neptune, by John of
        Bologna : a noble and commanding object, and of very exquisite workmanship
        ; but I think with some modern travellers, that it would have been better
        placed in some fine seaport, where this god of the ocean might have appeared
        more in his true character, surrounded by his native element. We visited in
        their course the Palaces Zembaccari and Aldrovandi, both rich in fine galleries
        of well arranged pictures, and then proceeded to the University, which is
        indeed a noble institution, and deservedly the glory of the city : it contains
        a fine collection of books, consisting of two hundred thousand volumes, well
        arranged under the care of the learned Abbate Mezzofante, the librarian ;
        a fine collection of plaister casts of celebrated statues, a museum of natural
        history, a cabinet of ancient statues, and other antiquities, mummies, and
        other Egyptian curiosities ; a very curious school of anatomy, a chambre d''accouchement,
        a series of philosophical instruments, very complete and in fine order ; and
        amongst other interesting objects a much admired mosaic of Pope Pius V, which
        had all the beauty of a finished painting. From the University we pro ceeded
        to the Museum " Des Beaux Arts : " a splendid collection of paintings, in
        w-hich the great masters of the Bolognese school hold a very prominent place
        ; and it is here only that a just and accurate idea of the merits of Guido
        Reni, Domenichino, and the Carracci can be obtained, of whose works there
        are magnificent specimens in this noble gallery : some idea may be formed
        of their value from the French being compelled to restore to it sixty-five
        pictures. Amongst the most precious we noted with pleasure some fine pieces
        by Pietro Perugino, and Francia : " The Crucifixion " and " The Massacre of
        the Innocents," by Guido Reni, are in his very best manner, and are only rivalled
        by his "Apostles " at Milan ; the " St. Cecilia " of Raphael is also a sublime
        picture ; the " Madonna Delia Rosario," vulgarly called " The Persecution
        of the Albigenses," and " The Martyrdom of St. Agnes," by Domenichino," are
        both magnificent works ; " The Transfiguration " and " Madonnas " of Ludovico
        Carracci have also great excellence of execution : but time would fail me
        to enume rate the most excellent, and it is a hopeless task when I reflect
        that it is impossible to convey to others even a faint idea of such varied
        excellence.', 1]

        conduct us to the Armenian Convent, on the Island of St. Lazarus, about two
        miles from the city, where we were courteously received by Father Pascal Aucher,
        the learned librarian, who speaks English with ease and fluency ; and is truly
        described by a modern traveller as " a man of great learning, very extensive
        knowledge of the world, and most amiable manners." Of his learning he has
        given us a convincing proof, by the translation of the prayers of St. Nersetis,
        one of the Armenian saints, into twenty-four dif ferent languages, a copy
        of which I purchased on our return to Venice. By him we were politely shown
        the church, the convent, the library, with a good collection of printed books
        ; and another, very rich in Armenian manuscripts, some of which were of an
        early date ; also the school rooms and the printing rooms : in the latter
        they were occupied in printing an Armenian prose translation of Milton''s
        "Paradise Lost," which the learned Father informed us he intended afterwards
        to reduce to measure. He also showed us several other works which had issued
        from their press, and recognised us as Friends, having seen us disembark the
        day we arrived in Venice from the windows of " The Leone Bianco," where he
        was dining with Hudson Gurney, and which adjoins our inn. We much regretted
        the shortness of this interview, which the limited time we had unfortunately
        allowed ourselves in Venice did not pennit us to repeat. From hence we crossed
        over to the Island of Loddo, which lies between Venice and the open Adriatic
        ; and landing, walked over the ancient burial-place of the Jews, to the sea,
        where we bathed, much en joying our dip, after the fatigues of the day. Loddo
        is for the most part a barren, sandy island, and reminded me much of the lowlands
        that skirt the sea under the cliffs of Walton and Felixtowe, in Suffolk. Here
        Lord Byron kept his four horses, humorously alluded to by Matthews, as forming,
        in conjunction with the four bronze horses of Lysippus, all the stud possessed
        by the Venetians ; and here, upon the loose sands, he got "his short canter."
        Venice and its vicinity will naturally recall to the classic traveller many
        remembrances of this illustrious author, in con junction with Shakespeare,
        Otway, and Schiller, who have laid in this spot the scene of some of their
        dramas. It was impossible, here espe cially, to think of the former without
        regret that his splendid powers of description should ever have been alloyed
        by any baser material. After dinner, the gondola again brought us to St. Mark''s
        Place, to enable us to contemplate that noble square by the light of the full

        \ was now eager to act the conqueror ; and, in spite of the promises of safety\
        \ on which these brave Copts had laid down their arms, he had them tied to\
        \ his chariot wheels, and copying the vices of men whose virtues he could\
        \ not even understand, like Achilles and Alexander, he dragged them living\
        \ round the city walls, and then ordered them to be put to death. He then\
        \ led the army to Naucratis, which was the port of Sais, and there he embarked\
        \ on the Nile for Alexandria, and taking with him a further body of mercenaries,\
        \ which Aristonicus had just brought from Greece, he entered the city in triumph.\

        \ Polycrates in his wise and careful management. His chief aim was to keep\
        \ 2^^' the province quiet, and his next to collect the taxes. He was at first\
        \ distrusted by the Alexandrian council for the large sum of money which he\
        \ had got together and kept within his own power ; but when he sent it all\
        \ home to the empty treasury, they were as much pleased as they were surprised.\
        \ (81) Apollonius, whom we have spoken of in the reign of Euergetes, and who\

        \ to Alexandria in the beginning of this reign, and made librarian of the\
        \ Museum on the death of Eratosthenes. But he did not long enjoy that honour.\
        \ He was already old, and shortly died at the age of ninety. (82) The coins\

        \ style in which Callimachus threw out his biting reproaches. We do not know\
        \ from what this quarrel arose, but it seems to have been the cause of Apollonius\
        \ leaving Alexandria. He removed to Ehodes, where he taught in the schools\
        \ during all the reign of Philopator, till he was recalled by Epiphanes, and\
        \ made librarian of the Museum in his old age, on the death of Eratosthenes.\
        \ (23) Lycophron, the tragic writer, lived about this time at Alexandria,\
        \ and was one of the seven men of letters sometimes called the Alexandrian\
        \ Pleiades, though writers are not agreed upon the names which fill up the\
        \ list. His tragedies are all lost, and the only work of his which we now\
        \ have is the dark and muddy poem of Alcandra, or Cas sandra, of which the\
        \ lines most striking to the historian are those in which the prophetess foretells\
        \ the coming greatness of Eome; \"that the children of \xC6neas will raise\
        \ Liuel227 the crown upon their spears, and seize the sceptres Diogenes of\
        \ sea and land.\" Lycophron was the friend of La\"-1*-1\"8- Menedemus and\
        \ Aratus ; and it is not easy to believe that these lines were written before\
        \ the overthrow of Hannibal in Italy, and of the Greek phalanx at Cynocephal\xE6\
        , or that one who was a man in the reign of Philadelphus should have fore\
        \ seen the triumph of the Eoman arms. These words may have been a later addition\
        \ to the poem, to improve the prophecy. (24) Conon, one of the greatest of\
        \ the Alexandrian astro nomers, has left no writings for us to judge of his\
        \ merits by, though they were thought highly of, and ou\xE6st.' made great\
        \ use of, by his successors. He worked v\"' 3 both as an observer and an inquirer,\
        \ mapping out the heavens by his observations, and collecting the accounts\
        \ of the eclipses which had been before observed in d^rchlme- Egypt. He was\
        \ the friend of Archimedes of Syracuse, to whom he sent his problems, and\
        \ from whom he received that great geometrician's writings in return. (25)\
        \ Apollonius of Perga came to Alexandria in this reign, to study mathematics\
        \ under the pupils of Euclid. He is well known for his work on conic sections,\
        \ or the several curves which are made by cutting a cone ; and he may be caUed\
        \ the founder of this study. The Greek mathematicians sought after knowledge\
        \ for its own sake, and, unlike ourselves,", 1]
    - ["CHAP. VIII.] THE MUSEUM. 319 Cicero thought him the great master in the art\
        \ of speaking, and seems to have taken him as the model upon which he wished\
        \ to form his own style. He wrote upon philosophy, history, government, and\
        \ poetry ; but the only one of his works which has reached our time is his\
        \ treatise on elocution; and the careful thought which he there gives to the\
        \ choice of words and to the form of a sentence, and even the parts of a sentence,\
        \ shows the value then set upon style. Indeed, he seems rather to have charmed\
        \ his hearers by the softness of his words, than to have roused them to noble\
        \ deeds by the strength of his thoughts. . He not only advised Ptolemy Soter\
        \ what books he Regum' should buy, but which he should read, and he chiefly\
        \ \xBBP\xB0Ph^** recommended those on government and policy ; and it is alike\
        \ to the credit of the king and of the librarian, that he put before him books\
        \ which, from their praise of freedom and hatred of tyrants, few persons would\
        \ even speak , of in the presence of a king. But Demetrius had Laertius, also\
        \ been consulted by Soter about the choice of a llb' v' successor, and had\
        \ given his opinion that the crown ought to be left to his eldest son, and\
        \ that wars would arise between his children if it were not so left ; hence\
        \ we can hardly wonder that, on the death of Soter, Demetrius should have\
        \ lost his place at the head of the Museum, and been ordered to leave Alexandria.\
        \ He died, as courtiers say, in disgrace ; and he was buried near Diospolis,\
        \ in the Busirite nome of the Delta. According to one account he was put to\
        \ death by the bite of an asp, in obedience to the new king's orders. (32)\
        \ Soon after this we find Zenodotus of Ephesus filling the office of librarian\
        \ to the Museum. He was a \u201E .. poet, who, with others, had been employed\
        \ by Soter in the education of his children. He is also known as the first\
        \ of those Alexandrian critics who turned their thoughts towards mending the\
        \ text of Homer, and to whom we are indebted for the tolerably correct state\
        \ of the great poet's works, which had become faulty through the carelessness\
        \ of the copiers. Zenodotus was soon followed by other critics in this task\

        \ Philopator had yet inherited the love of letters which has thrown so bright\
        \ a light around the whole of the family ; and to his other luxuries he sometimes\
        \ added that of the society of the learned men of the lSus! Museum. When one\
        \ of the professorships was lib. vii. 177. gmpty, he wrote to Athens, and\
        \ invited to Alex andria Sph\xE6rus, who had been the pupil of Zeno. One day\
        \ when Sph\xE6rus was dining with the king, he said that a wise man should\
        \ never guess, but only say what he knows. Philopator, wishing to tease him,\
        \ ordered some waxen pome granates to be handed to him, and when Sph\xE6rus\
        \ bit one of them, he laughed at him for guessing that it was real fruit.\
        \ But the Stoic answered that there are many cases in which our actions must\
        \ be guided by what seems probable. None of the works of Sph\xE6rus have come\
        \ down to us. (52) Eratosthenes, of whom we have before spoken, was \u201E\
        \ , librarian of the Museum during this reien ; and Ptolemy, the son of Agesarchus,\
        \ then wrote his Atben\xE6us, history of Alexandria, a work now lost. It was\
        \ not, however, from their want of accuracy that these Alexandrian historians\
        \ have been allowed to perish. None but a few scholars will turn aside from\
        \ the cares and pleasures of life, from earning their livelihood, or even\
        \ from the amuse ments of idleness, to read books written without life or\
        \ feeling. Had these historians been so fortunate as to have been witnesses\
        \ of a series of great and good actions, or had they been warmed with a love\
        \ for their fellow-creatures, or had they had an aim after what was noble,\
        \ or even had their pages contained a clear picture of the manners and customs\
        \ of their times, the world would not have let them die. (53) The want of\
        \ moral feeling in Alexandria was poorly \xC6iianus supplied by the respect\
        \ for talent. Philopator built V. h. xiii. there a shrine or temple to Homer,\
        \ in which he \"\u25A0 placed a sitting figure of the poet, and round it seven\
        \ worshippers, meant for the seven cities which claimed the honour of giving\
        \ him birth. Had Homer himself worshipped in such temples, and had his thoughts\
        \ been raised by no more lofty views, he would not have left us an Iliad or\
        \ an Odyssey. In Upper Egypt there was no such want of re ligious earnestness\

        \ Mr. Hoy, added to his simple and primitive habits, rendered him universally\
        \ respected and noted iu the neighbourhood of Gordon Castle; and in the noble\
        \ family in which he resided, he maintained with all the same familiar footing\
        \ that his celebrated prototype, whom we have named above, preserved at Ellangowan.\
        \ Mr. Hoy was born at Haining, in Selkirkshire, in the year 1747. His father\
        \ was gardener to Pringle of Haining, or Clifton, afterwards Lord Ailmore,\
        \ one of the lords of session, and his lordship's daughter, Miss Violet Pringle,\
        \ observing young Hoy to be a steady sedate lad, had him educated, according\
        \ to his parents' wishes, for the dissenting church. Lord Ailmore becoming\
        \ blind, young Hoy was engaged to be his reader and companion. Even at this\
        \ early period, he must have discovered considerable signs of scientific genius,\
        \ for he had an offer to go to Ireland with Banks and Solander, as botanist,\
        \ and to assist in other depart ments Of science. \" It was as a sort, of\
        \ literary companion, and as one able to scale the different heights and bearings\
        \ round Gordon Castle, that Mr. Hoy was recommended to the Duke, and scarcely\
        \ any other situation could have been so admirably calculated to promote his\
        \ own happiness ; for, as his whole enjoyment was in books, so that which\
        \ was his delight now became his duty. To him the charge of the Duke's library\
        \ was committed. It became the castle of which he was appointed governor,\
        \ and he was never out of his garrison except at meal-times, or when called\
        \ into the fields by his scientific pursuits ; or on Sundays, when he never\
        \ failed, let the weather be what it might, to mount his horse, to ride to\
        \ Elgin to attend the Seceder meeting house. As the Duke's engagements and\
        \ occupations de prived him of sufficient leisure to peruse the numerous books\
        \ of miscellaneous information which were continually appearing, it became\
        \ Mr. Hoy's business to devote his forenoons to reading them as they arrived\
        \ ; and then he was enabled, as they sat tete-a-tete over their bottle of\
        \ claret together after dinner, to fill the Duke with all that was worth remembering,\
        \ and his grace's memory was ouch, that it never afterwards lost what it thus\
        \ received. \" Mr. Hoy's chief sciences were astronomy, entomology, and botany.\
        \ To the first of these he adhered steadily till his dying day, and made almost\
        \ daily observations on the heavenly bodies; and from his having undertaken\
        \ the regulation of the clocks at Gordon Castle and Fochabers, it was matter\
        \ of notoriety that his was the only accurately kept time in the north of\
        \ Scotland. \"We need scarcely say that Mr. Hoy was quite indif ferent to\
        \ fame ; he equally despised riches, never seeking for more than might enable\
        \ him to dispense some charities, and to afford himself respectable clothes,\
        \ of which he never had more than two suits at a time. When his kind and indulgent\
        \ patron voluntarily offered him an addition to his sixty-pound salary, he\
        \ replied, ' Keep it to your sel', my Lord Duke, I'm no needin' mair ; ye\
        \ hae as muckla need o't as I hae.' When Burns was at Gordon Castle he was\
        \ particularly delighted with Hoy's blunt manner, and perhaps the circumstance\
        \ of his being a native of the Borders gave him an additional value in the\

        \ I shall, without prelude, address myself to the subject which has evoked\
        \ these simul taneous gatherings in every part of the world One hundred years\
        \ ago, a Scottish peasant was born, who in his Use was first flattered and\
        \ tempted then scorned and neglected by the great, and whose world-wide fame\
        \ now craves a demonstration altogether without precedent. There is a pretty\
        \ impromptu by James \u2022 \"We shall assign to the Centenary Celebration,\

        \ a little bit here aud there from the great mass, and that principally from\
        \ the chief meetings in Edinburgh and Glasgow, as being more immediately associated\
        \ with the scenes of the poet's life.\"\u2014 G.", 1]

    - ["PREFACE. It is somewhat remarkable that Temple Bar, with all its historical\
        \ recollections, and Fleet Street, with all its interesting associations,\
        \ should have hitherto escaped the historian's pen ; and this is the more\
        \ surprising because there is no street in the City of London \u2014 perhaps\
        \ in the world \u2014 which can boast of such a store of \" time honoured\"\
        \ reminiscences. Antiquarians have regretted that the citizens, with all their\
        \ love for ancient institutions, should have allowed so remarkable a locality\
        \ to remain so long without its chronicle; especially, if nothing else were\
        \ wanting to make its history renowned, that in it, nearly four centuries\
        \ ago, lived, printed, died, and was buried, the second printer in the Metropolis,\
        \ and that in \"Fleet Street, the Printing Press has flourished ever since.\
        \ Honest John Stow, who has told his readers that his Chronicle cost him \"\
        \ many a weary mile's travel, many a hard-earned penny and pound, and many\
        \ a hard winter's night study,\" has curiously enough made little mention\
        \ of the City Gate and the City street \u2014 in fact in his original \" Survey,\"\
        \ 1598, he only notices Temple Bar as adjoining Shire Lane ; leaving us to\
        \ find out that it was then a building. Many histories and local works upon\
        \ London, some of rarity and value, have been published since then, but it\
        \ has been left to the present writer, himself a native of Pleet Street, to\
        \ be the first to launch a separate work upon its General History. Every library\
        \ likely to give information has been looked into, and many musty documents\
        \ turned over, but his only fear is that the matter will probably be found\
        \ \" dry \" \u2014 perhaps more so than ordinary historical works of the present\
        \ age ; but this failing in a sensational period is the result of his desire\
        \ to give as many facts in a cheap and collected form, so as to be within\
        \ the reach of every Citizen of London. But I must acknowledge that without\
        \ great assistance, even this humble attempt would have proved a failure.\
        \ My friends have been most numerous and kind, as will be found throughout\
        \ the pages of these \" Memorials.\" Tet I cannot refrain from tendering,\
        \ in this place, my best thanks to the Eev. Canon Auriol, M.A., Bector of\
        \ St- Dunstan's ; the Bev. Canon Marshall, M.A., Vicar of St. Bride's ; the\
        \ Masters of the Bench of the Hon. Society of the Inner Temple ; P. Woodthorpe,\
        \ Esq., Town Clerk of the City; \"W. H. Overall, Esq., F.S.A., Librarian at\
        \ Guildhall, aud his assistant,", 1]

        \ by John Norden in the original manu script of his account of Middlesex in\
        \ the British Museum, and first printed in 1593.* As we have already stated,\
        \ there is no mention made of Temple Bar as a Gate before the sixteenth century,\
        \ although searches have before now been made through the most complete collection\
        \ of records belonging to any city in the world \u2014 records extending back\
        \ over six centuries, and which, thanks to the citizens of 1869, are about\
        \ to have a fitting library and strong-room erected, not only for their safe\
        \ keep ing, but also for the valuable collection of printed books on the City\
        \ and general history, now numbering some 30,000 volumes. f It is through\
        \ the great kindness and courtesy of the present Town Clerk of the City, F.\
        \ Woodthorpe, Esq., that I am enabled to give some extracts from these ancient\
        \ records relating to the Bar. The First entry to be found is dated 1502 j,\
        \ and relates to the custody of Temple Bar at the period of some excitement\
        \ not stated : \u2014 17 Hen. 7. [1502] Broke Aldn, \u25A0> Assignate ad custodiend\

        \ appear pretty conclusive that a building of some sort then existed beyond\
        \ an ordinary bar across the street. At all events, there is some interest\
        \ attached to it, because Robert Fabian, who was alderman of our ward of Farringdon,\
        \ but better known as the author of the \" Chronicle,\" which bears his name,\
        \ rjrobably here performed his last civic work of any consequence as an alder\
        \ man, for in that same year he resigned his gown on the plea of poverty.\
        \ He had served office as sheriff 1493 ; John Brook in 1489 ; and John Warner\
        \ in 1494. It is thirty years later, in 1533, that we have the first notice\
        \ of Temple Bar as a building \u2014 when \"sweet Anne Bullen \" passed from\
        \ the Tower to her coronation at Westminster, on the 31st May; when the Fleet\
        \ Street Conduit, surmounted by angels, and with music that made \" a heavenly\
        \ noyse,\" poured claret and red wine ; and Temple Bar was \"newly paynted\
        \ and repayred, where stood also divers singing men and children.\" || When\
        \ the youthful Edward \"of fair memory the Sixth\" passed to his coronation\
        \ February 19th, 1547, the Bar was \"painted and fashioned with battlements\
        \ and buttresses of various colours, richly hung with cloth of arras, and\
        \ garnished with fourteen standards of flags ; there were also eight French\
        \ trumpeters blowing their trumpets, after the fashion of their country, and\
        \ a pair of regals with children singing to the same.\" It is at this date\
        \ that we have the earliest picture of the Bar, and by no means a light structure\
        \ was it. The ancient painting of this coronation procession formerly existed\
        \ in one of the apartments of * \"This gattewas throwne downe by the Kentish\
        \ rebels in the time of Ric. 2.\"\u2014 Specvlum Britanni\xE6 (Harl. MS.,\
        \ 570, so. 41 B). + I cannot refrain from mentioning three citizens' names\
        \ who have been engaged in this necessary and seasonable work : Mr. B. B.\
        \ Orridge and Dr. W. S. Saunders, the past and present chairman of the Guildhall\
        \ Library Committee, and Mr. W. H. Overall, the Corporation librarian. It\
        \ was a bright event in the City aunals when, on July 22, 1809, Dr. Saunder's\
        \ proposal to erect a library worthy of the City was unanimously adopted by\
        \ the Common Council. ; \"Repertory\"!, so. 20b. || \" Stow's Chronicle,\"\

        \ launched at Eton. But, over and above the salary, Mr Thompson became entitled,\
        \ as librarian, to apartments in Belmore House. It would thus be impossible\
        \ for his lordsliip to visit London, even for a day, without her being made\
        \ acquainted with the circumstance ; nor to go forth upon secret expeditions,\
        \ except under the eye of a most vigilant observer. On the whole, therefore,\
        \ assuming his lordship's game to be such as she believed it to be, there\
        \ seemed a better chance for her to follow and counterwork it from the country,\
        \ than if she remained a con stant resident in town. On the other hand, the\
        \ scandal, should such be raised, about her adven ture in Hanover Square,\
        \ and the mode of her deliverance from it, would run its course and die out\
        \ without attracting her lord's notice. Thus, odious as was the prospect of\

        \ canal existed so far as their roadways were concerned, but scarcely a vestige\
        \ of parapet re mained, while the canal itself was almost choked fringe of\
        \ suburbs and outer circle of buildings adjoining them, but belonging properly\
        \ to the city within the 111, suffered heavily. The stately picture gallery\
        \ in the Kleberplatz was gutted from basement to roof; the archiepiscopal\
        \ and imperial palaces, as well as other fine mansions near the minster, were\
        \ much damaged ; and bridges over the canals were entirely smashed, and the\
        \ houses in the Quai des Bateliers, Quai des Pecheurs, Place de Broglie, &c,\
        \ were all greatly injured. The cathedral was to all external ap pearance\
        \ uninjured. The spire, though it had been struck in more places than one,\
        \ was as attractive a spectacle as ever. The cross on its summit appeared\
        \ to have been touched by a pro jectile, as it leaned to one side. Some of\
        \ the ornamental work had been carried away, and a portion of the stone stair\
        \ in one of the side towers destroyed. The outer roof of the nave had been\
        \ burned, and the windows here and there pierced with balls; but the famous\
        \ clock escaped, and the cathedral was on the whole in excellent condition,\
        \ owing to the orders of the Prussian commander, who would not permit a single\
        \ bullet to be fired against it, except at the commencement of the siege,\
        \ when the French used it as an observatory. In the promenade, where the bands\
        \ were wont in times of peace to play of afternoons, trees and lamp-posts\
        \ were lying about amongst Louis Qua torze chairs and all sorts of old fashioned\
        \ furniture saved from burning houses; whilst even the little orchestra, struck\
        \ by a shell, was partly smashed and partly burnt. No less than 448 private\
        \ houses were entirely destroyed, and out of the 5150 in the town and suburbs\
        \ nearly 3000 were more or less injured; 1700 civilians were killed or wounded,\
        \ and 10,000 persons made houseless. The estimate of the total damage to the\
        \ city was nearly \xA38,000,000. \u2014 quite choked towards its southern\
        \ extremity \u2014 with barges and boats of every kind smashed and sunken\
        \ with everything they contained. All that remained of the citadel, at one\
        \ time deemed by its possessors almost impregnable, was huge masses of rubbish\
        \ produced by the incessant fire from the batteries of Kehl on the one side,\
        \ and the bombs thrown from those near Schiltig heim on the other. One of\
        \ the first acts of Lous XIV. on taking the city in 1681, was to dislodge\
        \ the Protestants from the cathedral, which they had occupied from the period\
        \ of the Reformation. The Dominican church, which had long been secularized,\
        \ was allotted to them instead, and had its name changed to that of the Temple\
        \ Neuf. It had one of the most famous organs of Silbermann. In the choir,\
        \ divided from the nave, was lodged the special glory of Alsace \u2014 its\
        \ library, the finest on the Rhine, in which the archives, antiquities, topo\
        \ graphy, and early printing collections were trea sured. All perished. Since\
        \ the apocryphal burning of the library of Alexandria, perhaps no equally\
        \ irreparable loss has occurred. Unfortunately no catalogue of its many treasures\
        \ exists. An elaborate one in MS. had been prepared by the librarian, but\
        \ that also perished. A very fine work, the \" Alsace Antiquary,\" perished\
        \ among them \u2014 sixteen folio vols. of MS. upon Strassburg. Greatest loss\
        \ of all was that of the most precious record connected with the discovery\
        \ of printing \u2014 the documents of the legal process instituted by Gutenberg\
        \ against the heirs of his partner Dreisehn, to establish his right as the\
        \ inventor of typography. Among the early specimens of typo graphy there was\
        \ a copy of the first German Bible, printed by Mentelin about 1466, but undated;\
        \ also three early Latin Bibles by Mentelin, Jenson, and Eggestein, the last\
        \ bearing the manuscript date 1468. There was, besides, a rare copy of Virgil\
        \ by Mentelin, a still rarer Cofnmentary of Servius upon that poet, printed\
        \ by the celebrated Valdarfer; a Jerome's \"Epistles,\" by Schoeffer, 1470;\
        \ and about 4000 other books printed before the beginning of the sixteenth\
        \ century. Immediately aster the capitulation, subscriptions were opened in\
        \ Berlin and Frankfort to relieve the suffering Strassburgers, and restore\
        \ the town; but towards the latter object little was raised, as the magnitude\
        \ of the ruins seemed to render the efforts of private charity utterly inadequate.\

        \ of the soldier, he was welcomed ; alone, he was barely tolerated ; and the\
        \ insolence of the Portuguese party added to the ill-will with which he was\
        \ regarded. With sad hearts the Catholic priests dismantled the temples they\
        \ had reared and preserved with such devotion ; and in the year 1634 a band\
        \ of prisoners in the hands of the Turks represented the once triumphant hierarchy\
        \ of Ethiopia. The imperial mandate and the protest of the Patriarch Mendez\
        \ \u2014 a protest said to have been written at a later date than is attached\
        \ to it, and from a more secure place than Massowah \u2014 are they not written\
        \ in the chronicles of Tellez ? After wading through the earlier authorities,\
        \ it is a great relief to arrive at the observations of a man like Ludolf,\
        \ who could look at the history of a distant country with no more prepossession\
        \ or bias than a slight suspicion of the accuracy of Jesuits. Ludolf had one\
        \ great advantage over many other historians in that he enjoyed a personal\
        \ intimacy with a well-informed native of the country \u2014 the Abbas Gregory.\
        \ The title of the Ethiopian is not a little puzzling, but it appears that,\
        \ without the sanction of any bishop or university, Gregory assumed the title\
        \ of Abbas by consent of his countrymen, and in right of his superior learning.\
        \ Gregory, born at Melana Cenace, in Amhara, and educated by the Jesuit priests,\
        \ displayed all the elements of a good Churchman ; and, on the banishment\
        \ of his patrons, had elected to follow them, being allowed, by the prudent\
        \ tolerance of the Roman authorities, to retain a leaning to the Coptic ritual\
        \ while admitting the supremacy of the pontiff. In Europe he took pains to\
        \ impress on the minds of his acqaintance that he was no man of the people,\
        \ but \" of the Amharican house and lineage of nobles, who are governors of\
        \ the Ethiopian house, who command and rule in the name of the king.\" Gregory\
        \ was staying at Rome in the year 1649, when Ludolf, who was at that time\
        \ librarian to the Duke of Gotha, wrote to invite him to Erfurt, the residence\
        \ of his mother. Writing in Ethiopian characters, it would seem that the librarian\
        \ was not so distinct in his penmanship as he might have been ; and Gregory,\
        \ after inquiring in vain for \" Erfahrt \" \u2014 the reading he put on the\
        \ language of the letter \u2014 abandoned the idea of availing himself of\
        \ the invitation. Circumstances, however, subsequently admitted of his making\

  - - ["PEBFACE. It is somewhat remarkable that Temple Bar, with all its historical\
        \ recollections, and Fleet Street, with all its interesting associations,\
        \ should have hitherto escaped the historian's pen ; and this is the more\
        \ surprising because there is no street in the City of London \u2014 perhaps\
        \ in the world \u2014 which can boast of such a store of \" time honoured\"\
        \ reminiscences. Antiquarians have regretted that the citizens, with all their\
        \ love for ancient institutions, should have allowed so remarkable a locality\
        \ to remain so long without its chronicle; especially, if nothing else were\
        \ wanting to make its history renowned, that in it, nearly four centuries\
        \ ago, lived, printed, died, and was buried, the second printer in the Metropolis,\
        \ and that in Fleet Street, the Printing Press has flourished ever since.\
        \ Honest John Stow, who has told his readers that his Chronicle cost him \"\
        \ many a weary mile's travel, many a hard-earned penny and pound, and many\
        \ a hard winter's night study,\" has curiously enough made little mention\
        \ of the City Gate and the City street \u2014 in fact in his original \" Survey,\"\
        \ 1598, he only notices Temple Bar as adjoining Shire Lane ; leaving us to\
        \ find out that it was then a building. Many histories and local works upon\
        \ London, some of rarity and value, have been published since then, but it\
        \ has been left to the present writer, himself a native of Fleet Street, to\
        \ be the first to launch a separate work upon its General History. Every library\
        \ likely to give information has been looked into, and many musty documents\
        \ turned over, but his only fear is that the matter will probably be found\
        \ \" dry \" \u2014 perhaps more so than ordinary historical works of the present\
        \ age ; but this failing in a sensational period is the result of his desire\
        \ to give as many facts in a cheap and collected form, so as to be within\
        \ the reach of every Citizen of London. But I must acknowledge that without\
        \ great assistance, even this humble attempt would have proved a failure.\
        \ My friends have been most numerous and kind, as will be found throughout\
        \ the pages of these \" Memorials.\" Tet I cannot refrain from tendering,\
        \ in this place, my best thanks to the Eev. Canon Auriol, M.A., Eector of\
        \ St- Dunstan's ; the Eev. Canon Marshall, M. A., Vicar of St. Bride's ; the\

        \ the British Aluseum, and first printed in 1593.* As we have already stated,\
        \ there is no mention made of Temple Bar as a Gate before the sixteenth century,\
        \ although searches have before now been made through the most complete collection\
        \ of records belonging to any city in the world \u2014 records extending back\
        \ over six centuries, and which, thanks to the citizens of 1869, are about\
        \ to have a fitting library and strong-room erected, not only for their safe\
        \ keep ing, but also for the valuable collection of printed books on the City\
        \ and general history, now numbering some 30,000 volumes. \\ It is through\
        \ the great kindness and courtesy of the present Town Clerk of the City, F.\
        \ AVoodthorpe, Esq., that I am enabled to give some extracts from these ancient\
        \ records relating to the Bar. Tho First entry to be found is dated 1502 %,\
        \ and relates to the custody of Temple Bar at the period of some excitement\
        \ not stated : \u2014 17 Hen. 7. [1502] Broke Aldn, .. Assignate ad custodiend\

        \ would appear pretty conclusive that a building of some sort then existed\
        \ beyond an ordinary bar across the street. At all events, there is some interest\
        \ attached to it, because Bobert Fabian, who was alderman of our ward of Farringdon,\
        \ but better known as the author of the lm Chronicle,\" which bears his name,\
        \ probably here performed his last civic work of any consequence as an alder\
        \ man, for in that same year he resigned his gown on the plea of poverty.\
        \ He had served office as sheriff 1493 ; John Brook in 1489 ; and John AVarner\
        \ in 1494. It is thirty years later, in 1533, that we have the first notice\
        \ of Temple Bar as a building \u2014 when \"sweet Anne Bullen\" passed from\
        \ the Tower to her coronation at AVestminster, on the 31st Alay; when the\
        \ Fleet Street Conduit, surmounted by angels, and with music that made \"\
        \ a heavenly noyse,\" poured claret and red wine ; and Temple Bar was \"newly\
        \ paynted and repa3'red, where stood also divers singing men and children.\"\
        \ || AVhen the youthful . Edward \"of fair memory the Sixth\" passed to his\
        \ coronation February 19th, 1547, the Bar was \"painted and fashioned with\
        \ battlements and buttresses of various colours, richly hung with cloth of\
        \ arras, and garnished with fourteen standards of flags ; there were also\
        \ eight French trumpeters blowing their trumpets, after the fashion of their\
        \ country, and a pair of regals with children singing to the same.\" It is\
        \ at this date that we have the earliest picture of the Bar, and by no means\
        \ a light structure was it. The ancient painting of this coronation procession\
        \ formerly existed in one of the apartments of * \"This gattewas throwne downe\

        \ 1570, of a reputable family, which had been settled in the borough for many\
        \ years. He was the fifth son of John James and Jane Annemon, of Newport.\
        \ He was the learned author of \" Bellum Papale,\" first edition in quarto,\

        \ Dr. Thomas James already noted. He was born in Newport about 1592, 'and\
        \ was a very learned man. He left a MS. entitled \" Antiquitates Insul\xE6\
        \ Vect\xE6,\" and hitherto unpublished. It is evidently the preliminary to\
        \ a large and elaborate work, and is still preserved among his MSS. in the\
        \ Bodleian Library, Oxford. He died at the house of Sir Thomas Cotton, Westminster,\

        \ The Rev. Edmund Kell, an eminent Hampshire antiquary, is the third son of\
        \ the late Rev. Robert Kell, a Unitarian minister and schoolmaster. Mr. Kell\
        \ was born at Wareham, in Dorsetshire, January 18, 1799 ; educated in his\
        \ father's school ; entered Glasgow University October, 1815, and in 1819\
        \ was taught elocution there by Sheridan Knowles. Graduated M.A., and left\
        \ college in 1821. After this he was two years at the Man chester College,\
        \ York, and his tutors there were the Rev. C. Wellbeloved, the antiquary,\
        \ and the Rev. John Kenrick, M.A., F.S.A. Came first to the Isle of Wight\
        \ in 1823, as minister at High Street Chapel, Newport, and continued such\
        \ all the time of his residence in the Island. Commenced a board ing and day\
        \ school in 1827, and continued it till about 1841. On the 24th October, 1844,\
        \ Mr. Kell was married in his own chapel by the Rev. H. Hawkes, to Elizabeth,\

    - ['80 A GENERAL GUIDE TO vicar, is from the designs of Mr. Giles. The National
        Schools, a well-proportioned building in Albert Street, were designed by Mr.
        Turner, of Southampton. The Cottage Hospital for Consumption and Diseases
        of the Chest enjoys royal patronage. The town is governed under the Local
        Government Act. One cheerful line of street, forming High Street, Church Street,
        and Belgrave Road, reaches from St. Boniface Villa, at the eastern end of
        the town, to the Royal Hotel at its western extremity. The " Ventnor and Bonchurch
        Literary and Scientific Institution " was established in the year " 1850,"
        and is situated in the High Street. The well known Rev. James Wrhite, of Bonchurch,
        was the first president, and Mr. Keet is the librarian. Down-stairs in the
        reading-room there are three or four shelves of fossils. Here are also two
        interesting and local relics of the old French war, both of which were washed
        out of the chalk cliff, and found on Ventnor Beach. One is an 18-pounder cannon-ball,
        which by breaking in half has disclosed a perfect 7-pound ball inside it.
        The other is a specimen of chain-shot, and has a 7-pound ball at each end.
        The length is about 14 inches. It is perfect and fine. Both were presented
        by old Mr. Hall, who was in the Coast Guard and a geologist. Up-stairs in
        the girls'' school-room are nine shelves of fossils and shells, also three
        fine fragments of a Samian vessel. (85) There are no labels to anything, and
        the collection is in no sort of order. Many of the fossils were collected
        by S. M. Saxby, Esq., late of Bonchurch, and have been pre sented to the institute
        by Dr. Leeson. The Isle of Wight Mercury, published every Thursday evening
        at Ventnor, devotes a large space to its local and fashionable news, with
        full lists of Resi dents, Arrivals, and Departures. The Isle of Wight Advertiser,
        published on Saturday at Ventnor, besides local and general news, gives also
        a weekly list of Residents, Arrivals, and Departures. In 1848 a wide and very
        pleasant esplanade was formed on the sea-beach in the Cove, and extended from
        the cascade beneath the parsonage nearly to the Undercliff Baths. The shore
        in the Cove is covered with fine shingle, and at each end is strewn with large
        fragments of rock. Two or three of these rocks at the western end bear a strong
        resemblance to the large solitary stone at Stonehenge. In this bowl-shaped
        cove we are really at the sea-side, and can enjoy it in all its glory. The
        cliff walk in the direction of St. Lawrence is a charming spot. A noisy and
        pretty little brook hurries down the cliff, and flows across the shingle into
        the sea below Steephill Castle, where the path crosses it by a board thrown
        over, which is 4 feet 6 inches long, by 1 foot 2^ inches wide. Just above
        this little bridge is a cascade 2 feet in depth. Steephill is the seat of
        J. Hambrough, Esq., whose father did so much for the good of the town, and
        the castle is admirably situated, rising boldly from among a mass of trees.
        Just beyond this, and below the cliff walk, is a pleasant and sheltered cove,
        clothed with short turf, and sprinkled over with bramble bushes and bracken.

        near the White Horse Cellar, watched till the equip age came up. It usually
        stopped at Brooks''s ; and in front of Brooks''s the librarian took up a position.
        From that position he neA^er budged till the object of his vigilance reappeared,
        whose steps he tracked Avith unwavering diligence to the Bank, to the law-courts

        Mr Thomp son, putting judiciously into the background the fact that he had

        any kind, till sleep, induced by sheer physical weakness, stole over him and
        refreshed his body. After this he would rise, often to find that the better

        gentlemen, who find the news room a convenient place to pass an hour, or to
        meet a friend, when they come into Reading. The president of this institution
        is R. Benyon, Esq., M.P., and the secretaryship is now held by Mr. John Egginton.
        St. Giles''s Church of England Society, for religious and intellectual improvement,
        is a valuable organization in St. Giles''s parish, its members, according
        to the last annual report, numbering 180. They meet at St. Giles''s Hall,
        London street, where they have a library, consisting of 600 volumes, and a
        news room well supplied with daily and weekly papers. This hall is well adapted
        for parochial gatherings, there being convenient galleries round three sides
        of it in addition to the space on the ground floor. During the year several
        lectures are given here under the auspices of the society, and also a few
        musical entertainments. This society, instituted in 1859, is now in a flourishing
        condition ; the library and news room are much used, the meetings are generally
        well attended, and the number of members- is annually increasing. St. John''s
        Reading-room is situated in Princes- street, near St. John''s Church. This
        room is spacious, and conveniently fitted up, and is well adapted for the
        purpose for which it is used. It was opened two years ago at the expense of
        Mr. Alfred Sutton, who takes great interest in its management. There are about
        500 volumes in the library, and the tables are furnished with local and London
        papers, as well as numerous useful magazines. A Mothers'' Meeting and Bible
        Classes are held regularly here. There are on the books 107 members, and the
        flourishing condition of the institution proves that it was greatly needed
        in this thickly populated neighbourhood, and also evinces that the kindness
        of its founder has been fully appreciated. St. Mary''s Parish Rooms are in
        Gun-street. There are two very comfortably furnished rooms which, when necessary,
        can be thrown into one by means of folding doors. In the one room is the library
        containing upwards of 500 select volumes, and in the other are papers and
        periodicals, comprising all the local, and the most interesting of the London
        papers. The reading-room is opened daily, and the librarian attends on Monday

        \ meeting there were enrolled eighty-seven members, of whom five remain in\
        \ the school as officers, teachers and scholars, to wit : C. M. Haller, Superintend\
        \ ent; Seaton Halsey, Secretary and Librarian; AA7m. S. A. Garver and Mrs.\
        \ F. E. Halsey, Teachers, and Mrs. M. Clymer (then Mary Hiller) as a member\
        \ of the Bible class. There have been connected with the school, as shown\
        \ by the records, 1,125 members, of whom 125 are now in connection therewith,\
        \ making an average Sabbath attendance of 90. The library numbers 434 volumes.\

        \ membership was made by the organization of another Union school by the United\
        \ Brethren and Methodist Episcopal, in the United Brethren Church. The next\
        \ was by the Evangelical Association withdrawing and forming the Union Sunday\
        \ School of the Evangelical Association. About this time, the school became\
        \ virtually an Evangelical Lutheran Sunday School, if not in form, in fact,\
        \ so that on the 11th day of September, A. D. 1871, a new constitution was\
        \ adopted, and the name of Evangelical Lutheran Sabbath School of Forreston\
        \ printed in its catalogues. Thus it has passed through two decades under\
        \ the same superintendency, with the exception of one year, when Dr. J. B.\
        \ E. Albright was Superintendent. Zion's Reform Church, of the Reformed Church\
        \ of the United States, was organized .about 1857, by Rev. George AVeber,\
        \ he having been preceded in mis sion work by Rev. John A. Leis. Then followed\
        \ as Pastors: Revs. Henry Bassler, George AVeber again in 1859, Charles W.\
        \ Seaman, Francis A. Edmonds, Charles Kuepper, Cyrus Cort, a supply, and C.\
        \ G. A. Hullhorst, for one year, after whom came Rev. Daniel Lantz, who has\
        \ continued five years to the present time. The brick church building, 38x54\
        \ feet in size, was erected in 1870 at a cost of $7,000, and is located on\
        \ the corner of B and Third streets. Sabbath School was organized in January,\

        \ A. Forrest & Co., on the west side of Rock River, are operating what is\
        \ known as the Southwestern Mills, and are engaged exclusively in the manufacture\
        \ of oat meal. These mills were built in 1873, at a cost of $45,000. The water\
        \ power is bought of the Mix estate. A switch of the Chicago k Iowa Railroad\
        \ runs up to the mills, a distance of one mile from the main track. The main\
        \ build ing stands upon the bank of the river, while just across the track\
        \ is the store house and elevator. The oats are taken to the top of this building,\
        \ and there conveyed through a tin spout 104 feet in length to the main building.\
        \ There are three kilns in the mills, where the oats are dried. Three water-wheels,\
        \ of the Phelps pattern, are used in the working of the mill. Five pairs of\
        \ burrs are in use. The mill gives employment to twenty men, and produces\
        \ 200 bushels of meal per day. Three thousand bushels of oats are received\
        \ at this mill daily, of which 2,000 bushels are made into meal. Their sales\
        \ are principally in Eastern cities and foreign countries. * The Oregon Mills,\
        \ on the East Side, were built in 1861, by Mix, Sheets & Petrie, at a cost\
        \ of $16,000, and were operated by them until January, 1878. Sheets and Petrie\
        \ bought the Mix share in 1876. The mills are now being operated by Mr. Z.\
        \ B. Sturtevent, formerly a prominent mill owner at Rock ford. Mr. Sturtevent\
        \ employs five men, and produces seventy-five barrels of flour a day. They\
        \ have four run of stone, and all the necessary machinery, including that\
        \ used in making the \"new process\" flour. The Oregon Feed Mills were built\
        \ in 1877-78, and are the property of C. D. Irvine. The mills are driven by\
        \ water power, by means of a wire cable 600 in length. In addition to the\
        \ feed-mill, there is a grist-mill attach ment, turning lathe, circular saw,\

        BRADFORD COUNTY HISTORICAL SOCIETY. A number of times a few young men of congenial
        spirit have been temporarily associated together in their respective neighborhoods
        to do Christian work, but not until 1865 was there an organization effected
        of what have been so widely known as Young Men''s Christian Associations.
        That year Rev. Mr. Harris came to Towanda to supply the pulpit of the Presbyterian
        church. He had been a chaplain in the army, and familiar with the various
        ap proved agencies for Christian work. On coming to To wanda one of his efforts
        was to organize the young men into a Christian Association. In this he found
        in all of the churches a few ready and willing workers. Money was secured,
        a reading-room obtained and furnished, prayer meetings instituted, a closer
        union effected between Chris tian people, and a desire for more earnest Christian
        work was fostered. Pursuant to previous notice, a number of the citizens of
        Bradford County, having a desire for the preservation of whatever was of historical
        interest in the county, met in Mercur''s hall, in Towanda. May 4, 1S70. and
        organized the meeting by calling Hon. L. P. Statford, of Wyalusing, to the
        chair, and appointing Dr. E. P. Allen, of Athens, sec retary. A committee,
        consisting of Messrs. Ward, Kinney, Herrick, Hale, Mason, Craft, and Worden,
        was appointed to report a plan of organization, which subsequently reported
        a constitution and code of by-laws, which were adopted, by which action "
        The Historical Society of Bradford County, Pennsylvania," became a verity.
        The first article of the constitution states the object of the society to
        be " the elucidation of the history of this State ; though other branches
        of history shall not be excluded." The officers were declared to be a president,
        two vice-presidents, a cor responding and a recording secretary, a treasurer,
        and a libra rian; their duties to be such as are usually performed by such
        officers in other societies. All persons signing the constitution and complying
        with the terms thereof, before or at the first annual meeting, were to be
        deemed members, and the by-laws prescribed a ballot for such members after
        wards. Ten dollars paid at one time constituted a life mem ber, with an exemption
        from further dues ; otherwise, an annual contribution of one dollar from members
        is required. Thirty-six members added their signatures to the constitu tion,
        and thirteen honorary or corresponding members were elected. Messrs. Montanye,
        Alvord, and Craft were ap pointed a committee on nominations, and reported
        the following list of officers, who were elected for one year, to wit: President,
        C. L. Ward, Esq, Towanda; Vice-Presi idents, Dr. Darius Bullock, Smithfield
        ; Hon. F. B. Streeter, Towanda; Recording Secretary, Dr. E. P. Allen, Athens;

        the association secured the services of Rev. E. P. Hammond, an evangelist,
        whose labors were blessed in the most wide-spread general re vival ever before
        known in Towanda. The association continued to maintain its reading-room for
        some time, but at length interest flagged, and it ceased to exist. In 1875
        the association was again revived, continued for nearly two years, when it
        was disbanded, its property sold, and the proceeds disposed of. At Troy an
        association was organized about the time of the reorganization in Towanda.
        A fine room was secured and neatly furnished ; a weekly and Sabbath evening
        ser vice was established, and good results have come from it. BRADFORD COUNTY
        DENTAL ASSOCIATION. In 1859 the American Dental Association was formed, to
        which the several previously-organized State associations "were made auxiliary.
        The Pennsylvania Dental Society was instituted Dec. 2, 1868, and May 8, 1869,
        a number of the dentists of Bradford County met at Towanda and organized the
        Bradford County Dental Association, as auxiliary to the State association.
        It had a small begin ning, commencing with only four members. Dr. Weston,
        of Towanda, was the first president, and Dr. Dusenberry secretary. Committees
        on finance, library, and publication were appointed. Messrs. Hayden, of Athens,
        and Craft, of Wya lusing, were requested to each prepare an address for the
        next meeting. Accordingly, Mr. Craft at the next meeting read to a large audience
        a paper giving an account of the French at Asylum. At a subsequent meeting
        Dr. Allen read a paper on the animal remains found in the Chemung and Susquehanna
        valleys. Among the first things attempted by the society was to gather the
        history of the county. It has succeeded in collecting some valuable material,
        while a lar"-e collection of Indian relics and curiosities has been placed
        in its keeping. The society holds its meetings semi-annually in different
        localities, and usually continues its sessions through two days. At these
        meetings there is the freest possible dis cussion of everything relating to
        the profession, inter spersed with the reading of essays on special topics.
        There is also a free clinic at each session. In short, the general object
        has been to elevate the character of the profession and improve the standard
        of work. The meetings of the society have been of such increas ing interest
        that several members of the profession from adjacent counties became connected
        with it. The society now includes the leading dentists of Bradford County.
        The meetings of the association are always open, and the public arc at liberty
        to attend. It not unfrequently hap pens that visitors from different parts
        of the State are pre sent at its sessions. Dr. J. K. Newell, of Wyalusing,
        is the president, and Dr. Kelly, of Towanda, the secretary In 1873. the society
        appointed a committee for the spe cific purpose of collating the history of
        the county. This duty was entirely confided to the editor of this work, which
        is the result of his efforts in carrying out the wishes of the society. Colonel
        John F. Means, of Towanda, is the pn si dent, and W. W. Kingsbury the secretary,
        for 1S7S. The society has been incorporated by the decree of the court of
        Bradford County, and has ever had on its roll of member ship names representing
        the oldest .-mil most prominent families in the county. for 1S78.', 1]

        \ to be kept permanently in Wysox township. Previous to this date a library\
        \ had existed in Orwell, and it was arranged that the books then in that library\
        \ should be received on subscriptions to the new asso ciation. The whole number\
        \ of subscribers was 154, who subscribed for 189 shares, Robert Ridgway taking\
        \ six, S. T. Barstow, William Keeler, and Naphtali Woodburn, four each, and\
        \ Jacob Bell, three. Eighteen others sub scribed for two shares each, and\
        \ the balance was made up by single shareholders. The first meeting of the\
        \ association was held at Jacob Myer's, February 6, 1813, at which Thomas\
        \ Elliott was chosen moderator and J. M. Piollet secretary. Dr. S. T. Barstow\

        \ 3, 1834. The association, being unincorporated, could not enforce its by-laws,\
        \ and the subscribers became careless about returning the books, and, in 1839,\

        \ parliament, it was stoutly held for the king by brave old John Arundel,\
        \ of Trerise and Tolverne, (\"John for the King\") and despite blockade, and\
        \ blandishment it held out till stern necessity com pelled surrender. On the\

        \ to the Parlia ment, and though, since that time, various additions have\
        \ been made to it, it is but a shadow of its former self. The defenders of\

        vice-superintendent; James Cole, librarian; and Samuel B. Clark, clerk, who
        was succeeded, Aug. 10 of the same year, by J. D. Taylor. A room in one of

        and used by the school for many7 years. At present its sessions are held in
        the school-house, which is also used for public worship. The winter of 1856
        and ''57 was made memorable by a great revival, in which over fifty were con
        verted. During the war a Soldiers'' Aid Society was formed, an exhibition
        was given by the young people for its benefit, and valu able aid was rendered
        at a time when it was most needed. Over twenty of the young men of the village
        enlisted in the loyal army ; two of them lost their lives in the service of
        their country, and to-day sleep beneath Southern soil. Seldom has White Rock,
        in the winter season, been without either a singing school, evening school,
        or lyceum. Its " Excelsior Club " had an existence of over two years. In reviewing
        the history of this village, we feel the conviction that it has contributed

    - ['HISTORY OF BENTON COUNTY. 429 Vinton (as described in the Eagle of September
        17th), in 1859, had four teen houses engaged in general trade, one banking
        house, two insurance agencies, eight attorneys, five physicians, one dentist,
        twenty-five builders, two furniture shops, one milliner, three blacksmith
        shops, one plow factory, one harness shop, one tailor, three shoe shops, one
        jeweler, four hotels, a stage office, two butcher shops, two livery stables,
        three secret societies, two printing offices, one female seminary, five religious
        organizations, one steam saw-mill and one ferry. Eighty-five buildings had
        been erected in the preceding twelve months, and nineteen were at that time
        in process of construction. FLOURING MILLS. The establishment known as the
        Vinton Mills was erected in the Fall of 1857, by J. F. & W. H. Young, at a
        cost of about $20,000. It is run by steam, and has three four-foot buhrs.
        The Eagle Mills, owned by Durand & Kimball, were built in 1869 or 1870. In
        1861, the population of Vinton, by census taken in September, was 1,010; 477
        males and 533 females. A "Young Men''s Christian Association" was formed December
        21, 1867, with S. A. Knapp as President ; B. R. Sherman, Vice President ;
        S. H. Watson, Treasurer; J. W. Bar, Secretary; H. M. Hoon. Librarian ; B.
        R. Sherman, S. Williams, James Wood, Alex. Sanderson, Geo. Pierce, Directors.
        A small library was soon afterward procured, most of the books of which are
        still preserved, and are kept at the Herald office. Perhaps it would be a
        good plan to turn the library over to the Reform Club, lately organized, by
        which society it could be made the basis for a library worthy of the town.
        RAILROAD AT LAST. The people of Vinton had sought for more than fifteen years,
        and that al most without ceasing, to obtain a road through the county seat
        ; but every pro ject failed of accomplishment until 1865, when an organization
        was effected at Cedar Rapids, called the Cedar Rapids k St. Paul Company,
        which promised to build a road through Benton County by way of Vinton for
        the sum of $75,000, and the further donation of the county''s swamp lands,
        worth some $15,000 more. In 1868, the franchise of the company and the grading
        that had been done became the property of the Burlington & Cedar Rapids Com
        pany, which gave renewed vitality to the enterprise. The officers of the Bur
        lington Company at that time were : George Green, President ; Charles Ma son,
        Vice President; R. M. Green, Secretary; J. W. Traer, General Agent. In the
        hands of these energetic men the road was completed from Cedar Rapids to Cedar
        Falls about New Year''s, 1870. The first train arrived at Vinton Dec. 12,
        1869, and the occasion was cele brated by a banquet at the Asylum on the 21st.
        A large number of guests from Cedar Rapids attended. In 1873, what is now
        known as the Dakota Divison of this road was begun at Vinton, and constructed
        to Traer in Tama County. It has since been ex tended into Grundy County, and
        during 1878 will cross the Iowa Division of the Illinois Central. The Burlington
        system of roads has thus placed Vinton in position to thriye for many years
        ; and the coming of the locomotive has produced a marked change in the appearance
        of the town. Rows of brick buildings, filled with goods and thronged with
        customers, daily bear witness of the happy emancipation of the town from the
        irregular movements of little steamboats, the insufficiency of stage coaches
        and freight wagons.', 1]

    - ["OLD SOUTHWARK AND ITS PEOPLE. 304 remains, he says, gives walls set at right\
        \ angles to each other ; the greatest extent from east to west, say, 630 feet\
        \ ; width, say, 225 feet. The arrangement, I quote his words, must have been\
        \ vast and magnificent. \" It is no difficult matter, and I conceive no presump\
        \ tion, to affirm that there were two large gateways on the west, three great\
        \ courts beside inferior ones, a second cloister, dormitory, and refectory.\
        \ The walls of the old abbey were not all taken down, but were used as foundations\
        \ and as part elevation by Sir Thomas Pope, some showing even now early brickwork\
        \ of the time of Edward IV.\" As to the old abbey and its people, I hope to\
        \ be able to give at some future time a special paper more in detail. To those\
        \ who are very curious and will take the trouble to separate wheat from chaff,\
        \ the papers left by Mr. Buckler to the British Museum will be vastly interesting.8\
        \ He often employs the word \"conjecture\"; but the books are full of facts\
        \ and sound inference. A curious first condition of this valuable bequest\
        \ is recorded in one of the volumes. The books were left on the condition\
        \ that they should be shut up from all inspection for thirty years, that is\
        \ until 1889. Happily for me, the Librarian of the British Museum prevailed\
        \ upon the donor to leave his bequest unconditionally, and that it should\
        \ be at once open to the public. Accordingly I have been able to copy some\
        \ of these most excellent notes and drawings. The notes contain a great deal\
        \ of verbal indignation against Sir Thomas Pope and other early spoilers of\
        \ the abbeys, who, it must be said, have all of them been very long asleep\
        \ ; \u2014 further, the living have condoned it all. And now, looking back\
        \ over the vista, it is hard to see how we could be what we are but for these\
        \ changes. The pictures of rooms and the plans in Wilkinson, and the map of\
        \ 1746, by Rocque, will repay manyfold any trouble that the interested inquirer\
        \ may take. Our public libraries, especially the British Museum and that at\
        \ the Guildhall, are conducted so liberally, and the attendance is, as a rule,\
        \ so courteously given, that any who wish to see may do so. I would add that\
        \ in the drawings of Buckler's the old walls of houses and gardens are \u25A0\

        \ the map or plan which has so opportunely turned up for our purpose, and\
        \ which faces the title. Many maps dealing largely with early Southwark have\
        \ come down to us. It is easy to see that fancy has dealt somewhat freely\
        \ with the seventeenth century maps of Hollar and others ; at the same time\
        \ it must be said that truth, with a difference, underlies them all. The same\
        \ may be said of the pictorial map of Van den Wyngrerde, dated 1543, now in\
        \ the Bodleian. Our plan from the Record Office,1 the text for this book upon\
        \ Old Southwark and its People, although limited and very roughly drawn \u2014\

        \ of those old places, the names of which so ring in our ears, and which were\
        \ of local importance in 1542. The map will also serve as some sort of test\

        and wheat, as at Ottumwa, on her return, she also took in a quantity of wheat.
        LYCEUM. A literary lyceum was organized in Ottumwa, November 23, 1849. The
        citizens were requested to get together at early candle-light. Already over
        $75 had been subscribed toward a library. The following officers were elected:
        Rev. B. A. Spaulding, President ; H. B. Hendershott, Vice President ; Ber
        trand Jones, Recording Secretary; J. W. Norris, Corresponding Secretary; R.
        H. Warden, Treasurer; James Leighton, Librarian. Their meetings were to be
        held weekly during the winter, and the programme was to include a short lect
        ure on some interesting topic, which was to be followed by d;-bates. The open
        ing lecture, by Rev. Mr. Spaulding, was upon the "Influence of Literary Insti
        tutions." The committee who drafted the Constitution and By-Laws consisted
        of Messrs. Baker, Norris and Warden. The first question discussed was: "Does
        the true policy of this country consist in the further extension of its territory?
        " At this first meeting, after organization, on the 7th of December, the audience
        was not large, owing to the tempestuous character of the night, but it was
        otherwise very satisfactory. PLANKROAD FEVER. In February, 1850, after some
        previous agitation on the subject, a plank road meeting was held to discuss
        the construction of a plankroad from Ottumwa to intersect the Burlington &
        Mt. Pleasant Plankroad at Mt. Pleas ant. Uriah Biggs was appointed President
        of this meeting ; Thomas Ping and John C. Evans, Vice Presidents, and Bertrand
        Jones, Secretary. There was a universal sentiment in favor of such a road,
        and a committee of prominent citizens was designated to represent the county
        at a Plankroad Convention to be held at Mt. Pleasant on the 27th of February,
        consisting of J. W. Norris, J. D. Devin, H. B. Hendershott, J. C. Ramsey,
        Thomas Ping, F. Newell, J. H. D. Street, S. M. Wright, Judge Baker, Dr. Flint,
        Gideon Myers, B. Boys ton, B. Jones, Joseph Hayne, J. M. Peck, Dr. Yeomans,
        Uriah Biggs, G. B. Savery, Dr. Wood and W. S. Carter. When the subscription-books
        were opened, Ottumwa responded with $8,700, Agency City with $5,000, and Ash
        land with $4,500. At a subsequent meeting, ten more names were added to the
        delegates to represent Wapello County at Mt. Pleasant, as follows : Dr. James
        Nosier, Madison Wellman, J. G. Baker. D. P. Inskeep, E. G. McKinney, W. G.
        Martindale, A. Ingraham, Andrew Major, William M. Dunlap and Joshua Marshall.
        At the same time of the plankroad interest, the people of Eddyville were wrought
        up to a fine fervor of enterprise over the construction of a toll-bridge across
        the Des Moines River at that place. STAGING IN 1850. The Courier of June 7,

        in school work, and a man universally recognized as a prudent and economical
        business man. And for this reason he was able to carry forward many reforms
        in the school manage ment, which might have failed if undertaken by others.
        At this time, Mr. L. M. Hastings was chosen Superintendent. He had had considerable
        experience in school work, was an excellent organizer and disci plinarian,
        as well as devoted to his work. He was continued as Superintendent until]
        873. Object-teaching was then attracting considerable attention, and the Board,
        not to be behind others, sent to Oswego, N. Y., and secured the services of
        Miss Pride, a graduate of the school there. She opened a school here in which
        the pupils were instructed according to the object method, and also gave instruction
        to a class of other teachers, who wished to be instructed in the new plan.
        This method is still continued in a degree in the present schools, and has
        been found of great benefit. Miss Pride was succeeded by Miss Ennis in this
        department, and she, in turn, by Miss Reeder and Miss Spaulding. Prof. Wilson
        Palmer succeeded Mr. Hastings as Superintendent in 1873, when he resigned,
        and the Board elected Prof. A. W. Stuart, who holds that office at the present
        time. The Presidents of the Board, since its organization as an independent
        dis trict, have been : T. C. Woodward, 1859 to 1862 ; W. J. Ross, 1862 to
        1864 ; C. C. WTarden, 1864 to 1869 ; S. B. Thrall. 1869 to 1871; C. C. Warden,
        1871 to 1872 ; J. W. Edgerly, 1872 to the present time. The schools of Ottumwa
        take a high rank among the schools of Iowa, as well as among those of the
        Western States. The Superintendents have been men of high rank in their profession,
        and they have been aided by a corps of teachers as good as could be procured.
        Special teachers are supplied to teach music and German. The High School especially
        is worthy of praise. The requirements for admission there are very nearly
        the same as for corresponding schools in Chicago and St. Louis. OTTUMWA BUSINESS
        COLLEGE. This school was established in June, 1871, by W. C. Caldwell and
        J. W. Oldham. They began with only one student, but were determined to succeed
        in introducing a practical educational institution. In 1872, Mr. Caldwell
        bought the interest of Mr. Oldham, and added a telegraphic department. In
        1874, Mr. C. sold out to Messrs. Fugate k Thompson, who greatly increased
        the business. The College is an established concern, and is steadily growing
        in popular favor. The rooms are over the post office, on Main street. It is
        now conducted by Messrs. Strong & Shafer. OTTUMWA PUBLIC LIBRARY. A stock
        library was organized in March, 1^72, by several prominent gentle men of the
        city, among them being E. S. Sheffield, W. E. Chambers, E. Faw cett, J. C.
        Osgood and Rev. H. Bross. The first officers now are : Samuel Mahon, President;
        Rev. H. B. Knight, Vice President; J. W. Edgerly, Sec retary ; W. A. McGrew,
        Treasurer, and Miss Emma Daum, Librarian. There are 2,000 volumes in the library,
        all carefully chosen. This is in addition to all pamphlets and documents.
        The stock is placed at $2,000, and persons are entitled to the privileges

        \ organized at this date, yet it seems to have had but few meetings and to\
        \ have made but little progress until the year 1858. Meantime, Rev. Joseph\
        \ T. Roberts, LL. D., had settled with his family in Ottumwa, and in November\
        \ of that year, Rev. S. H. Worcester, of Granville. Ohio, accepted the call\
        \ of the Church and became its Pastor. From this time, regular meetings were\
        \ held, part of the time in the old Presbyterian Church. and part of the time\
        \ in the Court House. The social nieetings were often held in private houses.\
        \ The house of worship, corner of Fifth and Court streets, in which the Church\
        \ now meets, was erected in 1862. In 1866, it was enlarged. The pastorate\
        \ of Rev. S. H. Worcester continued until July, 1865, nearly seven years.\
        \ In May, 1866, Rev. S. L. Burnham began labor as Pastor, con tinuing until\
        \ February, 1868. During this time, the Pastor was assisted in a revival meeting\
        \ by Rev. Morgan Edwards, and many additions were made to the Church. In June,\
        \ 1868, Rev. R. A. Clapp became Pastor, and continued until March, 1871. Rev.\
        \ C. Darby followed for a short time, and in December. 1872, Rev. William\
        \ L. Brown became Pastor, serving two years and one month. During this pastorate,\
        \ Rev. H. W. Brown, Evangelist, aided the Pastor in a revival effort, and\
        \ a number were added to the Church. The present Pastor. Rev. J. Sunderland,\
        \ began his labors May 1, 1875. The Church has had seven Pastors. Though it\
        \ meets still in its first house of worship, it has purchased very eligible\
        \ lots on Third street, at a cost of $1,650, upon which it hopes soon to erect\
        \ a commodious house of worship. During all the time since it entered its\

        \ shared the lot of most literary collections, and been dispersed since the\
        \ death of its noble author. For these I am indebted to that industrious biblio\
        \ grapher Mr. O. Rich, now resident in London. Lastly, I must not omit to\
        \ mention my obligations, in another way, to my friend Charles Folsom, Esq.,\
        \ the learned librarian of the Boston Athen\xE6um, whose minute acquaintance\
        \ with the grammatical structure and the true idiom of our English tongue\
        \ has enabled me to correct many inaccuracies into which I had fallen in the\
        \ composition both of this and of my former works. From these different quarters\
        \ I have accumulated a large amount of manuscripts, of the most various character\
        \ and from the most authentic sources ; royal grants and ordinances, instructions\
        \ of the court, letters of the emperor to the great colonial officers, municipal\
        \ records, personal diaries and memoranda, and a mass of private correspondence\
        \ of the principal actors in this turbulent drama. Perhaps it was the turbulent\
        \ state of the country which led to a more frequent correspondence between\
        \ the government at home and the colonial officers. But, whatever be the cause,\
        \ the collection of manuscript materials in reference to Peru is fuller and\
        \ more complete than that which relates to Mexico ; so that there is scarcely\
        \ a nook or corner so obscure, in the path of the adventurer, that some light\
        \ has not been thrown on it by the written correspondence of the period. The\
        \ historian has rather had occasion to complain of the embarras des richesses\
        \ ; for in the multiplicity of contradictory testimony it is not always easy\
        \ to detect the truth, as the multiplicity of cross-lights is apt to dazzle\
        \ and bewilder the eye of the spectator. The present History has been conducted\
        \ on the same general plan with that of the Conquest of Mexico. In an Introductory\
        \ Book I have endeavoured to portray the institutions of the Incas, that the\
        \ reader may be acquainted with the character and condition of that extraordinary\
        \ race before he enters on the story of their subjugation. The remaining books\
        \ are occupied with the narrative of the Conquest. And here the subject, it\
        \ must be allowed, notwithstanding the opportunities it presents for the display\
        \ of character, strange romantic incident, and picturesque scenery, does not\
        \ afford so obvious advantages to the historian as the Conquest of Mexico.\
        \ Indeed, few subjects can present a parallel with that, for the purposes\
        \ either of the historian or the poet. The natural development of the story,\
        \ there, is precisely what would be prescribed by the severest rules of art.\
        \ The conquest of the country is the great end always in the view of the reader.\

        \ was a new one, by way of apology for its containing only twenty-three thousand\
        \ volumes. It possessed, however, eighteen hundred subscribers. There is,\

        \ to be absent about two months. As the result a cabinet of minerals and fossils\
        \ of great value was added to a rich collection previously ob tained from\
        \ Professor Hayden, of the United States Exploring Expedition, through the\
        \ agency of Rush Taggart, Esq. By courses of lectures delivered during several\

        \ with which a very handsome telescope was obtained from the celebrated manufactur\

        clergyman and author, son of Thomas Allen, born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts,
        January 2, 1784, died in Northampton, July 16, 1868. He graduated at Harvard
        College in 1802, and studied theology with the Rev. Doctor Pierce, of Brookline.
        After being licensed in 1804 by the Berkshire Association, he preached for
        some months in various parts of AVestern New York. Upon his return he was
        appointed a regent of Harvard College, and was also assistant librarian of
        the college. During this period he prepared the first edition of his " American
        Biographical and Historical Dictionary " (1809), containing notices of about
        seven hundred Americans. This was the first book of general biography issued
        in the United States. In 1807 he prepared the bio graphical sketches of American
        ministers for the Reverend David Bogue''s and Bennett''s " History of Dissenters,"
        published in London in four volumes. The second edition of his dictionary
        appeared in 1832, and contained more than 1,800 names. The third edition,
        published in Boston in 1857, contains biographies and notices of nearly 7,000
        Americans. His connection with the uni versity ceased in 1810, when he was
        ordained pastor of the Congrega tional Church in Pittstield, as his father''s
        successor. The legislature of New Hampshire in 1816 altered thc charter of
        Dartmouth CoUege, and created in its stead a university, of which Doctor Allen
        was made president in 1817. Upon an appeal to the Supreme Court at Washington,
        the rights of the college against the State were maintained in 1819. In 1820,
        Doctor Allen was appointed president of Bowdoin College, Maine, and retained
        that position till 1839, when he resigned it, and retired to Northampton,
        Massachu- setts, engaging in various literary labors. Among these is a collection
        of more than 10,000 words not found in dictionaries of the English language;
        nearly 1,500 being contributed to Worcester''s Dictionary (1846), more than
        4,000 to AVebster''s (1854), and about 6,000 to the new edition of AVebster.
        His other chief writings are, "Junius Unmasked," to prove that Lord Saekville
        was the real Junius ; " Ac counts of Shipwrecks"; "Psalms and Hymns," with
        many original hymns (1835) ; " Memoirs of Doctor Eleazar Wheelock and of Doc
        tor John Codman " (1853) ; " AVunnisoo ; or, The Vale of Hoosatun nuk," a

        however, in 1868, George L. Goodale, a graduate of Amherst in 1860, was elected.
        In 1862, AVilliam P. Tucker, class of 1854, tutor since 1857, was instructor
        in mathematics for one year. He had, in the mean time, as librarian, prepared
        an elaborate and valuable catalogue of the college library. In 1865, Edward
        N. Packard, tutor since 1863, was instruc tor, and in 1866 Adjunct Professor
        of Mathematics. The death of Professor Smyth in 1868, while intensely engaged
        upon the building of Memorial HaU, left the Chair of Mathematics and Natural
        Philosophy vacant, and Charles E. Rockwood, a graduate of Yale, was chosen
        to the place. In 1864, Professor E. C. Smyth resigned the Chair of Natural
        and Revealed Religion, and was succeeded by Professor Alpheus S. Pack ard,
        who was transferred from the Chair of Ancient Languages, to which, in 1865,
        Reverend J otham B. Sewall, class of 1848, tutor in 1851, was chosen. In 1871,
        Henry L. Chapman was chosen Adjunct Professor of Latin, and in 1872 a full
        professor. In 1865 the alumni of the college voted to erect a building to
        be called Memorial Hall, in honor of the graduates aud students of the college
        who had died in the civil war. A subscription was at once started to carry
        the plan into execution, and a committee was raised for the purpose. A sufficient
        amount of funds was raised to warrant the prosecution of the work, and the
        corner-stone was accordingly laid in 1866. The outside of the building has
        since been completed, but enough funds have not yet been secured to enable
        it to be finished inside. When more prosperous times return, there is scarcely
        a doubt but that the original intention will be carried out. President AVoods
        resigning in 1866, Reverend Samuel Harris, S. T. D., a graduate of 1833, was
        elected to his place in 1867. He took upon himself, also, the duties of the
        Professor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics, Professor Upham being that
        year honored with the Emeritus title. In 1871 the eminent scholar, civilian,
        and general, Ex-Governor Chamberlain, was chosen to succeed President Harris,
        and at this time quite a reorganization of the college occurred. A scientific
        depart ment was established and several new chairs of instruction were sounded.
        George L. Arose, C. E., was elected Professor of Civil En gineering; Edward
        S. Morse, Ph. D., of Salem, Professor of Compar ative Anatomy and Zoology
        ; Mr. James B. Taylor, Provisional Pro fessor of Elocution and Oratory ; the

        He added an elaborate Corinthian portico to the noble old church, and greatly
        desired to pull the ancient building down altogether, so that we have a debt
        of gratitude to some unknown friend for preserving the Abbey, and staying
        Sir Christopher. Now, it must always be recorded to the honour of Vanbrugh,
        that he tried to preserve the old palace of Woodstock, or, at least, the marvellous

        much to say that nearly every person in England has access to one of them,
        and if his taste lies in reading travels or adventures, he will not do amiss
        if he searches a catalogue for those of the beginning of the present century
        or the end of the last. If it comes to reading Camden or Froissart, we expect
        to find things very different from scenes we are familiar with. But when we

        blows to its prosperity, from which it has never recovered, although the completion
        of the Davenport k St. Paul Railroad, in 1872, was of some advantage to it,
        more, perhaps, by aiding it to hold the county seat than in any other way.
        December, 1854, the County Judge ordered, inasmuch as over one-fourth of the
        voters of Delhi had petitioned to have the town incorporated, that an elec
        tion be held January 15, 1855, to decide the question, and appointed William
        F. Tanner, William Phillips and George Shelden, Judges, and C. W. Hobbs and
        S. F. Parker, Clerks of the election. Thirty-seven votes were cast for the
        measure, and none against. The Judge then appointed January 27, 1855, as the
        day on which the citizens were to select five persons to prepare a charter
        for the government of the town; and on that day, A. K. Eaton, James Wright,
        E. K. Griffin, Daniel Baker and Samuel F. Parker were elected. Jud^e Ben son
        ordered the charter, as prepared, to be submitted February 28, which was accepted
        by a unanimous vote of twenty-eight. The charter provided for elect ing town
        officers on the second Monday in March following, concerning which the county
        records are silent, but tradition states that A. K. Eaton was the first Mayor,
        and S. G. Van Anda the second. In the latter''s term of office, the corporate
        powers were allowed to lapse into disuse, and have ever since remained dormant.
        In 1856, William Sylvester, Elisha Brady and Skerry built a steam saw and
        flouring-mill near the northwest corner of the lake, on the northeast quarter
        of the northeast quarter of Section 20, Town 88 north, Range 4 west, a short
        distance south of the plat of Delhi. It was a substantial stone build ing.
        In 1861, the mill suspended operations, and in 1862, the building was converted
        into a distillery by George Maxwell, who continued until 1866, when Col. J.
        H. Peters operated it until 1867. Since that time, the old mill has been unoccupied,
        and is becoming dilapidated. July 4, 1861, was celebrated by Delhi in ample
        form. The parade included a dozen veterans of the war of 1812. Speeches were
        made by J. H. Peters, S. G. Van Anda and others. The celebration was kept
        up till late in the after noon, when a dance began at the Harding House, and
        was kept up till sunrise next morning. A Farmers'' Club was organized in Delhi
        in May, 1866, with the following officers : Washington J. Graham, President
        ; Samuel Allison, Jr., Vice Presi dent ; William Ball, Secretary ; Daniel
        Smith, Treasurer ; and John Porter Corresponding Secretary. A Literary and
        Library Association was organized at Delhi, May 29, 1871. Dr. Albert Boomer
        was elected President ; Mrs. J. H. Peters, Vice President ; Thomas A. Twiss,
        Secretary ; J. M. Noble, Treasurer ; Mrs. D. Louise Ingalls, Librarian. Membership
        fee was fixed at $4.00, payable quarterly. Quite a sum was raised for books,
        but the books were never purchased. EDUCATIONAL. Previous to independent organization,
        Delhi was attached to Sub-district No. 4. The independent school district
        of Delhi was organized August 18, 1863. The Judges of Election were Charles
        Thorpe, N. Dunham, K. W. Kingsley, J. Y. Atchison and J. L. McCreery. The
        officers first elected were W. M. Hartshorn, President ; E. Graham, Vice President
        ; E. Brady, Secre tary ; Z. D. Scobey, Treasurer. The first school in Delhi
        was held in the old log Court House. It commenced in the Summer of 1846, Roxana
        Brown, teacher ; and this was the school house until the first school house
        was built,', 1]
    - ['467 HISTORY OF DELAWARE COUNTY. In July, Rev. James D. Mason was chosen President,
        his pay to be the receipts for tuition. October 8, the Synod changed the name
        to "Lenox Collegiate Institute," which action was ratified by the Trustees
        the same day. This act revived to a certain extent the feeling created in
        the Allen difficulty, and both Synod and Trustees were blamed for dropping
        the name that had been formally accepted and paid for when it was a question
        whether the school could be established or not. The Synod passed the following:
        Reiolved, That we recommend Lenox Collegiate Institute to the churches as
        worthy of their patronage, and recommend it to their liberality in any effort
        which the Trustees may make to render the Institution permanent, by procuring
        apparatus and an endowment. Resolved, That we also recommend the Board of
        Trustees to the favor of the Board of Educa tion in order to procure assistance
        in endowing the Institution from Eastern churches. Rev. Mr. Mason resigned
        his place, from pique toward some of the students, who claimed they could
        make no progress, owing to his want of attention, and Rev. Mr. Allen was again
        placed in charge, not without stirring up the old feud, for June 27, 1865,
        the students petitioned the Trustees not to remove him. Samuel Calvin, now
        Professor of Natural Sciences in the State University, was chosen Professor
        of Mathematics during this term, and Rev. Mr. Hodge had already been given
        the chair of Languages. The Minervian Society appears to have been organized
        in 1865. The offi cers in March, 1866, were Lu. L. Diffenderfer, President;
        Amanda Marshall, Vice President ; Belle Douglass, Recording Secretary ; Ella
        J. Dunlap, Corre sponding Secretary ; Mary A. Carl, Librarian ; Mattie C.
        Smith, Mary E. Slemmons, Anna M. Snyder, Directresses. Among the members were
        Julia Loomis, Sarah B. Scobey and Mattie A. Jackson. The Minervians gave an
        exhibition March 13, 1867, and Rev. L. B. Fifield delivered an address before
        the Society on the previous evening. The Society has now been dormant for
        several years. In October, 1865, it was reported to the Synod that the Board
        of Education had contributed $300 toward the maintenance of the school the
        past year. Prof. Allen resigned the charge of the school in June, 1866, and
        in the fol lowing October, Rev. Samuel Hodge was chosen President, who held
        the posi tion until May 30, 1870, when Rev. J. W. Hanna succeeded him. October
        31, 1870, at a joint meeting of the Trustees with the people of Hopkinton,
        $3,000 was pledged toward endowing the President''s chair, and John Kennedy,
        Esq., was appointed by the Trustees to canvass the county to increase the
        amount. The endowment now amounts to over $18,000, the largest contributors
        to which have been Converse Clark, of New York, who bequeathed $9,000 in real
        estate ; Mrs. Mary G. Semple, Pittsburgh, $3,000 in bonds, and James Lenox,
        of New York, $1,000. The deed transferring the property to the Synod is dated
        February 9, 1864, and is made by Henry A. and Mary A. Carter. The grantees
        on behalf of the Synod are E. L. Doddes, Myron H. Beach, James Kilpatrick,
        Leroy Jackson, Henry A. Carter, James L. Wilson and Fergus S. McKean. The
        articles of incorporation were not perfected until September 12, 1873. The
        Trustees named therein are J. S. Wilson, A. S. Marshall, W. R. Marshall, John
        McKean, S. Hodge, D. Russell, W. W. Thorpe, Rev. J. S. Cowden, A. B. Goodale,
        William Flude, P. Melendy, George Ordway, W. G. Donnan. H. A. Carter and L.
        Jackson. The growth of the school from 1870 onward made an addition to the
        build ing necessary, which was provided in 1875 by the erection of a wing
        at the east end, which is 30x55 feet, two stories high, and cost $4,500, making

        \ of oak, covered with black leather. The entire building contains three lineal\
        \ miles of bookcases and twenty-five miles of shelving, and the whole Library\
        \ now contains very nearly one million volumes. The decoration of the interior\
        \ of the dome pre sents a judicious and effective mingling of light colours\
        \ and gilding; and the entire structure, which cost \xA3150,000, reflects\
        \ great credit upon Sir Antonio Panizzi, the former principal librarian, who\
        \ designed it, and upon Mr. Sydney Smirke, the architect under whose directions\
        \ the details were worked out. The internal ar rangements and the general\
        \ administration are most efficient; and it is both a pleasure and a duty\
        \ to acknowledge in these pages the great convenience afforded to literary\
        \ men by this national library, and especially the promptitude, the courtesy,\
        \ and the invaluable assistance ren dered by its officials, from the highest\
        \ to the lowest. The Great Exhibition of 1851 had proved a great stimulus\
        \ to commerce and to the general intercourse of nations; and a similar scheme\
        \ had been carried out at Paris, in 1855, with much success. This was an Exhibition\
        \ of works of art as well as of works of industry and utility, and it did\
        \ much for the cultivation of the public taste. A resolve was taken by a number\
        \ of leading and public-spirited residents in Man chester to hold an Exhibition\
        \ of Art Treasures, drawn from all parts of the United Kingdom, with a view\
        \ to show its resources in painting and statuary, aud in articles of vertu\
        \ and adorn ment. An ample guarantee fund was secured ; and a suitable building\
        \ erected at Old Trafford, one of the suburbs of Manchester. The appeal of\
        \ the promoters met with a cordial response. The queen permitted a selection\
        \ to be made from the royal galleries and collections of all such works as\
        \ suited the design; and private owners of rare and costly articles readily\
        \ contri buted to such an extent that the estimated money value of tbe whole\
        \ was upwards of six millions. The contributions were grouped into seven sec\
        \ tions, embracing Paintings by Ancient Masters; Paintings by Modern Masters;\
        \ British Portrait Gallery; Sculpture; Museum of Ornamental Art; Water-Colour\
        \ Drawings; and Historical Miniatures. This unparalleled assemblage of curious\
        \ and costly articles was opened by the Prince Consort, in May, 1857, and\
        \ continued to be visited daily by thousands of persons from all parts of\
        \ the kingdom and from the Continent until October, when it was finally dispersed\
        \ without injury. The first meeting of the \" National Associa tion for the\
        \ Promotion of Social Science\" was held at Birmingham in October, 1857, under\
        \ the presidency of Lord Brougham. The objects sought to be attained in its\
        \ formation are thus expressed: \u2014 \"To aid the development of the social\
        \ sciences, and to guide the public mind to the best practical means of promoting\
        \ the Amendment of the Law, the Advancement of Education, the Prevention and\
        \ Repression of Crime, the Reformation of Criminals, the Es tablishment of\
        \ due Sanitary Regulations, and the recognition of sound principles in all\
        \ ques tions of Social Economy.\" Early in .lune, 1857, the country was startled\
        \ by intelligence of a formidable mutiny among the troops of the native Bengal\
        \ army. This excited profound anxiety and alarm, although the full importance\
        \ of the calamity and the im minent danger which menaced the Indian pos sessions\
        \ were not at first adequately realized. Perhaps it is not too much to affirm\
        \ that by the bulk of the nation this was not done until after tbe mutiny\
        \ had been quelled, and then the actual peril which had been so narrowly avoided\
        \ became most apparent. The new Reading Room at the British Museum was opened\
        \ in May, 1857. It forms a circular building, one hundred and forty feet in\
        \ dia meter; surmounted by a dome, one hundred and six feet high. Accommodation\
        \ is afforded for three hundred readers; the tables radiating from the central\
        \ desks occupied by the officers. Shelves are ranged around the room to a\
        \ height of twenty-four feet, containing eighty thousand volumes, which are\
        \ reached by means of two light galleries. The shelves are formed The nature\
        \ of the English hold upon India was so anomalous, that the reflective had\
        \ constantly doubted its permanence. Our con quests had been largely effected\
        \ by native armies, and continued to be ruled by their in strumentality; but\
        \ it was unreasonable to think that the military allegiance of the Sepoy would",

        God, who never worked a miracle to confirm any re ligious belies but that
        of the Holy Catholic Church, was unwilling that a miracle already worked should
        subsist, when the remains had fallen into the hands of schismatics." In other
        words, the instant the Rev. James Raine, the heretical librarian of Durham
        Cathedral, in company with two prebendaries, and three officials of the chapter,
        approached the vault with a view to look in on its mysteries, the hitherto
        incorruptible body vanished away, leaving only the bare bones to greet their
        profane eyes. This, therefore, is the last of St. Cuthbert''s miracles : in
        which comfortable belief one would fancy the most gracious task the good Benedictines
        could perform would be to inscribe over the tomb their REQUIESCAT IN PACE,
        and let the saint have peace at last. As to St. Margaret, she too had her
        full share of the unrest which pertains to the honours of a fertory and saintly
        shrine. One famous removal specially attracts our notice by its miraculous
        evidence of the virtues of the loving wife strangely surviving those of the
        ascetic martyr. The royal husband''s remains, which had been originally buried
        at Tynemouth, were afterwards brought to Dun fermline ; and when, in 1250,
        St. Margaret''s canonised bones were translated to a shrine decorated with
        gold and jewels, in the new ly', 1]

        \ Library Opened : Constitution Hill. Lending Libraries, with News Rooms attached.\"\
        \ The District Libraries, the Committee proposed, should be situated as nearly\
        \ as possible as follows : \u2014 \" That for the northern district, near\
        \ St. George's Church ; for the southern district, in the vicinity of Bradford\
        \ Street ; for the eastern district, near Gosta Green ; for the central and\
        \ western district, near the Town Hall.\" The cost of establishing the District\
        \ Libraries (including 3,000 books for each) and of maintaining them for one\
        \ year, was estimated at \xA3813 each; or a total cost of \xA33,252. The annual\
        \ cost of each Library after the first year was estimated at \xA3240 for administration,\
        \ rent, news rooms, &c. ; \xA3100 for books, and \xA330 for binding ; total,\
        \ \xA3370, or a grand total for the four of \xA31,480. This report was approved\
        \ by the Council, and the Committee were authorised to carry its recommendations\
        \ into effect. The first Library proceeded with was that for the northern\
        \ district, \"for which a suitable building was obtained in Constitution Hill,\
        \ from Mr. Cartland, at a rent of \xA345 a year. About \xA3300 were spent\
        \ in altering and fitting up the rooms, and for another \xA3300 the Committee\
        \ acquired 6,500 volumes of standard literature (the stock of the Birmingham\
        \ New Library, formerly in Temple Eow West, which was then amalgamated with\
        \ the Birmingham Old Library, in Union Street). Mr. Edward Lings, of the Salford\
        \ Free Library, was appointed Librarian, at a salary of \xA375 a year, \"\
        \ together with residence, fire, and light.\" On the 3rd of April, 1861, the\
        \ Constitution Hill Library was formally opened by Mr. Arthur Eyland, then\
        \ Mayor. There was a simple, but dignified and impressive ceremony at the\
        \ opening. Mr. Eyland entertained the Council, magistrates, public officials,\
        \ clergy and ministers, and other principal citizens, to the number of three\
        \ hundred, at breakfast at Dee's Hotel. Thence they walked in procession to\
        \ the Library in Constitution Hill. Arrived there, speeches were made by the\
        \ Mayor, Mr. George Dawson, the Eev. Canon Miller, and some others, and then\
        \ the building was declared open, amidst the cheers of the assembly, taken\
        \ up and repeated by a vast crowd which had gathered outside. The first issues\
        \ of books took place on the 22nd of April. \" Crowds of persons \" (say the\
        \ Committee in their report for 1861) \" presented themselves for tickets,\
        \ and so great was the excitement that for several weeks applicants had to\

    - ["211 FREE LIBRARIES. builders. The Committee had been alarmed by the excess\
        \ of cost on Mr. Barry's plans. The smallness of the tenders on Mr. Martin's\
        \ plans now excited a similar feeling, lest the building should not be strong\
        \ enough. So the plans were submitted to Mr. Philip Hardwicke, who substantially\
        \ confirmed them. Finally, in October, 1862, the tender of Messrs. Branson\
        \ and Murray was accepted, for \xA38,600, with some additions for improvements\
        \ suggested by Mr. Hardwicke. Owing to a strike amongst the stonemasons, the\
        \ progress of the building was much delayed. The Central Lending Library and\
        \ the Art Gallery were opened on the 6th of September, 1865, on the occasion\
        \ of the meeting of the British Association in Birmingham. The Mayor, Mr.\
        \ H. Wiggin, gave a breakfast at the Eoyal Hotel, and the company afterwards\
        \ adjourned to the Library, when prayers were offered by the Bishop of Worcester,\
        \ and speeches were made by the Mayor, Lord Stanley (the present Earl of Derby),\
        \ the Eev. Dr. Miller, and Mr. George Dawson. The first issue of books was\
        \ made on the 19th of September, the rooms having, in the interval, been used\
        \ by the British Association. The Central Eeference Library was not opened\
        \ until about twelve months later, on the 26th of October, 1866, Mr. Edwin\
        \ Yates being then Mayor. The interval had been well employed in the selection\
        \ of books. This work was entrusted mainly to Mr. Samuel Timmiiis, Mr. Jacob\
        \ Bhillips (then Chairman of the Committee), and Mr. J. D. Mullins, who was\
        \ appointed Chief Librarian on the 30th of May, 1865, at a salary of \xA3\
        200 a year. This selection was made on the following principles, laid down\
        \ by the Committee, and approved by the Council : \u2014 \" I. That the Library\
        \ should, as far as practicable, represent every phase of human thought, and\
        \ every variety of opinion. II. That books of permanent value and of standard\
        \ interest should form the principal portion of the Library, and that modern\
        \ and popular books should be added from time to time, as they are published.\
        \ III. That the Library should contain those rare and costly works which are\
        \ generally out of the reach of individual students and collectors, and which\
        \ are not usually found in provincial or private libraries.\" Acting on these\
        \ principles, the Committee purchased and placed on the shelves before the\
        \ day of opening a collection of 16,195 volumes, ranging over the whole field\
        \ of literature, ancient and Chap. VIII. Section 1. New Plans Adopted. Opening\

        \ gratitude, as he sits in this room, may for a moment call to mind the names\
        \ of the men who, by speech and by labour, by the necessary agitation or the\
        \ continuous work, took part in founding this Library. There are few places\
        \ I would rather haunt after my death than this room, and there are few things\
        \ I would have my children remember more than this : that this man spoke the\
        \ discourse at the opening of this glorious Library, the first-fruits of a\
        \ clear understanding that a great town exists to discharge towards the people\
        \ of that town the duties that a great nation exists to discharge towards\
        \ the people of that nation ; that a town exists here by the grace of God\
        \ ; that a great town is a solemn organism through which should flow, and\
        \ in which should be shaped, all the highest, loftiest, and truest ends of\
        \ man's intel lectual and moral nature. I wish, then, for you, Mr. Mayor,\
        \ and for myself, that, in years to come, when we are in some respects forgotten,\
        \ still now and then, in this room, the curious questions may be asked : Who\
        \ -was Mayor on that famous day ? Who said grace before that famous banquet\
        \ ? Who returned thanks for that gracious meal ? Who gathered these books\
        \ together ? Who was the first man that held that new office of librarian\
        \ ? I trust his name will be printed whenever the name of this Corporation\
        \ appears. What his title is to be I don't know \u2014 whether it is to be\
        \ Town Librarian or Corporation Librarian \u2014 but I envy him whatever it\
        \ may be ; and I am glad the Corporation has given itself an officer who represents\
        \ intellect, that it looks upwards deliberately and says, ' We are the Corporation\
        \ who have undertaken the highest duty that is possible to us ; we have made\
        \ provision for our people \u2014 for all our people \u2014 and we have made\
        \ a provision of God's greatest and best gifts unto man.' \" An addition of\
        \ special interest was made to the Library two years after its opening. This\
        \ consisted of the Shakespeare Memorial Library. The project of establishing\
        \ a Shakespeare Library in the capital of the Midlands, the chief town of\
        \ Shake speare's own county, had been broached by Mr. Samuel Timmins, an ardent\
        \ Shakespearean (and editor of one of the first reprints \u2014 the Devonshire\

        \ great risk, and deposited in the gateway of the Mason College and the corridors\

        \ and within a quarter of an hour of its discovery its progress was beyond\
        \ control, and nearly the whole of the Eeference Library had been destroyed.\
        \ Collections Destroyed. \" Your Committee regret to report the almost total\

        \ William Bragge ; and that the great collection of Birmingham books, to which\
        \ the Librarian had given his special attention for several years, is practically\
        \ lost.\" One thing helped to mitigate the distress caused by the calamity\
        \ above described \u2014 namely, the admirable spirit in which it was borne\
        \ by the town. Every citizen felt that he had sustained a personal loss ;\
        \ everyone concurred in the measures immediately taken for the restoration\
        \ of the Libraries ; and a large number contributed liberally towards the\
        \ funds required for this purpose. The Free Libraries Committee themselves\
        \ lost no time. They met on the Monday after the fire, and their first business\
        \ was to pass a resolution declaring it to be a public duty at once to repair\
        \ the loss, and asking for a subscription of not less than \xA310,000 in aid\
        \ of the insurance fund. At the same meeting the Committee instructed a sub-committee\
        \ to confer with their architects, Messrs. Martin and Chamberlain, as to the\
        \ preparation of plans for a new building. The Mayor (Alderman Collings),\
        \ at the request of the Committee, called a public meeting of persons willing\
        \ to contribute to the restoration fund. This meeting, which was very largely\
        \ attended, was held on the 17th of Jauuary. A statement read by Alderman\
        \ Barrow, the Chairman of the Committee, gave the key-note to the proceedings\
        \ : \" \"Under the most lamentable disaster (it said) that has befallen the\
        \ town, the Committee felt that the first thought of the community would be\
        \ to restore a Library which has conferred such priceless blessings upon thousands\

        \ on the liberal scale above mentioned, but the greatest sympathy was expressed\
        \ throughout the country, and in literary circles abroad, and many valuable\
        \ gifts of books were received towards the restoration of the Library. A list\
        \ of these donations, complete to its date, will be found in an appendix to\
        \ the report of the Libraries Committee for 1878 and 1879. It must suffice\
        \ to say here that first amongst the donors was Her Majesty the Queen, who\

        \ estimated at \xA332,000, being \xA310,000 above the amount previously sanctioned\
        \ by the Council. On the completion of the buildings, the total cost, including\
        \ fittings, architects' commisssion, and all other expenses, was ascertained\
        \ to be \xA354,975. The final accounts of the building were rendered in a\
        \ report of the Committee, presented to the Council on the 17th of July, 1883.\
        \ The cost was there stated as follows : \u2014 Buildings, \xA336,392 ; sittings,\
        \ \xA313,383 ; decoration (designed throughout by Mr. John Henry Chamberlain),\
        \ \xA3800 ; miscellaneous expenses, consisting of insurance, work done in\

        \ \xA3931 ; stipend of clerk of the works, \xA3400 ; architects' commission.\
        \ \xA33,068 ; total, \xA354,975. The excess of the architects' commission\
        \ over the customary five per cent, was explained by the fact that the architects\
        \ had prepared several sets of plans for the alteration and extension of the\
        \ previously existing Reference Library, and for these an allowance of \xA3\
        493 was made, which, together with the commission of five per cent, on the\
        \ buildings executed, makes up the remuneration above stated. The new Reference\
        \ and Lending Libraries, together with the News Room, in Ratcliff Place, were\
        \ opened on Thursday, the lst of June, 1882, under the mayoralty of Alderman\

        Libraries Eestoration Fund be, and they are, hereby presented to the Officers
        and Committee for their zealous and most successful efforts." This motion

        of the Committee and the Treasurer (Mr. Jaffray), and of himself and Mr. Bunce,

        by way of a covered gallery across Eatcbff Blace, to the new Library. There
        a brief and simple ceremony took place. Standing at the upper end of the Eeference
        Library, the Mayor and Mr. Bright, followed by other visitors of note, entered
        their names in the Visitors'' Book, and Councillor Johnson, the Chairman of
        the Libraries Committee, then handed to the Mayor the catalogue of the Library,
        and invited His Worship, " as the first burgess of the Borough," to take out
        the first book. The Mayor, in response, said that, " he begged to call for
        a book, than which, he thought, in the county of Warwick, on such an occasion,
        a more fitting one could not be called for. He called for the first folio
        edition of Shakespeare''s Plays, as the first book to be issued from the new
        Eeference Library." Mr. J. D. Mullins, the Chief Librarian, having handed
        the first folio to the Mayor, His Worship declared the Library open, expressing
        a hope that, " as it was a palace of beauty, so might it also be a temple
        of wisdom, virtue, learning, and goodness, being so used that it might be
        for the everlasting advantage of the people of that great town, and might

        Sir Henry Parkes, Prime Minister of New South Wales (formerly a Birmingham
        man) ; and Mr. E. B. Nicholson, of the Bodleian Library. With the commencement
        of the new buildings the work of reconstructing the Library was at once taken
        in hand. This duty was entrusted to the Management Sub-committee, who appointed
        a Book Committee, consisting of Alderman Collings (then Chairman of the Libraries
        Committee), Alderman Barrow, Mr. Samuel Timmins, Mr. John Thackray Bunce,
        and Mr. Edmund Tonks. On the retirement of Mr. Collings from the chairmanship,
        his place on the Book Committee was taken by the new Chairman, Mr. George
        James Johnson ; and by the gentlemen above named (greatly assisted by the
        skill and practical knowledge of Mr. J. D. Mullins, the chief librarian),
        the collection of books now (end of 1884) deposited in the Eeference Library,
        amounting to 73,600 volumes, was made. The principles upon which the Book
        Committee worked were stated in a memorandum published in the report for 1878-9.
        This document laid down as the chief lines of purchase (guided by the advice
        of experts in various departments) the acquisition of a collection representing
        all phases of thought and opinion ; books of permanent interest and standard
        rank ; rare and costly works out of the reach of students and private collectors
        ; a bibliographical section, as complete as could possibly be made ; special
        collections relating to Shakespearean literature ; and local books, illustrating
        the history, industries, and progress of the town and the county. The biennial
        Report of the Libraries Committee for 1883 and 1884 gives a record of continued
        progress for those years. In 1883, by the passing of the Consolidation Act,
        the limit of the Library Rate to one penny in the pound was removed ; a much
        needed relief to the finances of the Library. Many valuable gifts were made
        to the Library in 1883, including a number of books for the formation of a
        Milton Library, by Mr. Frank Wright. The Cervantes Collection was also considerably
        renewed ; and the Committee report that the Shakespeare Library had now "

        of daily at tendance, have mentioned to me that they often find them selves
        in divisions they have not before visited. Fancy a Parisian panorama passage,
        fancy perhaps a square mile covered with these arcades, intersecting each
        other in all directions, and fuU of every product of the empire, from diamonds
        to dates. This wiU give you some idea of the Great Bazaar at Constantinople.
        The dealers, in every possible costume, sit cross-legged in their stalls,
        and dealers in the same article usually congregate together. The armourers,
        the grocers, the pipe-makers, the jewellers, the shawl-sellers, the librarians,
        all have their distinct quarter. Now you walk along a range of stalls filled
        with fanciful slippers of cloth and leather, of all colours, embroidered with
        gold or powdered with pearls ; now you are in a street of confectionery ;
        and now you are cheapening a Damascus sabre in the bazaar of arms, or turning
        over a vividly Ulu minated copy of Hafiz in that last stronghold of Turkish
        bigotry, the quarter of the vendors of the Koran. The magnificence, novelty,
        and variety of the goods on sale, the whole nation of shopkeepers, all in
        different dress, the crowds of buyers from all parts of the world, I only
        hint at these traits. Here every people has a characteristic cos tume. Turks,
        Greeks, Jews, and Armenians are the staple population : the latter are numerous.
        The Armenians wear round and very unbecoming black caps and flowing robes
        ; the Jews, a black hat wreathed with a white handkerchief; the Greeks, black
        turbans. The Turks are fond of dress, and indulge in all combinations of costume.
        Of late, among the young men in the capital, it has been the fashion to discard
        the huge turban and the ample robes, and they have formed an exceedingly ungraceful
        dress upon the Frank; but vast numbers cling to the national costume, especially
        the Asiatics, renowned for the prodigious height &nd multifarious folds of
        their head-gear.', 1]

        \ could not be delivered. \"The Term closed; and by cunning that might have\
        \ shamed an Alsatian scrivener, though practised by an anointed king, the\
        \ defendants had to lie in prison through the long vacation before even another\
        \ chance could present itself for bail.\" The subsequent history of Sir John\
        \ Eliot possesses all the interest of a romance. It is not'exceeded, in the\
        \ development of high prin ciple and heroic fortitude, by any tale in ancient\
        \ or modern times. He had evidently contem plated from the commencement of\
        \ this reign, the probability of such a termination of his patriotic life.\
        \ He had read the character of Charles from the first, and knew that there\
        \ was neither generosity nor justice in his heart. Laud he had uniformly opposed,\
        \ as the despoiler of religion and the enemy of his country; and the pseudo-patriotism\
        \ of Wentworth had always been regarded by him with more than suspicion. From\
        \ such a monarch , aided by such coun sellors, Eliot had nothing to expect.\
        \ Yet he spurned, with virtuous indignation, the freedom which was proffered\
        \ him on condition of his tendering an acknowledgment of guilt. He was removed\
        \ from one apartment of the Tower to another, and the rigour of his imprisonment\
        \ was steadily increased. Eliot had filed his demurrer in the Star Chamber\
        \ Court, where the usual tedious and vexatious processes were going on, but\
        \ nothing came of it. \"Close\" confinement, however, was now changed for\
        \ \"safe\" confinement, which gave the liberty of the Tower and the means\
        \ of correspondence. This change arose in some measure from the popular outcry,\
        \ but in a larger measure from motives of economy; \"close\" prisoners being\
        \ kept at the royal charges, while \"safe\" prisoners had to pro vide for\
        \ themselves. Two of the number now made submission and were allowed to depart;\
        \ but the seven remained in durance, unable to take any legal steps until\
        \ the next Term. Pending this, a squib was being secretly circulated, entitled,\
        \ \u2014 \"A Proposition for his Majesty's Service to bridle the Impertinency\
        \ of Parliaments,\" in which the sovereign was re commended with grave irony\
        \ to abolish them outright as Louis the Eleventh had done, to substitute his\
        \ own authority everywhere in place of law, and to raise money by a series\
        \ of suggested absolute edicts. At length it came to the royal ears, and copies\
        \ having been traced to Selden, St. John, and others, prosecutions were commenced\
        \ in the Star Chamber, and as the tract was alleged to have come originally\
        \ out of the library of Sir Robert Cotton, the library was put under seizure\
        \ and closed; its learned owner was imprisoned by order of the Council; and\
        \ the same fate was inflicted on his librarian Richard James. These iniquitous\
        \ things were done at the opening of Michaelmas term; they were persisted\
        \ in for many months; the court covered itself in the process with ridi cule\
        \ and shame; and at last was too glad to accept the excuse of the birth of\
        \ a Prince of Wales to direct a pardon to every one impli cated. This was\
        \ at the close of May, 1630; and in the same month of the following year Sir\
        \ Robert Cotton died. D'Ewes says iii his Autography, \u2014 \" He was frequently\
        \ thereupon sued in the Star-Chamber, his library locked up from his use,\
        \ and two or more of the guard set to watch his house continually. When I\
        \ went several times to visit and comfort him in the year 1630, he would tell\
        \ me they had broken his heart that had locked up his library Sir John Eliot\
        \ employed himself in the Tower in writing to his numerous friends, ad vising\
        \ them as to the course to be pursued under the political circumstances; in\
        \ the manage ment of his family property, which for the sake of security he\
        \ had previously vested in trustees for the benefit of his children, now motherless;\
        \ in planning the education of his sons ; and in the composition of a manuscript\
        \ treatise on government, now among the papers at Port Eliot. Michaelmas Term\
        \ was drawing near ; and the judges were sent for to be pri vately consulted\
        \ as before, the result being that the proceedings in the Star Chamber were\
        \ dropped, and informations were filed in the King's Bench against Eliot,\
        \ Holies, and Valen tine. The judges further sought to overcome their own\
        \ scruples and to meet the legal diffi culties by suggesting that the prisoners\
        \ might be bailed, \"giving security for their good behaviour ; \" a loose\
        \ term that was susceptible of almost any construction being* forced upon\
        \ it. To be bound to good behaviour in the charges at issue, was to be bound\
        \ to desert the public cause; to be bound not again to bear arms against the\
        \ enemies ; to be bound to declare freedom of conduct and of speech in Parliament\
        \ to be matter of favour, not of right. On Saturday the third of October,\
        \ seven months after the illegal arrest, all the seven prisoners were brought\

        \ as nearly as possible as follows : \u2014 \" That for the northern district,\
        \ near St. George's Church ; for the southern district, in the vicinity of\
        \ Bradford Street ; for the eastern district, near Gosta Green ; for the central\
        \ and western district, near the Town Hall.\" The cost of establishing the\
        \ District Libraries (including 3,000 books for each) and of maintaining them\
        \ for one year, was estimated at \xA3813 each; or a total cost of \xA33,252.\
        \ Tbe annual cost of each Library after the first year was estimated at \xA3\
        240 for administration, rent, news rooms, &c. ; \xA3100 for books, and \xA3\
        30 for binding ; total, \xA3370, or a grand total for the four of \xA31,480.\
        \ This report was approved by the Council, and the Committee were authorised\
        \ to carry its recommendations into effect. The first Library proceeded with\
        \ was that for the northern district, for w-hich a suitable building was obtained\
        \ in Constitution Hill, from Mr. Cartland, at a rent of \xA345 a year. About\
        \ \xA3300 were spent in altering and fitting up the rooms, and for another\
        \ \xA3300 the Committee acquired 6,500 volumes of standard literature (the\
        \ stock of the Birmingham New Library, formerly in Temple Row West, which\
        \ was then amalgamated with the Birmingham Old Library, in Union Street).\
        \ Mr. Edward Lings, of the Salford Free Library, was appointed Librarian,\
        \ at a salary of \xA375 a yrear, \" together with residence, fire, and light.\"\
        \ On the 3rd of April, 1861, the Constitution Hill Library was formally opened\
        \ by Mr. Arthur Ryland, then Mayor. There was a simple, but dignified and\
        \ impressive ceremony at the opening. Mr. Ryland entertained the Council,\
        \ magistrates, public officials, clergy and ministers, and other principal\
        \ citizens, to the number of three hundred, at breakfast at Dee's Hotel. Thence\
        \ they walked in procession to the Library in Constitution Hill. Arrived there,\
        \ speeches were made by the Mayor, Mr. George Dawson, the Rev. Canon Miller,\
        \ and some others, and then the building was declared open, amidst the cheers\
        \ of the assembly, taken up and repeated by a vast crowd which had gathered\
        \ outside. The first issues of books took place on the 22nd of April. \" Crowds\
        \ of persons \" (say the Committee in their report for 1861) \" presented\
        \ themselves for tickets, and so great was the excitement that for several\
        \ weeks applicants had to 14", 1]

        \ of cost on Mr. Barry's plans. The smallness of the tenders on Mr. Martin's\
        \ plans now excited a similar feeling, lest the building should not be strong\
        \ enough. So the plans were submitted to Mr. Philip Hardwicke, who substantially\
        \ confirmed them. Finally, in October, 1862, the tender of Messrs. Branson\
        \ and Murray was accepted, for \xA38,600, with some additions for improvements\
        \ suggested by Mr. Hardwicke. Owing to a strike amongst the stonemasons, the\
        \ progress of the building was much delayed. The Central Lending Library and\
        \ the Art Gallery were opened on the 6th of September, 1865, on the occasion\
        \ of the meeting of the British Association in Birmingham. The Mayor, Mr.\
        \ H. Wiggin, gave a breakfast at the Royal Hotel, and the company afterwards\
        \ adjourned to the Library, when prayers were offered by the Bishop of Worcester,\
        \ and speeches were made by the Mayor, Lord Stanley (the present Earl of Derby),\
        \ the Rev. Dr. Miller, and Mr. George Dawson. The first issue of books was\
        \ made on the 19th of September, the rooms having, in the interval, been used\
        \ by the British Association. The Central Beference Library was not opened\
        \ until about twelve months later, on the 26th of October, 1866, Mr. Edwin\
        \ Yates being then Mayor. The interval had been well employed in the selection\
        \ of books. This work was entrusted mainly to Mr. Samuel Timmins, Mr. Jacob\
        \ Phillips (then Chairman of the Committee), and Mr. J. D. Mullins, who was\
        \ appointed Chief Librarian on the 30th of May, 1865, at a salary of \xA3\
        200 a year. This selection was made on the following principles, laid clown\
        \ by the Committee, and approved by the Council : \u2014 -\" I. That the Library\
        \ should, as far as practicable, represent every phase of human thought, and\
        \ every variety of opinion. II. That books of permanent value and of standard\
        \ interest should form the principal portion of the Library, and that modern\
        \ and popular books should be added from time to time, as they are published.\
        \ III. That the Library should contain those rare and costly works which are\
        \ generally out of the reach of individual students and collectors, and which\
        \ are not usually found in provincial or private libraries.\" Acting on these\

        Sir Henry Parkes, Prime Minister of New South Wales (formerly a Birmingham
        man) ; and Mr. E. B. Nicholson, of the Bodleian Library. With the commencement
        of the new buildings the work of reconstructing the Library was at once taken
        in hand. This duty was entrusted to the Management Sub-committee, who appointed
        a Book Committee, consisting of Alderman Collings (then Chairman of the Libraries
        Committee), Alderman Barrow, Mr. Samuel Timmins, Mr. John Thaekray Bunce,
        and Mr. Edmund Tonks. On the retirement of Mr. Collings from the chairmanship,
        his place on the Book Committee was taken by the new Chairman, Mr. George
        James Johnson ; and by the gentlemen above named (greatly assisted by the
        skill and practical knowledge of Mr. J. D. Mullins, the chief librarian),
        the collection of books now (end of 1884) deposited in the Eeference Library,
        amounting to 73,600 volumes, was made. The principles upon which the Book
        Committee worked were stated in a memorandum published in the report for 1878-9.
        This document laid down as the chief lines of purchase (guided by the advice
        of experts in various departments) the acquisition of a collection representing
        all phases of thought and opinion ; books of permanent interest and standard
        rank ; rare and costly works out of the reach of students and private collectors
        ; a bibliographical section, as complete as could possibly be made ; special
        collections relating to Shakespearean literature ; and local books, iUustrating
        the history, industries, and progress of the town and the county. The biennial
        Report of the Libraries Committee for 1883 and 1884 gives a record of continued
        progress for those years. In 1883, by the passing of the Consolidation Act,
        the limit of the Library Rate to one penny in the pound was removed ; a much

        \ and Fourth streets ; this was first occupied by Dr. Geo. Thacher, Pastor,\
        \ subsequently President of Iowa State University. According to the records,\
        \ the first member admitted to the Church upon profession of faith, was Mrs.\
        \ Wheeler, now Mrs. Wm. Robinson. The first baptism of adults was Mary Manwell,\
        \ and of infants, Roger Leavitt. The ministers who have supplied the Church,\

    - ["HISTORY OF BLACK HAWK COUNTY. 399 Rev. James Harrison, still a much esteemed\
        \ and honored resident of Water- loo, was the next Pastor of the church, commencing\
        \ his labors in the Summer of 1856 and continuing until the Spring of 1868.\
        \ At that time, Rev. William Fithian assumed the pastorate, and continued\
        \ for several months in charge. The first church building, now occupied by\
        \ the Baptist society, was com- menced in 1856, but was not finished until\
        \ the following year, and was dedicated in the Fall. When the society began\
        \ planning for the edifice the country was in a flourishing condition ; settlers\
        \ were coming in rapidly ; money was compar- atively plenty, and no one expected\
        \ a sudden change, such as followed. The society planned for the future, and\
        \ built accordingly ; but when the financial crash of 1857 came, could net\
        \ fulfill their engagements. Aid that had been promised in the East failed\
        \ to come, owing to a bank failure ; property began to depreciate and members\
        \ to scatter. With all these discouraging surround- ings, it was thought best\
        \ to sell the property, which was accordingly done. After the sale of the\
        \ church, the society was for a long time without a Pastor, and its usual\
        \ services were suspended. \u2022 During the years 1860 and 1861, occasional\

        \ conducted by Rev. James M. Phillips, of Cedar Falls, and Rev. David Blakely.\

        \ he resigned his pastorate. The present pleasant and commodious brick church\
        \ on the corner of Fourth and Jefferson streets, was erected during the Summer\
        \ of 1867, and dedicated free of debt in November of that year. The building\
        \ was not completed without a struggle, and only with the assistance of contributions\
        \ from abroad, and a donation from the Church Erection Committee of the Pres-\
        \ byterian Church. Prominent among the contributors was Myron Phelps, Esq.,\
        \ of Lewistown, 111., father of Pastor Phelps, a most exemplary and Christian\
        \ man, who gave over $1,000. In the Summer of 1869, Rev. A. R. Olney, just\
        \ graduated at Union Theolog- ical Seminary, New York, commenced his labors\
        \ as Pastor of this church, and continued with them one year. He was succeeded\
        \ by Rev. W. W. Thorp in the Fall of 1870. During the year 1871, funds were\
        \ raised for the purchase of a pipe organ, and an addition was built in the\
        \ rear for an \" organ loft \" and Pastor's study, with session room, etc.\
        \ The advent of the organ was celebrated with a concert at the church on the\
        \ evening of November 22, 1871, at which the superior merits of the instrument\
        \ were fully demonstrated. Early in 1873, Mr. Thorp tendered his resignation,\
        \ to take effect the first Sunday in March. After his departure, there were\
        \ only occasional services until in August, 1873, when Rev. I. E. Carey commenced\

        November 18, 1865, the citizens of Waterloo held a meeting for the purpose
        of establishing a library. George Ordway was Chairman, and James W. Logan,
        Secretary of the meeting. A constitution was adopted and subscriptions made.
        At an adjourned meeting December 4, 1865, the subscribers met at Dr. Mason''s
        office and elected permanent officers, as follows : President, George W. Couch
        ; Vice President, R. A. Whitaker ; Secretary, James W. Logan ; Treasurer.
        A. T. Lusch ; Librarian, Dr. A. B. Mason ; Investing Committee, P. Mc- Isaacs,
        Dr. C. T. Ingersoll, J. W. Logan, to which were afterward added George Ordway
        and Dr. Mason. The library was first opened in Dr. Mason''s office, December
        2, 1867. Capt, (now Judge) S. Bagg was elected President of the Association,
        and the records do not indicate any election since. For several years the
        library was kept in active operation, and had on its shelves over a thousand
        volumes. Dr. Mason was succeeded by Judge D. W. Foote, as Librarian ; afterward,
        Henry Harrison and Dr. Williams acted, for short terms, in that capacity;
        and then came a time when the library took care of itself, the books became
        scat tered and many of them lost. In 1877, President Bagg and Secretary Logan
        appointed William G. Burbee Librarian, with instructions to collect the scattered
        volumes. July, 1878, Mr. Burbee had succeeded in collecting between 400 and
        500 volumes, which are stored in his carpenter shop, on Fifth street, of no
        use to anybody. There should be interest enough taken in this Association
        in this active town to revive the organization and make the Library a permanently
        use ful institution. FLORAL HILL GREEN HOUSE. One of the institutions of Waterloo,
        is the "Floral Hill Green House," es tablished, or rather commenced, in 1872,
        by J. A. Fowler, for many years well known as a prominent railroad man. Mr.
        Fowler has a magnificent collection of house and garden plants, and his green
        house is one of the most extensive in the West. Mr. Fowler, however, has devoted
        especial attention to the cultiva tion of the strawberry, and is hybridizing
        and originating new varieties, in which he has been very successful He procures
        the best varieties, and in the flowering season conveys the pollen from one
        plant to another by means of a feather, and does not depend upon the uncertain
        action of insects to accomplish this purpose. He has succeeded in producing
        a strawberry 8k inches in circumference, as large as a respectable-sized tomato.
        Another variety he has produced, called the "Iowa Prolific," is a marvel as
        an illustration of the power of intelligence to improve on nature. One of
        these plants produced 236 berries, and 70 quarts were produced on a little
        plat of ground 4x8 feet. Mr. Fowler is not satisfied yet, is continuing his
        experiments, and expects to produce strawberries as large as the largest tomatoes
        if his life is spared. So mote it be. He is unquestion-', 3]

    - ['HISTORY OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, NEW YORK. 270 autumn the board of trustees lost
        its oldest member, in the death of Leonard AVells, who had been a member since
        1832, a period of thirty-three years. 1844, and of president since 1865. Always
        interested in whatever was for the public weal, he had been a strong friend
        and supporter of the academy, and his loss was a severe one. In 1866 a new
        piano was bought, the old one, which had been in use since 1855, being worn
        badly. The trus tees at the same time purchased a Goodman melodeon. Aliss
        Alerriam was assisted by Aliss Sarah E. Sears ; and by Aliss Eva S. Pease,
        teacher of music ; Miss Alaria T. Conant, teacher of painting and drawing;
        and Aliss Nettie Harsha, primary department. From the earliest days of the
        institution there was a literary society maintained, under the supervision
        of the trustees. Dr. Bullions actively maintained this society, This society
        gathered a number of books, some being pur chased by the trustees and some
        being gifts of friends of which was called, in the early days, the Philologian
        society''. the institution. April 20, 1868, the trustees received a communication
        from the Young Alen''s Association of Cambridge, a society which had been
        organized two years previous to this time. The communication stated that the
        society had two hundred dollars iu its treasury, which they desired to donate
        to the academy upon certain con ditions, the most important being the following
        : That the money be expended in the purchase of books ; that the privileges
        of the library be extended to all members of the Young Alen''s association
        ; that upon the decease of said association, the trustees should open the
        library to the public upon the payment of a fee, not to exceed one dollar;
        that the board elect a librarian, subject to the approval of the association.
        The trustees accepted the proposition. The association passed out of existence
        shortly afterwards, and the library was opened to the public. It now contains
        over two thousand volumes. It is located in the addition to the academy, in
        the room originally constructed for a trus tees'' room. John Al. Stevenson,
        Jr., was first librarian. In 1873, on account of financial embarrassment,
        the trustees were at a loss how to sustain the institution. Unless the school
        could be endowed it must be closed. An effort to secure an endowment met with
        little encourage ment ; an effort for a Union school sidled, and the academy
        was finally leased to the trustees of the west district. Thus, after an existence
        of fifty-eight years, the Cam bridge Washington Academy was virtually closed;
        for although the trustees of the Union school district bound themselves to
        maintain an academic department, and have since done so, the school lost its
        distinctive character as an academy when this agreement was signed. The school
        had an honorable career, and no student of the Cambridge AVashington Academy
        need blush for her record. Instruction has been maintained in the academy
        by the Union school district to the present time. The school has been under
        the charge of the following teachers : AVm. E. Faulkner, Miss Alaggie Shiland,
        James McCoy, James L. King, and AL J. Oatman. Air. Oatman has now charge of
        the school. The following tables show the names of all the presi dents, secretaries,
        treasurers, trustees, and principals of Cambridge Washington Academy, from
        the date of its in corporation until the building was leased to the Union
        school district, with dates when they were elected and the dates when their
        office was vacated : After having charge of this school two years, in August,
        1867, W. S. Aumoek tendered his resignation, which was accepted. The number
        of students under Air. Aumock''s charge was two_ hundred and four. PRESIDENTS.
        His successor was Rev. Geo. I. Taylor. As compensa tion he received all incomes
        of the institution, from what ever source, less ten per cent., which was reserved
        by the trustees, he paying his assistants. He was assisted by Aliss Helen
        Al. Foster, preceptress; Aliss H. B. Taylor, teacher of music ; Airs. Alaria
        T. Conant, teacher of drawing and painting; and Aliss Ellen Al. Barnes in
        the primary depart ment. Air. Taylor remained in charge of the school one
        year. The number of students under Air. Taylor was one hundred and ninety-four.

        \ this church the congregation was organized by the election of three elders\
        \ in the month of November, 1792. Rev. James Proudfit preached on the occasion,\
        \ from Psalm 28, and 9th verse, ' Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance:\
        \ feed them also, and lift them up forever.' Ebenezer Clark, James Batty,\
        \ and Alexander Cowen were elected, and on the 18th day of December following\
        \ they were ordained to be ruling elders in this congregation by Rev. John\
        \ Dunlap, who had been settled over the Associate Reformed congre gation of\
        \ Cambridge in the year 1790. THE ARGYLE LIBRARY was formed at the house of\
        \ Pelcg Bragg, May 1, 1805, and the following trustees chosen : George Mairs,\
        \ Ebenezer Clark, Andrew Proudfit, James Green, and Alexander Cowan. It became\
        \ an incorporated body, and was an acknowledged power in its day, but declined\
        \ after a number of years, leaving no further records. THE ARGYLE SOCIAL LIBRARY\
        \ was composed of twenty odd members, and was incorporated March 26, 1823\
        \ ; the meeting for this purpose having been held at the house of Joseph Rowe.\
        \ \"About this time the congregation applied to the Legis lature and obtained\
        \ a charter, the corporate name being the First Incorporated Congregation\
        \ of Argyle, under the care of the Associate Reformed synod. In addition to\
        \ the Presbyterian element mentioned above, Argyle had a popu lation of different\
        \ nationalities, quite a large number of Dutch settlers, and its full proportion\
        \ of mere adventurers, such as usually locate in new settlements, where land\
        \ is free or can be had at a nominal price, many of these being un able to\
        \ either read or write, with little or no early religious training, and all\
        \ classes being addicted to the use of intoxi cating liquors. Argyle was apparently\
        \ a not very desirable place to attempt to build up a large and prosperous\
        \ congre gation. In the good providence of God the congregation, now fully\
        \ organized, were soou to have their own spiritual teacher. The trustees,\
        \ William Reid, Jr , David Sill, James McDougall, Alexander Bachop, George\
        \ W. Snyder, Pliny Freeman, and Jesse S. Leigh, attested the subscription\
        \ of more than forty pounds, as the law required, and proceeded to procure\
        \ a good assortment of standard books. These were kept at the county clerk's\
        \ office, Jesse S. Leigh ser ving as librarian. As soon as periodical literature\
        \ was more generally diffused the library was abandoned. RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES.\
        \ The first settlers of Argyle were imbued with strongly religious sentiments,\
        \ which early manifested themselves in the formation of religious societies,\
        \ and the consequent building of churches where they and their posterity might\
        \ worship. These houses, though humble at first, were erected to keep apace\
        \ with advancing civilization and its attendant styles of architecture. Early\
        \ pronounced in their professions, the sincerity of the people of the town\
        \ has been fully sustained by a judicious provision for fine houses of worship,\
        \ whose presence denotes the wealth, refinement, and morality of sons and\
        \ daughters of a God-fearing people. No portion of the history of Argyle will\
        \ be read with greater interest than that embraced in this chapter. \" On\
        \ the 2d day of May, 1793, Rev. George Mairs, who had for some years been\
        \ settled over a congregation at Coothill, in Ireland, demitted his charge\
        \ of said congrega- tion to the presbytery of Ballybay, of which he was a\
        \ member, and received from the said presbytery a letter of dismission, with\
        \ the purpose of emigrating to the United States of America. Accordingly he,\
        \ with his family and his brother (Bev. James Mairs) and family, sailed on\
        \ the 15th day of the same month from Ireland for New York, where the)* arrived\
        \ in the following August, and preached the first Sabbath alter their arrival\
        \ for Rev. John M. Mason, of the Associate Reformed church of that city, and\
        \ by his advice set out the next day for Salem, Washington County. Rev. G.\
        \ Mairs supplied the vacant congregations of Hebron and Argyle a few Sabbaths.\
        \ His preaching was so accepta- ble that a meeting of the two congregations\
        \ was called in the church, then recently built in Hebron, on the 27tb day\
        \ of September, 1793, at which Rev. John Dunlap presided, and moderated a\
        \ call, which was unanimous, for the Rev. George Mairs to become the pastor\
        \ of the united congre- gations above named, offering as support \xA3120,\
        \ being $300. This call Mr. Mairs accepted, and was installed as pastor of\
        \ the united charge on the 14th day of November thereafter, Rev. James Mairs\
        \ preaching the sermon from the 2d Co rinthians, 4th chapter, and 5th verse.\
        \ Rev. James Proudfit giving the charge. The call of Mr. Mairs was signed\
        \ by the following-named elders and trustees of the Hebron congregation :\
        \ Some years after the settlement in Salem of that staunch Presbyterian the\
        \ Rev. Thomas Clark, members of that faith came to the wilds of Argyle to\
        \ found themselves homes. These were sometimes visited by their reverend pastor,\
        \ who preached to them, although there was no regu lar congregation prior\
        \ to his leaving for South Carolina, in 1780. His successor at Salem was the\
        \ Rev. James Proud fit, who came from Pequa, Pa., in 1783, and, as he belonged\
        \ to the Associate Reformed synod, his congregation also adopted those principles.\
        \ A few years later, the settlers of Argyle were joined by Andrew Proudfit\
        \ and Ebenezer Clark, sons of Drs. Clark and Proudfit, who began to exert\
        \ themselves to form a congregation of the faith of their fathers; but this\
        \ purpose was not immediately accomplished, and several years elapsed before\
        \ a congregation was formed, from which sprang the present UNITED PRESBYTERIAN\
        \ CONGREGATION OF ARGYLE. The history of that body has been so faithfully\
        \ portrayed by Alexander P. Robinson that we compile this sketch largely from\

        \ elapsed before this was definitely agreed on. On the 15th of July, 1848,\

        \ a building committee, with full power to proceed in the erection of a house,\

        \ was voted \u2014 seventy-four to thirteen \u2014 to be raised by tax in\

        \ to offer them as part of the evi dence, an omission that the attorneys for\

        \ of his works published, it is believed, is unprecedented in poetical literature\
        \ \u2014 as they amount to upwards of three hundred.10 The influence of Burns\
        \ on the imaginative literature of Scot land has been deep, widespread, and\
        \ abiding. It is a fact that many Scotsmen have been so touched, so moved,\
        \ and stirred to the core of their being, by his writing, as to arouse an\
        \ irrepres sible feeling within them to compose verse themselves ; and thus\
        \ it is, that to-day there are so many Scotsmen in the humble walks of life\
        \ who can write passable and even animated verse and song, men who can appreciate\
        \ and even criticise the highest products of the imaginative and elaborative\
        \ faculties of the race. Let us, then, calmly endeavour to realise the influence\
        \ which Burns has exercised over the entire mind of the Scottish people, under\
        \ the heads of removing prejudices and superstition, fostering liberty and\
        \ independence of spirit, and greater freedom of thought. In regard to prejudice\
        \ and superstition, the satirical and comic features of many of Burns' pieces\
        \ have had a most bene ficial effect upon the mind of the people. In conjunction\
        \ with other influences, they have contributed greatly to enlighten their\
        \ understanding, and thus enabled them to banish from their mind a host of\
        \ delusive and absurd fears.11 Let anyone com- 10 When on a visit to Glasgow,\

        \ superstitions of the people concerning the attributes of Satan, the elements\

    - ['HISTORICAL LITERATURE OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 165 But a more important change
        appeared in the eighteenth century ; the critical examination of historical
        evidence began to be recognised and effectively applied, and a clearer conception
        of the requisites of historical inquiry was manifested ; although it cannot
        be affirmed that adequate historical conceptions of the human race were then
        attained, as such conceptions are only now beginning to be freely recognised,
        and as yet they are imperfect even in the thought of the most eminent philosophers.
        But much has been done to clear the ground, and prepare a vast collection
        of valuable materials upon which to form a more complete conception of man.
        Let us now proceed to indicate concisely wrhat Scotland has contributed to
        this department of culture. David Hume, as he himself avows, was animated
        by a passionate love of literary fame ; and thus he turned aside from his
        philosophical studies to try his skill in historical composition. It seems
        that he had conceived the design of some historical composition before the
        year 1747. But he also desired to combat the popular prejudices in favour
        of Queen Elizabeth, and against the Stuarts ; and so he resolved to begin
        his History of Great Britain with the reign of James IV. For this purpose,
        in 1752, he assumed gratuitously the office of librarian to the Faculty of
        Advocates in Edinburgh, and in that rich store of historical materials, the
        Advocate''s Library, he began the com position of his History of Great Britain.
        The first volume appeared in 1754, containing the reigns of James VI. and
        Charles I. ; the second volume was published in 1757, the third and fourth
        in 1759, and the last two in 1762. His work was not at once successful. The
        first volume was bitterly assailed by the Whigs, and Hume was greatly disappointed,
        both from the attacks made upon him and from the slow sale of the work. By
        and by, however, his history became very popular, new editions appeared in
        rapid succession, and Hume was placed at the head of English historians. But

        years ago this University acquired the library of the late Sir William Hamilton,
        which amounted to 8000 volumes, including many treatises on logic and metaphysics.
        This library is especially rich in works on mining, works on engineering,
        works on music, and medical works. The Stirling Library in Glasgow, established
        in 1790, con tains upwards of 40,000 volumes ; and it has a lending depart
        ment and a reference department. It contains many valuable works, and a large
        number of patents. Another reference library in the same building, called
        the Library of Baillie''s Institution, is newly established, " in a hall reconstructed
        and fitted up for the purpose, where the trustees of the Institution are in
        the course of forming a very valuable public reference library ". Through
        the kindness of Mr. Mason, the librarian, I had the pleasure of seeing and
        inspecting this new reference library, in 1887, and I saw at once in looking
        round the shelves that the works had been selected with remarkable discrimina
        tion and judgment. The Mitchell Library in Glasgow was opened in 1877 ; and
        it is a reference, consulting, and reading library, not a lending or circulating
        one. It contains upwards of 71,000 volumes, re presenting all branches of
        literature and science ; in the histori cal department it is very complete
        and valuable, especially on British history ; science and art is also well
        represented in this library. Touching its rare coUection of Scottish poetry
        and editions of Burns, I have already spoken in preceding pages.4 The Library
        of the University of Aberdeen contains about 91,000 volumes and a considerable
        number of MSS. There are besides six special or class libraries for the use
        of students, which together form about 4000 volumes. The Society of Advocates
        in Aberdeen have a pretty large library, which con tains many valuable works.

        More or less, he gives the like tone to his subordinates. Mr. O., the chief
        engineer, of an old and good Spanish family, a native of the Canary Islands,
        and brought up at Havanna, forms a singular contrast to his Anglo-American
        companions. He is a mixture of a caballero and an ascetic Castilian. One has
        only to look at him to see that he is a man in a thousand. This first impression
        is confirmed by his con versation. Still young, he owes his place entirely
        to his merits. His leisure moments are devoted to serious studies. His cabin,
        which opens on one side to the deck, and on the other to the machinery, is
        a very fair indication of his turn of mind and the higher aspirations of his
        soul. A well-chosen little library, where theological and scientific works
        stand side by side with classical authors and the writings of Donoso Cortes
        ; two pots of plants, which his -wife gave him before his departure, and which,
        by dint of care, he has been able to keep alive in spite of the deleterious
        effect of the sea. air ; and the portrait of this young lady. Can you conceive
        anything like the poetic sadness and solitariness of this abnormal existence
        ? He loves his profession, it is true, and lives on good terms with his comrades.
        But, a fervent Catholic, he passes his life with men whose last thought is
        religion ; passionately in love with his young and beautiful wife, he sees
        her once in three months for eighteen days ; devoted to speculative studies,
        he finds himself com pelled, almost the whole day, to watch a machine and
        count its revolutions. The doctor on board, a Southerner, and a man of a certain
        age, is a philosopher. He looks at everything on the worst side. His speciality
        is to examine the reverse of the medal. His great originality and a kind of
        caustic wit, redeemed by a fund of good humour and immense experience, give
        a peculiar charm to his conversation. In general, the great attraction of
        foreign travel is to meet men of a totally different stamp from yourself.
        Birth, education, ways of seeing and acting, experi ence of life, everything
        in them is different. The doctor is, likewise, the librarian. Every day, at
        a certain hour, he distri butes the books you ask for. There is a good collection
        of classical English authors, and what is very useful to me, tlie best and
        most recent works on China and Japan.', 1]

        emancipation by a visit to the public balls, or to the restaurants of Clichy,
        leading a very Rabelaisian existence. Some, taking advantage of their hirsute
        appendage, and loth to part with it, enlist in the national militia as sappers,
        adopting the nick-names of "Terror" or "Cleave- Mountain," in order to complete

        by providing them with a living. If they are scholars they have the arts,
        the learned pro fessions, and commerce to fall back upon ; if they are simply
        strong-limbed, agriculture is open to them, and by-and-by war will be. There
        is a market for their intelligence and for their strength. The greatest number
        whose minds have been given to study all their lives, such as the Benedictines

        monastic superiors are eager to find places in private families to teach children
        reading, writing, and arithmetic, or else to keep the books in some counting-house,
        or to become librarians. Nearly all, satisfied with the little pittance voted

        The medical fraternity of the city compares favorably with any section of
        the country. Their names are as follows : Drs. S. 0. Kerr, D. Lewis, A. Stockwell,
        A. Reynolds, Frederick Cole, J. Q. Adams and D. W. Lamme. Several of these
        gentlemen were in the medical department of the army during the late war,
        where they acquitted themselves with honor and distinction. The bar is represented
        by the following legal gentlemen : Judge J. J. Cas sell, Hon. A. M. Cavan,
        M. H. Cassell, W. S. Gibson, Walter Bennett. W. 0. Randall and W. H. Bullock.
        Of these, J. J. Cassell was for several terms Judge of the Recorder''s Court
        while in existence, and A. M. Cavan has served in the State Legislature as
        a member from Woodford County. The city of El Paso has two very handsome little
        parks, one in each ward, and each park embraces one full block. They are enclosed
        by neat fences, are elegantly laid out, filled with beautiful trees, and add
        materially to the beauty of the city. The name of El Paso was given the city
        in honor of the township, which bears the same name. VILLAGE OF KAPPA The
        village of Kappa was laid out soon after the completion of the Illinois Central
        Railroad through the township, and was at one time a place of consider able
        business. Long before El Paso appeared above the tall grass and the wild flowers
        of the prairie, Kappa was a town of note, running two or three large stores
        and dealing extensively in grain. The first store was opened by a Canadian,
        when the town was first laid off. A Mr. Reed, formerly of Spring Bay, was
        the second to go into the mercantile business in this little village. He kept
        the first post office in the village, and which was several years after the
        one kept by Horn in the township, some distance from Kappa. Reed afterward
        sold out to Asa Sparks, who continued some time in the trade. C. Schafer,
        one of the successful merchants of El Paso, settled at first in Kappa. He
        says that it was then the best business point on the west side of the county.
        He was looking for a place to locate, and made up his mind that Kappa was
        the identical spot. He remembers seeing a hundred wagons at one time in the
        village, all loaded with grain and waiting to get to the scales to weigh their
        loads. He finally settled in Kappa, where he did a good business, until the
        completion of the Toledo, Peoria & Warsaw Railroad to the Illinois Central,
        which gave birth to the city of El Paso, and sealed the doom of Kappa. The
        atter place dwindled down to a small business, and trade flowed into El Paso.
        Mr. Schafer left Kappa and went with the crowd. The village now contains but
        one store, and a post office, kept by George Lollman, one church, and a school
        house, with a few residences.', 1]

        taking no particular side in the politics of the day. The El Paso Cemetery
        is handsomely laid off grounds, beautifully orna mented and well kept. It
        contains 40 acres of land, surrounded by a substan tial fence, and thickly
        set in grass. Many fine monuments and marble columns show the love felt by
        surviving friends for the dear ones that are gone. The first death in the
        city of El Paso is supposed to have been three little children of Isaac Jenkins,
        who died with scarlet fever in the Winter of 1857-8, and so near together
        that all three were buried in one grave. A child of Levi Darling is said by
        some to have died during the Summer previous to the death of Jen kins'' children,
        but we could not ascertain the facts definitely. The first mar. riage in the
        city is accredited to Eben Hotchkiss and Miss Celia Bano, about 1857. GENERAL
        BUSINESS Referring to the general business of the City of El Paso, we make
        the fol- lowing extracts from the address of Dr. Lamme already referred to
        : " The amount of goods sold annually is about $400,000 ; agricultural implements
        sold annually, $100,000 ; coal, about 1,000 tons, or 400 car loads. Goods,
        including products of our own shops, not far short of $600,000, annually.
        * * * * Grain is the chief export, and it is estimated that at least half
        a million bushels of grain is handled at this point alone, to say nothing
        of what is bought at neighboring points by our merchants. The following is

        the history of El Paso, an attempt was made for a public library. But with
        so many other demands upon her finances, little was done toward the enterprise.
        About the year 1873, the subject was taken up by the ladies, and a meeting
        called at the residence of Mrs. W. G. Randall, who had been most active in
        infusing interest into the project. After considerable discussion, and not
        without some opposition, a library association was finally formed, with the
        following corps of officers : President, Mrs. Dr. Stockwell ; Vice President,
        Mrs. J. J. Cassell ; Secretary, Mrs. D. O''Brien ; Treasurer, Mrs. W. R. Bigham
        ; Librarian, Mrs. S. H. Worthington. The library contains about 800 volumes,
        is in good condition, out of debt, and adding continually to the number of
        its volumes.', 1]
    - ["331 HISTORY OF WOODFORD COUNTY. As pertinent to this part of the subject,\
        \ we take the following extract from the Eureka College Messenger, a paper\
        \ published by Prof. Fisher. Referring to the resolution adopted at Abingdon,\
        \ the editor says: \"The authorities of Walnut Grove Academy at once commenced\
        \ work under that Abingdon reso lution, and pushed forward their work with\
        \ some degree of energy. The result was the securing a liberal college charter,\
        \ the organization of Eureka College, the erection of a more substantial and\
        \ commodious college edifice, and a con tinued series of regular college sessions,\
        \ from the first organization in the Fall of 1856, to the present time, passing,\
        \ without suspension, the terrible financial convulsion of 1857, the still\
        \ more terrible shock of revolution in 1861 and 1862, the ever memorable crisis\
        \ of 1873, and the gradual increasing depression of business all over the\
        \ country-, even down to the present time. Thousands of students, young men\
        \ and young women, have been received within these walls, have received liberal\
        \ training for good, and have gone forth into the wide world to do battle\
        \ for themselves and humanity.\" \u2022 \"This enterprise,\" concludes the\
        \ editor, \" that first began to assume form and shape in an humble log cabin,\
        \ standing near the eastern terminus of what is now called Conover avenue,\
        \ as early as the year 1847, under the care of the venerable John T. Jones,\
        \ that was revived in the small frame house, nestled among the underbrush\
        \ and brambles, at the roadside, near the present cemetery of Eureka, in the\
        \ Fall of 1848, has an unwritten history, which none but its founders, who\
        \ have stood by it through evil report and good report, can ever appreciate.\
        \ Its career has been one of success, but not of that flattering kind which\
        \ the world regards as a grand success.\" When the school was organized under\
        \ the college charter, Elder William Brown, of Springfield, became the first\
        \ President. Upon his resignation, Prof. C. L. Loos was chosen, who administered\
        \ affairs for one year, and returned to Bethany. The Presidents in order from\
        \ time have been : George Callender, B. W. Johnson, H. W. Everest, A. M. Weston\
        \ and B. J. Radford. The following are at present members of the Faculty :\
        \ B. J. Radford, A. M., President, and Professor of Philosophy and Sacred\

        He urgently dwelt on the necessity of a wide amnesty, and mode rate and liberal
        terms, and he then proceeded to point out certain points which ought to be
        taken possession of by the English in order to sever New England from the
        other colonies, and secure the immediate subjugation of the southern pro vinces.
        If this plan were adopted, and a proclamation of amnesty issued, and if no
        untoward accident, such as a rupture with a European power, occurred, he was
        convinced that in two months every spark of civil war would be extinguished
        in the colonies.1 The Americans, though they were well aware of the insub
        ordinate and capricious character of Lee, appear to have had no suspicion
        whatever of his treason, but in September 1780 a terrible shock was given
        to the confidence of their army by the discovery of the treachery of Benedict
        Arnold. To anyone who attentively follows the letters of Washington, it will
        appear evident that there was no officer in the American army of whom for
        a long period he wrote in terms of higher, warmer, and more frequent eulogy.
        Arnold was in truth an eminently brave and skilful soldier, and in the early
        stages of the struggle his services had been of the most distinguished kind.
        In conjunction with Colonel Allen, he had obtained the first great success
        of the war by capturing Ticonderoga and Crown Point in the summer of 1775.
        He had fallen wounded leading the forlorn hope against Quebec on the memorable
        day on which Montgomery was killed. In the gallant stand that was made at
        Ticonderoga in October 1776, he had been placed at the head of the American
        fleet, and his defence of Lake Champlain against overwhelming odds had been
        one of the most brilliant episodes of the whole American war. He took a leading
        part in the campaign which ended with the capitu lation of Saratoga, led in
        person that fierce attack on the British lines on October 7, 1777, which made
        the position of Burgoyne a hopeless one, was himself one of the first men
        to enter the British hues, and fell severely wounded at the head of his 1

        \ Wareham Walker. It was sub- sequently removed to the State of New Ysork,\
        \ and was succeeded in Elgin, in 1847, by the Elgin Gazette, which continued\
        \ until consolidated with the Advo- cate, in 1874. In 1851, the Fox River\
        \ Courier commenced its brief existence in support of the political views\
        \ of the Whigs, but, never proving a financial success, the publication was\
        \ soon suspended. The Elgin Palladium followed, in 1853, edited by Mr. Hough,\
        \ and was changed about three years later to the Kane County Journal, published\
        \ by Lyman k Smith. In 1858, a Democratic paper was established by Grosvenor\

        \ in turn by the Elgin Chronicle, edited by Ed. Keogh, and finally merged\

    - ['284 HISTORY OF KANE COUNTY. Various important topics seem to have agitated
        the village during the year, prominent among which was the temperance question.
        A society was organ ized early in the Winter, with E. D. Terry as President,
        and Perseus Brown, also known as " Dr." and " Cooper " Brown, as Secretary,
        and Dr. 0. D. Howell (then a school teacher), acting under its direction,
        delivered the first temperance lecture in the town. Spirituous liquor was
        then as common an article of trade as cut nails or calico prints, and the
        society did not pretend to inculcate total abstinence among its members, but
        simply the temperate use of alcoholic drinks. But there was one in the society,
        Mr. Brown, the worthy Secretary, who was as radical in his denunciation of
        drink and the drunkard as are any of our modern teetotalers. He would neither
        use the beverage him self nor in any possible way, however remote, would he
        assist any one to use it. If a man brought him a barrel to repair, he had
        been known to ask for what purpose he wished to use it, and if he replied
        " to hold whisky," some other cooper than " Cooper " Brown must mend it. This
        eccentric but conscientious man was drowned some years later, by accident,
        in Fox River. The year 1837 also witnessed the building of a carding mill
        on the upper end of the island, by J. G. Stolp, which was subsequently moved
        to a point further down the river, where the business developed into its present
        propor tions, Stolp''s Woolen Mills being now known throughout the West. In
        1838, Mr. Winton suggested the feasibility of purchasing a Town Library ;
        and, as the suggestion was favorably received, an association was formed for
        that purpose, each member paying $2.00 for a share. One hundred dollars were
        thus raised ancl expended in the purchase of popular and instruc tive works,
        Harpers'' Family Library forming an important part of them. Although the interest
        in the library diminished to a considerable extent, at one time, it has never
        been allowed to perish, and during the last fifteen years has been increased
        by successive additions, until at the present time it contains up ward of
        two thousand volumes, embracing all the various departments of litera ture
        and science, standard works upon history ancl philosophy, complete sets of
        the books of all the best writers of romance and books of reference, many
        of of which are to be found in no private library in the city. A great advance
        was made in its history in the fall of 1864,* when a number of the most influ
        ential and intelligent men in the city conceived the plan of establishing
        a read ing room in connection with it. Previously, the few books which had
        been collected had been generally kept in the private house of the Librarian,

        \ in which Rev. Mr. Lyndale, the resident Pastor in Geneva, preached once\

        \ ten years ago, a society, formed by the young people of the village for\
        \ literary purposes, commenced a library. The use of the volumes was lim ited\
        \ to members of the organization, and outsiders were not allowed to remove\
        \ them from the shelves. Several of the intelligent business men feeling the\
        \ need ofa collection of books to which all should have free access, the society\
        \ was induced to contribute its collection to that purpose, and with liberal\
        \ subscrip tions in money from many of the citizens, 700 volumes were obtained.\
        \ This number has been increased, by general subscriptions, to 1,000. The\
        \ rules of the association are exceedingly liberal. Any one \u2014 a resident\
        \ of the village or a stranger \u2014 above fourteen years of age, is allowed\
        \ to remove a volume at a time and retain it for two weeks. It contains many\
        \ valuable works of romance and books of reference, history and biography.\
        \ Its officers are John Van Nort wick, President; J. O. McClellan, Vice President;\
        \ Wm. Burnham, Treasurer; F. H. Buck, Librarian. It is supported by subscription,\
        \ some of the citizens contributing largely for its increase and support.\
        \ Its President has given $100 annually since its organization. BELLEVUE HOSPITAL\

        \ the most enterprising in the promotion of every object which was projected\
        \ for its prosperity, and accordingly, in 1853-4, they built, with the assistance\

        of whom 68 were ladies. All students are under the careful government of the
        Faculty. The college year is divided into three terms of thirteen weeks each.
        The Summer vacation continues ten weeks. Public examinations of all classes
        are held at the close of each term. These examinations are considered important,
        and students absenting themselves from an examination are required to pass
        a full examination at the commencement of the succeeding term for class standing.
        Grading is done by the scale of 0 to 10. Any student having a standard in
        any study below 6 is not advanced from that study until it has been successfully
        repeated. Like every institution of learning, Western College has, at different
        periods. enjoyed different degrees of prosperity, and varied in its rank as
        a college. While the men connected with it may justly be considered among
        the prime causes of these variations, surrounding circumstances, for which
        no one was responsible, and various complicated causes have conduced to determine
        the status of the institution. But it is not so much to its past and present
        as to its promises for the future that the friends of Western College look
        with pleasure. True, it has done a noble work. It has furnished a number of
        teachers, professors and principals for the schools of the Church in the West
        and Northwest. Through the min istry, it is adding new life and bringing greater
        success to the general work of the Church. A number of its students are rising
        to distinction in the various secular professions, and filling public positions
        of profit and honor. We are by no means to measure its work solely by the
        number of graduates it has sent out. Scores of young men and women, whom circumstances
        permitted to spend but from one to three years within its halls, have gone
        forth to do them selves honor and bless the world.', 1]

        \ PRESENT. From the first, both sexes have enjoyed equal advantages and have\
        \ received the same degrees. During the first years of the College, the old\
        \ Classical Course of study held entire sway. In 1860, the Scientific Course\
        \ was organized, and, in 1873. fur ther facilities were added by inaugurating\
        \ the Civil Engineering Course. By gradual progression, these courses have\
        \ been brought to a high standard, and the character of the College has been\
        \ much improved by increasing the amount and exactness of the requirements\
        \ for admission. An extensive and thorough Preparatory Department is maintained\
        \ in con nection with the institution. The Collegiate Course is of four, and\
        \ the Preparatory Course of two, years. A Normal Course is formed each year\
        \ for the preparation of those students who expect to become teachers. An\

        enabled to prosecute my special historical inquiries with ease and advantage.
        Indeed, this Lib rary has been of great and indispensable use to me. And I
        now gratefully thank the Senatus for so freely STanting me the use of it ;
        and also the late Librarian. Mr. Fyfe, now Professor of Moral Philosophy,
        and his successor, Mr. Walker, and all the assistant Librarians, for their
        uniform kindness and attention in everything which could facilitate my researches.
        Eegarding the ascertainment of facts, I have spared no labour or research
        to make myself fully conversant with them. And although some trifling errors
        may be detected, which, in so large an undertaking, may have escaped my notice,
        the general accuracy of the work may be relied on. But some classes of facts
        are of more value and importance than others, and I have done my best to observe
        this relative value of facts throughout the work. Touching the method I have
        chosen, doubtless there is ground for difference of opinion. My aim throughout
        being to ascertain the essentials of everything that had contributed to the
        development and to the progress of the nation, I have considered nothing to
        be irrelevant which seems to have had any influence upon the civilisation
        of the people. Merely to generalise or state results without inquiring into
        facts and circumstances is altogether alien to my conception and method, as
        I believe, that in the present state of historical know ledge, such a method
        would be comparatively worthless. The original design of the work has been
        curtailed', 2]

        association was organized in 1862 by some thirty of the leading farmers of
        the town and has maintained a vigorous existence from that time to the present.
        The object of this society is the advancement of agriculture by means of lectures,
        essays, discussions and books. A library of about 300 volumes consisting mostly
        of works on agriculture, had been collected, when the town library was started
        in 1874, and the club donated their books to the latter institution. The meetings
        are held fortnightly during the Winter and intermitted during the busy months
        of Summer. Occasionally, social sessions are held at the houses of members,
        when ladies are admitted. The club has done good service to the agriculture
        of the town, and incidentally has been of benefit by stimulating thought and
        encouraging its expression, and by cultiva ting social and neighborly graces.
        Alexander Hyde was the first President of the club, and John A. Decker is
        the present incumbent of this office. FREE MASONS. The Evening Star Lodge
        of Free and Accepted Masons was constituted in Lee by charter from the Grand
        Lodge of Massachusetts, October 10, 1795, and has included among its members
        many of the best citizens of this and neighboring towns. Its first Master
        was Judge William Walker of Lenox, whose name alone was sufficient to give
        character to the Lodge. The present Master is Alonzo Bradley. This association

        School, which was suspended during the Winter season- In 1826, June 9, "the
        Church voted to become the Sab bath-School Society of Lee, and to be an auxiliary
        to the Massachusetts Sabbath-School Union." 1829, April 17, when the School
        numbered 230, and 70 more were in Bible classes, Deacon Nathan Bassett was
        chosen by the Church, Sunday-School Superintendent ; William Porter, Esq.,
        Secretary and Treasurer; Abner Taylor, Librarian. The Church had voted, 1824,
        September 9, that some part ofthe semi-annual collection for the American
        Education Society be appropriated to the purchase of books and tracts for
        the children belonging to the Sabbath-School. Committees some years appointed
        to bring in scholars would largely increase the numbers in spite of interrup
        tions occasioned by the death or removal of pastors. When Deacon Caleb Belden
        was chosen Superintendent, special efforts were made to furnish clothing to
        any poor children. In 1853, when Dr. Gale became pastor, the library was small,
        the different classes had different lessons, the children were fewer than
        now, the singing was chiefly by adults, and the Sunday-school concerts were
        seldom attended by the children. In 1861 and 1862, class-books were kept,
        and the number of verses learned, marked. New books were added to the library
        of a higher grade, and a new system of library registration adopted. Christ
        mas was observed with festivities appropriate for children. In the Spring
        of 1867, many of the scholars felt the breathings of a better life. Seventy-five
        from the school during the period of five years preceding and including this,
        connected themselves with the church. Benevolent contributions increased year
        by year. Previous to 1857, the amount annually collected, averaging $50.00.

        and particularly the vices of Sabbath breaking, intemperance in the use of
        spirituous liquors, and profaneness." In the third article, the members pledged
        themselves to furnish the poor with employment, " that indolence may not betray
        them into vice," and also " to discourage by all wise and discreet measures
        the unnecessary use of ardent spirits." The names of nearly a hundred citizens,
        apparently all the leading men of the town, are found appended to this constitution.
        Dr. Hyde was made President and Dr. Bartiett Secretary of this moral reform

        FIRST TOWN LIBRARY. Early in the present century, the leading men of the town
        combined for the establishment of what was called a " town library," but it
        was really a proprietors'' library, as none were permitted to draw books from
        it except owners of stock. The records of this institution cannot be found,
        but it is known to have done great service in promoting the cause of education
        and good morals in this community. The books, some 300 volumes in all, were
        mostly of the staple kind, treating of history, biography, travels, science
        and religion. Works of poetry were scarce, and of fiction very scarce. Edward
        V. Whiton, son of Gen. Joseph Whiton, was at one time librarian, and being
        fond of reading perused most of the historical books, and thus laid the foundation
        for the eminence in the legal profession which he afterwards attained, becoming
        Chief Justice of Wisconsin. When " The Young Men''s Asso ciation of Lee "
        was organized in 1852, the books remain ing in this old library were transferred

        commenced the practice of an attorney at law, and was successful in business
        and highly esteemed in the community. He was elected to various offices in
        the town ; judge of probate, town clerk and treasurer nineteen years, and
        other offices, and was sent to the legislature two terms and was senator from
        the fifteenth district in 1870. He was also elected deacon of the Congregational
        church; and was a diligent laborer in the Sun day school. He is remembered
        with much pleasure and cordial good feeling by the people of the town. In
        1870, he removed to Hartford, and entered into the practice of law with his
        brother Herman N. Barbour, since deceased. He was largely influenced to this
        removal for the purpose of the better edu cation of his children. Florimond
        D. Fyler, son of Harlow and Sibyl R. (Tolls) Fyler, was born in Newfield in

        the work returned to Torrington. His health being quite poor at this time
        he was compelled to abandon the purpose of a higher course of education ;
        and he commenced the study of law in the office of Judge Gideon Hall at Winsted,
        where he continued as his health would allow until the spring of 1864, when
        he attended Yale law school that term. He was admitted to the bar, in 1864,
        and returned to Yale law school and studied one year and received the degree
        LL.B., July, 1865. In September, 1865, he located in Winsted as an attorney
        at law. He was a member of the legislature in the May session of 1872. He
        was elected by the legislature of 1877, judge of the district court of Litchfield

        \ was quiet and attentive, and apparently as deeply interested as any we have\

        of Joliet, is President of thc company. The Joliet Public Library was organized
        and opened to the public in No vember, 1875. It is a free public library,
        and is kept up by taxation. A well stocked reading room is in connection with
        the Library, where all the period icals and leading publications of the day
        are kept on file for the benefit of those who feel disposed to pay a visit
        to the place. The Board of Directors of the Library Association are : G. D.
        A. Parks, Mrs. H. S. Smith, Dorrance Di bell, Mrs. E. M. Raynor, Benjamin
        Olin, A. W. Heise, Thomas J. Kelly, Edwin Porter and George Munroe. G. D.
        A. Parks is President; Mrs. H. S. Smith, Vice President; Dorrance Dibell,
        Clerk, and Miss Charlotte Aiken, Librarian. This association bought the books
        owned by the old Joliet Histor ical Society, and have now about 1,500 volumes,
        and are adding more as fast as their means will allow them. The Joliet Historical
        Society was organized in 1867, and assumed the liabilities of the old Library
        ; and it, in its turn, was succeeded by the present Library. Among the private
        libraries of Joliet is that of Hon. W. A. Steel, which consists of several
        thousand volumes, and em braces most of the standard works of the day, together
        with many old and rare books not often found in a private library. Joliet
        was supplied with street cars, this modern addition to city travel, in 1873.
        Their lines encircle the city, affording cheap transportation within its limits
        to all who desire this mode of transit to " Walker''s Express." The en terprise
        of a street railway was inaugurated by E. T. Chase and Norman Carl. They sold
        it to a man named Cooper ; and he, after operating it for a time, sold it
        to the present owner and manager, J. A. Henry. While, apparently, not doing
        a very extensive business, it is yet paying a small dividend above running
        expenses. Oakwood Cemetery was laid out in 1854, and organized under act of
        the Legislature in 1857, receiving its charter from the State. It is beautifully
        sit uated on a gentle eminence on the north bank of Hickory Creek, east of
        the city limits, and reached by a branch of the City Railway. The grounds
        are handsomely and artistically laid out with serpentine walks and drives,
        well graded and graveled. Cultivated flowers, ornamental shrubbery and native
        forest trees add their beauty to the place, while the " green grass grows
        rank in the vapors of decaying mortality." The beauty and care bestowed on
        the grounds show a kind regard for the " loved and lost " by surviving friends.
        St. Patrick''s Cemetery (Catholic) is a beautiful burying-ground, and kept
        in good order by the Catholic citizens of Joliet. St. John''s Cemetery (German
        Cath olic) is situated northwest of the city, and is a beautiful and well-kept
        church yard. The professions, both legal and medical, are well and ably represented
        in Joliet, and combine an array of talent that will compare favorably with

        \ little town unfavorably, and when the Chicago k Southwestern Road was built\
        \ across the county, leaving Hibbs ville two miles on one side, the people\
        \ migrated in various directions, and most of the buildings were removed at\
        \ the same time. So it goes \u2014 the engineer's transit makes unavailing\
        \ the plans laid by the pioneers for the location of towns. Had not Numa been\
        \ established, it is prob able that the business of Hibbsville would have\
        \ long remained. There is one store in the place, owned by James Hibbs. THE\
        \ TOWNSHIP. It is stated that the pioneer settler of Franklin was Joseph Jump,\
        \ a well known character among the first inhabitants, who made a claim in\
        \ 1848. He had, however, been in the county two or three years prior to that\
        \ time. Those who came next were James Hibbs, Mr. Barney and Mr. Parker, in\
        \ 1853. The post office at Livingston was established in 1858, with E. 0.\
        \ Smith as Postmaster. A Baptist society was formed in the vicinity of Livingston\
        \ in 1855, the organizing members being Benjamin Barney and wife, L. G. Parker\
        \ and wife, A. E. Stevens and wife, Levi Wafford and wife, the first meeting\
        \ being held at Mr. Parker's house. The first preacher was Elder Blackburn,\
        \ whose successors have been Elders John Osborn, Bolster, Benton, Burkholder,\
        \ Turton, Parker and Archer. The society now meets at the Livingston Schoolhouse,\
        \ but intend to build in 1879, as it now owns two acres of ground for church\
        \ and cemetery purposes, the donation of E. 0. Smith, Esq. The Deacons of\
        \ the church now are Allen Pettitt, R. B. Williamson and William Condra ;\
        \ Samuel N. Bell, Clerk. There are about sixty members. A Union Sabbath School\
        \ is maintained here. H. L. Halladay is Superin tendent ; E. 0. Smith, Assistant\
        \ ; Charles Landers, Secretary ; James Mur phy, Librarian. The teachers are\
        \ E. 0. Smith, Mrs. Nancy J. Parker, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Hallady, R. B. Wilkinson,\
        \ and Mrs. Helen Wood. The average attendance is thirty-nine. The earliest\
        \ marriage remembered was that of Benjamin Joiner to a niece of Absalom Foster,\
        \ probably about 1854. A steam saw-mill was set in operation by E. 0. Smith\
        \ in 1858, followed soon after by a flouring-mill. During the war, a \"contraband\"\
        \ named John Jones, found employment .about the premises of Mr. Parker, who\
        \ was absent in the service. John was a quiet, steady-going fellow, and, not\
        \ long after he became an inmate of the Parker family, joined the church.\
        \ John's residence in Franklin was regarded as highly reprehensible by several\
        \ citizens, most of whom lived about Hibbsville, and who had posted notices,\
        \ intimating that the negro must leave. One night, Mrs. Parker was awakened\
        \ by a loud crash, but believing that a pantry-shelf had fallen, and being\
        \ very tired, did not get up to ascertain the cause. In the morning, she found\
        \ that a window had been broken and the weather-boarding near it bruised by\
        \ a volley of stones thrown by the heroic enemies of Jones. The next morning,\
        \ a denizen of Hibbsville went over to tell Mrs. Parker that a meeting had\
        \ been held at that place the previous evening, in which a reso lution was\
        \ passed that John must leave the neighborhood. While he was talk ing, a mounted\
        \ party appeared, riding toward the Parker house. They were seen by Mr. E.\
        \ 0. Smith, who, fearing that mischief was meant, ran over and confronted\
        \ the men as they dismounted at the gate. The party turned out to be a detachment\
        \ of the State-line patrol, formed of citizens along both sides of", 1]

        \ Burlington k Southwestern Railway and the Missouri, Iowa & Nebraska, and\
        \ is not a ticket station on either line. It is in Section 25, Caldwell, and\
        \ near the Chariton. The railway companies have, so far expended about $150\
        \ on depot buildings, which are occupied by a family who furnish well- cooked\
        \ and palatable meals to pass engers who are compelled to wait here several\
        \ hours to change in any direction. Near by is a store and saloon under one\

        \ for want of a suitable designation, comprise the \"outfit \" of Sedan in\
        \ the line of architecture. THE TOWNSHIP. F. A. Stevens and Solomon Hobbs\
        \ were among the first settlers of this township, and Dr. J. H. Worthington,\
        \ who came in 1846, was the first regular physician to settle in the county.\
        \ The first birth in the township was that of Elizabeth Stevens, in April,\
        \ 1843. The first sermon preached in the vicinity was at the house of Eli\
        \ Ayers, by Rev. Isaac Newland, in 1844. The first mill was Michael Pilkey's,\
        \ built on Chariton River, in 1849. The first store was Daniel Castor's, in\
        \ the south part of the township, started in 1857, and Caldwell post office\
        \ was established the same year, T. B. Maring, Postmaster. The first school\
        \ taught was by D. T. Stevens, in 1849, in a cabin on the farm owned by F.\
        \ A. Stevens. Caldwell is the largest township in the county, and in area\
        \ of wooded land stands third. The township is thickly settled with an industrious\
        \ farming pop ulation, and the level vista of cultivated land stretching in\
        \ all directions is most agreeable to the traveler's eye. A society of Baptists\
        \ was formed in this township in 1860, the first mem bers being Dr. J. H.\
        \ and Martha Worthington, Lewis Harris and E. T. Stevens. Rev. John Osborn\
        \ was the organizing minister. The Pastors have been Rev. Messrs. Ogle, Gully,\
        \ Huckaby, Thomas A. Salladay, J. Kincaid, A. Jackson and J. Redburn. The\
        \ society meets at the schoolhouse in District No. 3, and has about forty\
        \ members. J. H. Worthington and J. Holman are the Deacons. Rev. J. Kincaid\
        \ is Superintendent of the Sabbath school, assisted by C. Meeker. R. Bennyfield\
        \ is Librarian, and the teachers are Mr. and Miss Meeker, Mrs. Worthington\
        \ and D. Stevens. About fifty pupils attend. The Methodists have a church-building\
        \ in the township, called \" Zoar Chapel,\" which was built many years ago.\
        \ Services are held here every third Sunday forenoon, and at the Johnson Schoolhouse\
        \ the same afternoon. A fine Sabbath school is maintained at Zoar Chapel,\
        \ of which David Stevens was Superintendent during the past summer. MILLEDGEVILLE.\
        \ (Independence Township.) Milledgeville is situated on the northeast quarter\
        \ of the southwest quarter of Section 10, Township 70, Range 19, and was dedicated\
        \ to the public by Harrison Anderson, December 22, 1857. Seventeen of the\
        \ lots lying along Main street have a variation of 60\xB0 from the meridian,\

        \ on his favourite subject of Indian art was in reference to the photograph\
        \ of the temple at Oodeypore now published1. Lastly I have to mourn the heavy\
        \ loss, still fresh in the mind of every Cambridge reader, of one of the most\
        \ trusty, most energetic, and most appreciative friends and supporters of\
        \ the present work, and, let me add, of the worker also. Under the auspices\
        \ of Henry Bradshaw, the greatest librarian of our time, it was my privilege\
        \ to commence my study of manuscripts. I shall never forget the sympathy,\
        \ and even enthusiasm with which he used to follow, in the minutest pal\xE6\
        ographical and chronological details, my endeavours to arrange the great Nepal\
        \ collection of our Library, nor my debt to him for many a hint and practical\
        \ direction in the work of re-arranging many masses of confused leaves and\
        \ in describing and registering the re-arrangement. I well remember a phrase\
        \ of his, used not without a touch of irony significant for us librarians\
        \ : \" My favourite occupation is putting rubbish in order.\" Though no professed\
        \ Orientalist, he had something to teach specialists in all branches. He had,\
        \ as many others can testify, a very strong sense of the value of our Oriental\
        \ collections, and not the least of that sent by Dr Wright from Nepal. My\
        \ proposal to visit that country found in him from the first one of its most\
        \ friendly and warmest supporters. I have seldom received more real encouragement\
        \ than from the expression of the genial and firm support that he was pleased\
        \ to give to my application to the Worts Fund on the occasion of its discussion\
        \ in the Arts School on 17 June 1884. Conscious as I am of the shortcomings\
        \ of the present work, I have no keener regret in connexion with it than that\
        \ it cannot be submitted to him at all events in its complete form, though\
        \ some of the first part was read in manuscript by him and has been in a few\
        \ places modified according to his suggestions. Yet it is some satisfaction\
        \ to know his opinion of my efforts, and of their possible results and development,\

        \ at home, but Pandit LTmeca candra Carina, the courteous librarian of the\
        \ Sanskrit College, Calcutta, pointed out to me that many of the best MSS.\
        \ were written, not on the leaf of the common talipot palm (talapattra), (Borassus\
        \ flabelliformis), but on the more finely grained leaf of the teret (Corypha\
        \ taliera and C. elata). In the Calcutta Museum, the arch\xE6ological part\
        \ of which has recently been admirably arranged and catalogued by the Curator,\
        \ Dr Anderson, I took copies of many of the unpub lished inscriptions ; but\
        \ I understand that they will shortly be dealt with by Mr J, F. Fleet in his\
        \ forthcoming volume on Gupta inscriptions. As to the specimen, of a hitherto\
        \ unnoticed character, coinciding with the writing of a unique MS. fragment\
        \ brought by me from Nepal, I may refer to my notes in Part II. \xA7 2 below\
        \ (Candravyakarana). These are given in anticipation of a fuller study of\
        \ this character,, which I propose to publish here after, since, as far as\
        \ I can judge at present, this discovery seems to be among the most interesting\
        \ of my journey. In the library of the Asiatic Society I examined the colophon\
        \ of the oldest of the MSS. sent from Nepal by Mr Hodgson. As mentioned in\
        \ one of the reviews (Athen\xE6um, Jan. 5, 1884) of the Society's recently\
        \ published catalogue of this collection, entitled Nepalese Buddhist Literature,\
        \ some misapprehension seemed to exist as to the date of this MS. The results\
        \ of my reading are given in Appendix III., in my supple mental table of kings\
        \ of Nepal, where the date and king's name well accord with chronological\
        \ results already established. I also took advantage of my stay in Calcutta\
        \ to read some portions of Sanskrit philosophical works, the full meaning\
        \ of which is rarely understood by European scholars unless they have had\
        \ the advantage of instruction derived directly or indirectly from the traditional\
        \ school of interpretation in India. In this matter and in many others I have\
        \ to acknowledge the very kind help of Professor Mahecacandra Nyayaratna,\
        \ Principal of the Government Sanskrit College. I was very glad to be able\
        \ to call myself his pragishya (pupil's pupil). Perhaps in this", 1]

        \ regime, as well as the losses since the appearance of Dr Hall's notes, which\
        \ form so excellent a basis for the philosophical portion of such a compi\
        \ lation. Besides much assistance generously rendei'ed by Pandit Dhundhiraja,\
        \ I received help in various ways from Dr Thibaut and Mr Venis of the Government\
        \ College; also from Pandit Vindhyecjvarlprasada, whose knowledge of bibliography\
        \ is excep tionally wide; and from Pandits Lakshminarayana Kavi and Sudhakara\
        \ Dube. The last named, who is the present librarian of the college, presented\
        \ me with copies of several of his astronomical and mathematical works, written\
        \ in Sanskrit. I am unfortunately not able to give an opinion on the scientific\
        \ value of these, but I have dejiosited them in the University Library in\
        \ the hope that they may be noticed, as I am informed by Dr Thibaut that Pandit\
        \ Sudhakara is a mathematician of considerable originality, and that his researches\
        \ deserve far more recognition than they have received, owing to his want\
        \ of command of literary English. Dr Thibaut adds that he is willing to translate\
        \ into English original papers by this pandit for reading before any suitable\
        \ scientific society in Europe. After some memorable days spent in Agra and\
        \ its neighbourhood, I passed on to Jeypore. Here I visited the very interesting\
        \ library of H. H. the Maharaja several times, permission \u2014 quite exceptional\
        \ I believe in the absence of the prince \u2014 being most kindly granted\
        \ me to visit it as often as I required. Some particulars as to this fine\
        \ collection are to be found in Dr Peterson's first Report (1S82 \u2014 83).\

        tSsMfs collection of antiquities has been made. The Museum is in one of the
        wings of the Court House, and is well worthy a visit. The society recently
        held its 33rd annual meet ing, when the following officers were elected :
        Messrs. T. D. Card, solr., chairman ; Robert Davidson, vice-chairman ; Thos.
        Robinson, secretary ; J. Walker, librarian, and Saml. Watt, curator. The Museum
        has a portrait, in oil, of Bishop Percy of Dromore, 1782-1811, a silk banner
        of the Loughbrick land Loyalists, 1782, lent by Miss Trevor ; an old musket
        stock and pike found in the Bann, 1863 ; a pike of 1798, dug up at the sinking
        of the foundations of the Bridge-street house, 1850 ; several bronze and stone
        celts ; flint and bronze arrow-heads ; pike-heads of 1798 ; cavalry buckles,
        Williamite period ; breast plates of Loughbrickland Volunteers, and Royal
        Castlewellan Infantry; Seapatrick Parish poor badge ; 2 brass Dutch snuff
        boxes, 1690 ; a cinerary urn found in a cairn on Decomet Mountain, 1873; three
        large blue, flowered, earthenware jugs, which belonged to the Banbridge Reading
        Society in 1795, pre sented by the representatives of the late Mr. Alexander
        M''Mullan, 1876. A case of prepared yarns and threads illustrates the improvements
        in flax manufacture. A number of steel engrav ings, dated 1783, illustrate
        the primitive methods of flax cultiva tion, preparation and manufacture at
        Scarva. One ol the series, dedicated to Viscount Dungannon, presents a view
        of Banbridge as it appeared in 1783. It shows the old Market House, which
        then stood upon the site of the Bridge-street Viaduct. A scene on market day
        represents a number of men in old-fashioned costume, selling brown linens
        to bleachers similarly habited. In addition to the collection of antiquities
        belonging to the county, the museum cases are fairly well supplied with exhibits
        of miscellaneous character from Eastern and Western countries. At a period
        when the Bann was not utilized for power purposes, it was famous throughout
        Ireland for its pearl fisheries. A species of mussel, very large in size,
        throve well in its waters, especially in the vicinity of Banbridge, and produced

        it has been measured off, avill be found accompanying a communication, avhich
        I shall address to the Secretary of War, upon the subject. "On the morning
        of the 26th inst., information was communicated to me that a number of persons
        avho avere desirous of leaving the Territory were unable to do so, and considered
        themselves to be unlaavfully restrained of their liberties. Hoavever desirous
        of conciliating public opinion, I felt it incumbent upon me to adopt the most
        energetic measures to ascertain the truth or falsehood of this statement.
        Postponing, therefore, a journey of importance which I had in con templation
        to one of the settlements of Utah County, I caused public notice to be given
        immediately of my readiness to relieve all persons who avere, or deemed themselves
        to be, aggrieved, and on the ensuing day, which was Sunday, requested a notice
        to the same effect to be read, in my presence, to the people in the tab ernacle.

        registered no less than 56 men, 38 women and 71 children, as desirous of my

        of these people are of English birth, and state that they leave the congregation

        was entirely covered in with canvas, which diminished its size to a singular
        degree ; whilst the daylight fell with dreary coldness through the windows
        above the flies and over the gallery. Men were rolling down heavy drop-scenes
        from the top, the coulisses not being able to afford accommodation to flats
        in more senses than one ; women were at work upon clouds and fountains that
        were placed about the stage ; carpenters were sawing out the borders of some
        cut forest or statue ; and, in the midst of it all, one of the ruling powers
        of the ballet, with a violin in his hand, was giving a lesson to a Terpsichorean
        divinity, in very short petti coats and a morning promenade-cape over her
        shoulders, who looked something like one of the antithetical combinations
        pro duced by those dissected cards, whereby all sorts of heads and bodies
        can be made to fit together. Wending his way amidst a labyrinth of side-scenes

        which he presumed was going to the scene of harmony, and at length got safely

        may almost be termed obscura as well, appropriated as the green-room to the

        more than ornament. The walls are adorned with slight extempore cartoons by
        occasional idlers ; the furniture con sists of four chairs and some side-scenes,

        \ at Datchet, and was perfectly acquainted with the view, proud of being able\
        \ to set the lecturer right. To this piece of gratuitous information succeeded\
        \ a scuffle in the dark, between the usher and Master Wheeler, together with\
        \ an extempore discussion upon the subject of academical discipline as connected\
        \ with the cane ; one party demonstrating it practically, and the other objecting\
        \ to it theoretically. Order being restored, a few more scenes were exhibited\
        \ ; and Mr. Doo was just on the point of dissolving Milan Cathedral, which\
        \ he had designated as the new Houses of Parliament, into a view of the Thames\
        \ Tunnel, with a gentleman in a bright-blue coat walking up the centre, which\
        \ could not very well be mistaken for anything else, when a fresh disturbance\
        \ amongst the audience caused him to pause for an instant in his descriptions.\
        \ The lights were suddenly turned on, and the librarian of the insti tution\
        \ descended from the top bench of the theatre, and whispered something to\
        \ the vice-president. And then the vice-president's face betrayed much astonishment,\
        \ and he cast a severe and scrutinizing glance first at Mr. Ledbury, and then\
        \ at Mr. Doo, who had pulled up the transparent screen to see what was the\
        \ matter ; after which he begged the patience of the audience for a few seconds,\
        \ and left the lecture-room. All this was so very mysterious that the curiosity\
        \ of the company was excited in a most singular manner ; and this was not\
        \ lessened when the vice president reappeared, ushering two policemen into\
        \ the theatre \u2014 not common, rustic constables, but real London alphabetical\
        \ policemen, with the proper badges round their arms, and shiny tops to their\
        \ hats. These individuals were at first presumed to have something to do with\
        \ the entertainments of the evening by the majority of the spectators, who\
        \ were, however, undeceived when the officers advanced towards Mr. Doo, and\
        \ one of them said with much suavity : ' I must trouble you, sir, to come\
        \ along with us.' The whole transaction was so rapid that, before Mr. Ledbury\
        \ and the rest of the audience had recovered from their surprise,", 1]
    - ["THE ADVENTURES OF MR. LEDBURY. 244 Oxygen\u2014 the universal sheet-anchor\
        \ of all lectures at scientific institutions \u2014 was the first element\
        \ chosen by Mr. Doo for his experiments ; and, to give proper effect to them,\
        \ the lights were put half down by the librarian, who sat in the corner of\
        \ the room, and turned a handle connected with the gas-meter. First of all,\
        \ Mr. Doo lighted a match, which he blew out, and introduced into a bottle\
        \ of gas, when it was immediately rekindled with a vivid flame. This was much\
        \ applauded ; but when he inserted a piece of incandescent charcoal into another\
        \ bottle, which sparkled into a thousand coruscations, like a brilliant squib,\
        \ the delight of the boys was so great that they could not contain their approbation,\
        \ until sundry cuffs and boxes from the usher resounded through the semi-obscurity\
        \ of the lecture-room. Upon this, order was once more restored, and they were\
        \ again quiet, except Master Wheeler, an ill-conducted lad, who, having first\
        \ imitated the ascent of a sky-rocket with his mouth, and next thrown a piece\
        \ of chewed paper at Mr. Ledbury's spectacles, was finally discovered, and\
        \ treated with several whacks of a cane across the shoulders as a preliminary\
        \ to further punishment when he got home ; which, however, did not prevent\
        \ him from kissing his hand the next minute to the half-boarder at Theresa\
        \ House ; in which rude act he was detected by the English teacher, who immediately\
        \ desired Miss Chapman, the half-boarder in question, to come and sit by her\
        \ side, where she remained, in extreme surveillance, during the remainder\
        \ of the lecture. Hydrogen was next touched upon by Mr. Doo, who, with the\
        \ assistance of Mr. Ledbury, inflated a small balloon over the gas pipe, which\
        \ ascended rapidly to the ceiling, and there kept stationary, and from which\
        \ no looks nor intimidations could with draw the eyes of the boys, who gazed\
        \ at it unceasingly, to sec what it would do next. This led to a short dissertation\
        \ upon atmospheric voyages ; and Mr. Doo drew the attention of the audience\
        \ to a diagram somewhat resembling a flying wheelbarrow, which he said was\
        \ a machine of his own invention for aerial travelling ; and when he explained\
        \ its manner of action, it appeared in every way worthy of Mr. Doo's peculiar\
        \ talents ; and perfectly convinced Mr. Ledbury, in his enthusiasm, that the\
        \ ingenious projector, in spite of the many skilful and renowned people who\
        \ bore his name, was the greatest Doo that had ever lived. ' It is impossible,'\
        \ said the supposed professor, ' to form the least idea of the triumphs in\
        \ celestial science which this apparatus will achieve. The moon will become\
        \ another portion of our boundless empire ; and all the twinkling stars \u2014\

    - ["HE BECOMES A PROFESSOR. 243 When the applause had subsided, after Mr. Doo\
        \ had bent several times very gracefully to the company, he commenced the\
        \ lecture with an easy assurance, at which Mr. Ledbury was per fectly astonished.\
        \ After a short, preliminary address, in which he spoke of the sun of knowledge\
        \ dispelling the mists of ignorance, through the medium of institutions like\
        \ the present, at which the committee looked very approvingly, as well as\
        \ hinted at the proud star that Clumpley had become in the scientific hemisphere,\
        \ since it had sent a representative to cat and drink at the British Association,\
        \ and paralyze that learned body by his paper in section Q, upon ' The Totality\
        \ of Dependence in Phrenology and Fireworks upon Metaphysical Electricity,'\
        \ wherein such powerful arguments were adduced in support of the theory, that\
        \ no one was able to refute them in the slightest manner \u2014 after this,\
        \ he proceeded to state that he should divide the lecture into two parts ;\
        \ the first con sisting of various experiments with the gases and other agents,\
        \ and the second comprising the celebrated Dissolving Views. He also added,\
        \ that as he should need some trifling assistance in the course of his experiments,\
        \ he was happy to see in front of the table a talented gentleman of his acquaintance\
        \ \u2014 Professor Ledbury of the learned societies \u2014 whose valuable\
        \ aid he should be too happy to secure. Mr. Ledbury started, and turned very\
        \ red, when he first heard his name mentioned ; but, calculating upon distinguishing\
        \ himself, which was always a great point with him, he yielded to Mr. Doo's\
        \ solicitations, and took his place at his side amidst the applause of the\
        \ audience, to whom he made an imposing obeisance. And indeed, as Emma remarked\
        \ to Mr. Wilmer \u2014 who felt much temporary gratification at their visitor\
        \ being so celebrated a person \u2014 with his spectacles and mild ex pression\
        \ of countenance, he looked very like a philosopher. On the table in front\
        \ of Mr. Doo was a large array of wide mouthed stoppered bottles, apparently\
        \ full of nothing, but which in reality contained various gases, that he had\
        \ been preparing in the lecturer's room during the day, in a mysterious manner\
        \ ; and by the aid of sundry gun-barrels, wash-tubs, and bladders, to the\
        \ intense bewilderment of the librarian, who could not conceive what they\
        \ were intended for ; but settled it at last by putting down Mr. Doo as the\
        \ Wizard of the North getting ready the celebrated gun-delusion, of which\
        \ he was more firmly convinced when that gentleman drew a union-jack handkerchief\
        \ from his pocket, and asked the librarian if he could procure him a guinea\
        \ pig or a small rabbit, all of which things, he was aware, were in great\

        \ by a bang, which shook the building to its very foundation, scared the astounded\
        \ audience. Mr. Doo leapt with convulsive energy to the other side of the\
        \ table ; Mr. Ledbury was knocked backwards into a large tub of water which\
        \ answered the purpose of a pneumatic trough ; and the librarian, who directed\
        \ the gas, turned it suddenly off in his fright, amidst the screams of the\
        \ young ladies, the huzzas of the boys\u2014 who thought it was part of the\
        \ experiment, and took advantage of the dark to kick up what noise they liked,\
        \ without fear of discovery \u2014 and the general bewilderment of the whole\
        \ assembly. The greatest confusion ensued, and the professor for some time\
        \ vainly endeavoured to make himself heard amidst the tumult. At length a\
        \ light was obtained from a spirit-lamp that was burning upon the table, and\
        \ the gas was soon rekindled, when the com pany were reassured, seeing Mr.\
        \ Ledbury and the professor still alive, and not blown into small fragments\
        \ as they had anticipated, but in full possession of their energies \u2014\
        \ the former gentleman wringing his coat-tails, and Mr. Doo preparing to address\
        \ the assembly. A few words explained the accident, in which it appeared that\
        \ the lecturer, instead of carbonic acid, had confided a bottle of oxy-hydrogen\
        \ gas to Mr. Ledbury's care, which, being highly explosive, had gone off so\
        \ unexpectedly, but fortunately without any ill effects. The table was, however,\
        \ thrown into so much confusion that it was thought advisable to conclude\
        \ the first portion of the lecture, and go on to the dissolving-views, the\
        \ indulgence of the audience being claimed for ten minutes, in ore* .r to\
        \ make the necessary preparations ; and then the professor and his assistant\
        \ retired into the lecturer's room, and the vice president went to inquire\
        \ about the health of the Fitzfabrics after the alarm. ' Well, Mr. Ledbury,\
        \ and how are you ?' asked Roderick, as they closed the door after them. '\
        \ I was surprised to see you. You were equally surprised to see me in such\
        \ a position, I have no doubt ; but I am always happy to lend my poor abilities\

        \ principal features of the evening's lecture. As they approached the Institution,\
        \ they perceived a great throng of company wending their way towards it, most\
        \ of whom were greeted by Mr. Wilmer and his family. First of all came up\
        \ the young ladies from Theresa House Academy, on the old London road, walking\
        \ two and two, and admitted upon payment of sixpence each, when they displayed\
        \ the most extraordinary diplomacy in getting as far away from the teachers\
        \ as they could. Then arrived the preparatory school for young gentlemen from\
        \ six to twelve, who entered somewhat less orderly, and divided the hour usually\
        \ appointed to the lectures into ten minutes of attention, ten minutes of\
        \ wriggling about, ten minutes of squabbling sotto voce, and the remaining\
        \ half-hour in sleep. The seats on the first row were reserved for the committee\
        \ and their friends, most of whom were present, including the Wilmer detachment\
        \ of spectators ; and the body of the lecture- room was filled with those\
        \ who were subscribers, as well as many other visitors who were not. The museum\
        \ and library had been brushed up, and set off to the best advantage by the\
        \ indefatigable librarian, who was now taking the tickets, to entice new supporters,\
        \ and the table in the lecture-room was covered with a new green baize, bound\
        \ with yellow, and presented by the ladies of Clumpley, on which were displayed\
        \ all the apparatus for the lecture, some of which were so singular in appearance,\
        \ that the less-informed of the company were for a time divided in their opinions\
        \ as to whether they had come to see an exhibition of conjuring or philosophy.\
        \ And after these curious things, the chief objects of attention were Emma\
        \ Ledbury and Titus ; who, being strangers, were therefore capable of producing\
        \ a great sensation in a country place like Clumpley, not exceeded by the\
        \ emotion caused when the Fitzfabrics \u2014 the great people of the village,\

        \ that Harry had purchased at a fair at Ashton. There were now to be seen\
        \ a few pictures upon the walls that were before so bare. Certainly they were\
        \ not sporting pictures, nor suggestive of \u25A0\" love's young dream.\"\
        \ One picture represented a jolly looking young woman who was very stout,\

        the transportation of supplies was proportionately slower. The difficulty
        of trans porting armies, with their subsistence, to the frontier of such domains,
        might well appal a statesman. The feasibility of even a wagon-road to the

        lines of railroad should cross the Rocky Mountains, and half a dozen span
        the great plains? It is true that at that time a transcontinental railroad
        was widely discussed, but it was from a wholly specu lative standpoint. With

        Government of the United States to make railroads beyond St. Louis when the
        people shall have completed roads from New York to St. Louis or the Missis
        sippi River. . . . Such a railroad will be, but not within forty years." There
        was just one thing that prevented the accom plishment of this prediction,
        and of it no one dreamed then. It was the mineral wealth of the Rocky Mountains.
        Without it there had not been a rail laid in the mountains to-day. Nevertheless,
        John Plumbe had begun his survey of a road from Lake Michigan to the Pacific
        in 1836, fifteen years be fore a road reached Chicago, had received aid from
        Congress in 1838, and was still appealing to the people to buy stock long
        after the above extract was written. As to the value of the territory to be
        acquired or held, the popular notion of the country east of the mountains
        has been mentioned. In regard to Texas, it was contended by those who opposed
        the annexation that the country was not worth enough to compensate us for
        her debt of $10,000,000, which we were to assume. The country west of the
        mountains was generally estimated a desert. In the year 1839 Robert Green

        young seamen is tailoring, and almost every man can therefore make his own
        clothes. But naturally there are some who have a greater gift that way than
        others, and these are able to lend a helping hand to their shipmates in cutting
        out or embroidering, or in fitting bright fancy linings to their caps, or
        sleeves of jackets. Any little distinctive mark which will not interfere with
        a man''s regulation uniform, such as these individual decorations, a blue
        jacket is very fond of. On this afternoon then, the men get out their clothes''
        bags and overhaul them. But besides his black sack-like bag of clothes, (each
        of which is numbered, and stowed away when not being used in racks along the
        flats,) the seaman has also his " ditty box," something like a small writing
        desk only of plain white deal. He carries the key on his knife lanyard, and
        the box itself is kept stowed between the beams over his mess. It is the only
        place a sailor has under lock and key ; there he keeps his needles and thread,
        his buttons, his money and his letters, the photograph of his mother and sister,
        or sweetheart ; all his little home relics and any small gifts he may be bringing
        home from foreign parts. If, therefore, you go forward between tlie hours
        of 2 and 4 p.m. on a Thursday you will find all the men more or less thus
        engaged. On the upper deck some will be sitting or lying on the hatchways,
        doing a bit of sewing at their clothes; others will be reading well-thumbed
        copies of favourite books from the ship''s library, or popular tales lent

        smoking. DoAvn below on the mess deck others again are grouped around the

        broad terraces or steps from the sea. On the coast the uplands average not
        more than 200 feet, fifty miles inland comes the broad terrace of the Lange
        Berge, then 100 miles fiom the sea the great ridge of the Black Mountains,
        averaging 3,000 feet in height. Beyond them extends the table-land of the
        Karroo (or " dry " land), Avhich is supposed to be the bed of a large ancient
        lake. Further inland this rises again into another plateau by the Orange River,
        until it dies away into the great table-land of the interior of South Africa,
        at an average height above the sea of 4,000 feet. There is a marked difference
        between the climate of the east and west coasts ; the winter of the west is
        wet and inclement, that of the east cold, dry, and bracing ; the summer of
        the Avest is dry and salubrious, that of the east wet and stormy. South Africa

        \ cottage in the grounds, had a game of lawn tennis, and enjoyed ourselves\
        \ in the tanks and bath-rooms, for there seemed abundance of water everywhere.\
        \ The temperature was much lower than down at Colombo. After dinner (to which\
        \ came the Bishop) the Perahara or proces sion of elephants began through\
        \ the garden and up the broad open drive in front of the house. There were\
        \ about fifty of these, and they advanced in the moonlight up from the Dalada\
        \ Maligawa, or great temple of the tooth, with many torches and tom-toms,\
        \ acrobats, Kandian chiefs, devil-dancers, umbrella and fan-bearers. Each\
        \ village chief in the procession had a little group of these dancers and\
        \ tom-toms, and there were giant dolls from twelve to fifteen feet high, and\
        \ strange forms of geese and other creatures carried in the procession. They\
        \ took a long time in passing, as we fed the elephants with sugar-cane and\
        \ several groups of the devil-dancers stopped to perform. One very old chief\
        \ was specially introduced to us by the Governor ; he had taken part in the\
        \ same sort of procession when the Prince of Wales was here. At about 11 p.m.\
        \ we walked through the grounds to Mr. Templer's, the Government agent's house,\
        \ where we saw the remains of the old palace of the Kandian kings and the\
        \ audience-hall with its carved wooden pillars and dark brown roof, and so\
        \ on to the great octagon temple of the Dalada Maligawa, one of the most sacred\

        \ halls were filled with yellow-robed, clean-shaven Buddhist monks, with every\
        \ expression of character on their faces and of every age, from old men down\
        \ to quite young boys of sixteen. We first went into the library and saw the\
        \ Pitakas, and the books of the ordination service, most of them written on\
        \ flat strips of thin wood about two and a half inches broad and from one\
        \ to two feet long : each separate book being a pile of these bound together\
        \ by silken strings which pass round the thicker bocards which form the top\
        \ and lowest layers. There are 900 volumes here and some of them have never\

        \ with much grace, it became very popular, and the panegyric on Phalaris induced\
        \ the scholars of Christ Church, Oxford, to issue a new edition, under the\
        \ charge of the Hon. Charles Boyle. While it was passing through the press\
        \ a quarrel arose between Mr Boyle and the King's Librarian, Richard Bentley,\
        \ the greatest of European scholars. Boyle, in his preface to the Epistles,\
        \ had the temerity to attack the celebrated critic, who revenged himself by\
        \ convincingly demonstrating that the Epistles were forgeries, and not particularly\
        \ skilful ones. You will find his learned argument prefixed to the 1697 edition\
        \ of William Wotton's Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning. Bentley,\
        \ as might be expected, treated Temple, whose scholarship was of the petit\
        \ maitre order, with scant re spect ; but the retired diplomatist was too\
        \ shrewd to cross swords with so formidable an adversary. Christ Church, however,\
        \ supplied him with a defender. A reply appeared \u2014 bearing the name of\
        \ Boyle, but really written by Atterbury, with the assistance of some fellow-under\
        \ graduates. It was entitled Dr Bentley's Dissertations on the Epistles of\
        \ Phalaris, and the Fables of \xC6sop, Exa mined (1698). Macaulay characterises\
        \ it as a remarkable book, which reminds one of Goldsmith's observation that\
        \ the French would be the best cooks in the world if they had any butcher's\
        \ meat, for they can make two dishes out of a nettle-top. It really deserves\
        \ the praise, whatever that praise may be worth, of being the best book ever\
        \ written by any man on the wrong side of a question of which he was profoundly\
        \ ignorant. It was then that Swift bestrode the battered body of his patron,\

        and its privileges were open to both sexes. Mrs. William Tweeddale was elected
        presi dent, and served in that capacity till 1875. After the incorporation,
        the library was reopened in rooms provided for it in the second story of a
        building at No. 211 Kansas avenue, where it re mained till the 10th of September,
        1874. At that time it was removed to the second story of a build ing at the
        northeast corner of Kansas avenue and Seventh street, where it had much better
        rooms than at any time before, and sufficient reading-room space. The revenues
        of the library were derived from the tax of $3.00 a year for membership, social
        en tertainments and occasional donations; and these were generally sufficiently
        large to enable the di rectors to pay rent, services of librarian and other
        contingent expenses, and from the surplus to make frequent additions to their
        stock of books. In January7, 1875, it had 1,766 volumes, and a weekly issue
        of 100 books. At that time Mr. E. Wilder was elected president, and by reelections
        from year to year he has continued to perform the functions of that office
        to the present time. At the beginning of the year 1877, the number of books
        had increased to 2,897. A desire had often been expressed by the direc tors
        and by the public, that the library should be made free, and to that end an
        appeal was made to a few liberally-disposed individuals to contribute money
        for that purpose, which resulted in a fund 21', 1]

        \ before he was presented to the living. For a considerable period previously\
        \ he had been librarian to the University of Glasgow, and had discharged his\
        \ duties with great punctuality. So rigid, indeed, was he in observing the\
        \ hours, and keeping by the rules, that I have heard Professor Wilson say\
        \ that if three o'clock (the hour for closing the library) struck while Mr\
        \ Pate was half-way down the ladder with a book for some student in waiting,\
        \ he would step up again and restore it to its place, when it would not have\
        \ taken half a minute more to have handed it to the expectant applicant. The\
        \ Professor had, however, a great regard for his old friend. The friendship\
        \ continued after he became minister of Innerleithen ; and I remember that\
        \ on one occasion, when proposing his health at a public dinner, the Professor\
        \ remarked, \u2014 \" The worst thing Mr Pate's enemies can say against him\
        \ is, that he is a dry stick ; but I am sure, if he is a stick at all, he\
        \ is one through whom flows the genuine sap of kind ness and hospitality.\"\
        \ Mr Pate's sermons, neatly composed, were written on long slips of paper\
        \ arranged in their proper order. When he had delivered the contents of one,\
        \ he slid it quietly down into the bottom of the pulpit, and then proceeded\
        \ to the next, \u2014 his idea being \u2014 a very groundless one \u2014 that\

        \ of De Bry's Peregrinationes (worth \xA3150), and all the most important\
        \ county histories, as Nicholl's Leicestershire, Surtees Durham, Baker's Northamptonshire,\
        \ Ormerod's Cheshire, &c. The collection of MSS. is a very valuable, though\
        \ little known, portion of the library. Besides 31 Oriental MSS. it contains\
        \ more than 150 volumes of European MSS., of which the_ greater number are\
        \ historical, genealogical and topographical, theological and ethical, and\
        \ scientific. Amongst the historical MSS. is a very rare (if not unique) and\
        \ valuable 14th century copy of the Flores Historiarum (now believed to be\
        \ the compilation, not of Matthew of Westminster, but of Matthew of Paris,\
        \ and perhaps, in part, of John of London), Higden's Polycronicon in English\
        \ (1 5th century), Robert Lindsay's Chronycle of Scotland, the Records of\
        \ Dunkeld, one of the series of \" Relations\" of the Venetian ambassadors\
        \ to England\u2014 that of Lando (1620-22), Henry Knyvett's Project for the\
        \ Defence of England, &c. (1596). The historical and genealogical MSS. relating\
        \ to Lancashire and Cheshire are choice and numerous. They include the collections\
        \ of Dr. Kuerden (2 vols.), John Palmer (8 vols.), Thomas Barritt (10 vols.),\
        \ the library of John Byrotn, the inventor of stenography, the collection\
        \ of those accom plished local antiquaries the late John Harland and Canon\
        \ Raines, &e, and many contain pedigrees, coats of arms of local and other\
        \ families, and several volumes are transcripts from Lancashire documeuts\
        \ iu the British Museum, Bodleian Library, Oxford, and the various depositories\
        \ of public records. The theological MSS. include a New Testament of the later\
        \ Wycliffe version (about 1430), a Bible of the Latin Vulgate (15th century),\
        \ a Hebrew Pentateuch en three rolls (leather), a Roman missal, a Roman psalter\
        \ from the monastery of Godstow, and various common-place books, &c. Among\
        \ the poetical MSS. are the \" Pricke of Conscience,\" by Richard Rolle, the\
        \ Hermit of Hampole ; various \"Miscellanies\" in verse, including a unique\
        \ copy of \" Torrente of Portyngale ; \" \"A Boke of Kervyng and Norture,\"\
        \ Sc. ; the Halliwell Collectiou of Broadsides (32 vols. sol.), including\
        \ 1,309 pieces of poetry and verse, ballads, &c, and 1,791 prose pieces, political,\
        \ commercial, legal broadsides, proclamations, &c. The catalogue of this library,\
        \ as it now exists, is the successive work of three periods, and of as many\
        \ gentlemen. In 1791 was printed a catalogue iu two volumes 8vo, entitled\
        \ \"Bibliotheca Chethamensis, sive Bibliothec\u0153 Public\xE6 Mancuniensis,\
        \ ab Humfredo Chetham Armigero fundat\xE6, Catalogus,\" compiled by the Uev.\
        \ John Radcliife, A.M., librarian. As frontispiece was prefixed to the first\
        \ volume an engraved portrait of the founder by Heath, from a drawing by Morland,\
        \ which is a copy of a fine portrait in oil in the reading-room. A third volume,\
        \ printed in 1826, contained a catalogue of the additional books during the\
        \ interval of thirty-five years, compiled by the Rev. William Parr GreBwell\
        \ ; and appended to these were three alphabetical indices, one to each volume\
        \ of the catalogue. Iu 1862 appeared a fourth volume of the catalogue, followed\
        \ in 1863 by a fifth, both compiled and edited by the late Mr. Thomas Jones,\
        \ B.A., F.S.A., the then librarian, including all the additional books during\
        \ a second interval of thirty-six years, and also an index (alphabetical by\
        \ authors' names) to all the books in these four volumes of the catalogue.\
        \ Of separate works (not volumes), Vol. I. includes books numbered consecutively\
        \ 1 t . 3,930 ; Vol. II. 3,931 to 6,723 ; Vol. III. 6,724 to 8,029 ; and Vol.\
        \ IV. 8,030 to 12,058. In 1791 the library contained, according to the catalogue,\
        \ 6,723 works ; in the next thirty-five years only 1,306 works were added\
        \ ; while in the thirty-six years ended 1862 4,030 works were added. In 1867\
        \ a supplementary index was published. The library, till a few years ago,\
        \ contained a number of antiquities and natural curiosities, which were exhibited,\
        \ with a description, bawled out in sonorous tones, to the discomfort of the\
        \ readers, by one of the blue-coat boys ; but the contents of this rude museum\
        \ of an older time have been removed to the Peel Park Museum, Salford, and\
        \ the readers are no longer disturbed by the inharmonious chantings of the\
        \ little showmen delivering their story by rote in the rich Doric of the Lancashire\
        \ folk-speech. Another custom is now \"more honour'd in the breach than the\
        \ observance : \" formerly the library was closed to the student during Whitsuntide\
        \ week, while it was thronged by several thousands of country visitors. Now\
        \ the gates are closed to the latter, and the library is open to students\
        \ only in the festive week. The estates purchased for the hospital out of\
        \ the sums bequeathed by the founder are situated at Sutton-on-the-Hill, in\
        \ the county of Derby, and at Rochdale, in the county of Lancaster; while\
        \ the farms, forming the investment for the aid of the library are situated\
        \ in the respective townships of Hammerton, Essington, and Stevenmore, in\
        \ the parish of Slaidburn in the county of York. Manchester and Salford are\
        \ rich in public charities. In addition to the foundations of Bishop Oldham\
        \ and Humphrey Chetham, and the exhibitions of Mr. Hulme, and numerous other\
        \ charities of more modern date, there are other funds for the use of the\
        \ poor to the amount of upwards of \xA34,000 a year. The distribution of many\
        \ of them was formerly confided to the borouo-hreeve of Manchester, hence\
        \ called the Boroughreeve's Charities (now to the Mayor, and called the Mayor's\
        \ Charities), and in 1792, Thomas Walker, Esq., boroughreeve, at the termination\
        \ of his year of office, published a list of these charities, which, as he\
        \ observes, was accurate as far as it proceeded, but was still deficient in\
        \ some particulars ; these particulars the commissioners appointed under the\
        \ Acts of the 58 Geo. III. and the 5 Geo. TV. have supplied. The following\
        \ will be found a tolerably complete enumeration of this description of charities\

        \ January 1, 1825, its first editor being Mr. Alaric A. Watts, who at that\
        \ early date was distinguished in the world of letters \u2014 the Courier\
        \ was subsequently issued as a bi-weekly, and since 1864 it has been published\
        \ daily ; the Examiner and Times first appeared under the title of the Manchester\
        \ Examiner, in 1848, as the organ of the advanced section of the Liberal party,\
        \ its editor at that time and until 1854 being Mr. Abraham Walter Paulton\

        \ issued from the Guardian office, and the Evening Mail, issued from the office\
        \ of the Courier. Besides these papers there are the Manchester City News,\
        \ devoted mainly to municipal and local and literary matters, the first number\
        \ of which appeared January 2, 1864 ; the Weekly Times, the Weekly Post, the\
        \ Salford Weekly News, the Salford Chronicle (weekly), the Alliance (total\
        \ abstinence organ, weekly), the Sporting Chronicle (daily), the Sunday Chronicle,\
        \ and the Umpire. Several minor periodicals were published here, and many\
        \ valuable works have been issued from the Manchester press.1 Among the principal\
        \ old Libraries of Manchester are Chetham's Library (already noticed) ; the\
        \ Manchester Circulating Library, instituted in 1756 ; the Royal Exchange\
        \ Library, estab lished by subscription in August, 1792, and having nearly\
        \ 20,000 volumes, was discontinued in 1867, when the books were sold ; and\
        \ the Portico Library, established January, 1806. This last is in an Ionic\

        \ the ground-floor 66 by 42 feet, with a gallery around containing the books,\
        \ an upper room, &c. It cost \xA37,000. The oldest subscription library, established\
        \ in 1765, ceased to exist in 1867, all its books being sold by auction. The\
        \ Incorporated Law Library, in Kennedy Street, consists entirely of professional\
        \ books, and is supported by professional gentle men. The Foreign Library,\
        \ 17, St. Ann Street, originated in 1830, and has a large number of volumes\
        \ in various languages. Of the more modern libraries the chief is the Manchester\
        \ Free Public Library, with its various branches \u2014 which owes its existence\
        \ to the late Sir John Potter's personal efforts in obtaining private subscriptions,\
        \ which eventually reached the large sum of \xA312,823, and to the valuable\
        \ aid of Dr. John Watts, by whose medium the Hall of Science in Camp Field\
        \ (built in 1839) was purchased for the Free Library. It was opened with a\
        \ public meet ing, &c, on the 9th June, 1852. It consisted chiefly of two\
        \ large rooms, the lower one being the lending library and the news and general\
        \ reading room ; the upper room contained the reference library (the books\
        \ of which are not allowed to circulate), with tables for the readers of books\

        \ too low, and the ventilation defective, whilst the reference library was\
        \ too remote from the centre of the city to be convenient for the class of\
        \ readers ordinarily making use of it. Another defect was that, being intended\
        \ for the holding of public meetings, it was not strong enough to bear the\
        \ solid weight of the books placed against the walls, and early began to show\
        \ signs of weakness. These continuing, it became necessary, for the public\
        \ safety, to close the library in April, 1877, when the books were removed\
        \ to the rooms in the rear of the old Town Hall, which had then lately been\
        \ vacated. The Council, by resolution (April 25, 1877), authorised the temporary\
        \ occupation of that building for the purposes of the reference library, but\
        \ finding, as a consequence of the more central situation, that the numbers\
        \ of readers had in a short time increased nearly four- fold, it was even\
        \ tually determined to make the building the permanent home of this department.\
        \ Branch lending libraries have been established in Deansgate, Rochdale Road,\
        \ Ancoats, Hulme, Rusholme Road, and Cheetham. In 1864 a catalogue of the\
        \ books in the Central Library, in the reference department only, compiled\
        \ by Mr. A. Crestadoro, Ph.D., principal librarian, was published in a thick\
        \ octavo volume, pp. 975), which shows that at that time the separate works\
        \ (not volumes), in that department alone, numbered 26,534. According to the\
        \ last yearly report i Amongst other periodicals may be named the Townsman\
        \ (1803-5), Manchester Magazine (1817), the Catholic (1822), the Phcenix (1822),\

    - ["THE HISTORY OF LANCASHIRE. 384 evening classes for both sexes. During its\
        \ first year its members averaged 444, mostly working people. The first exhibition\
        \ under its auspices was held in the National School, Union Street, at Christmas,\
        \ 1839-40. During 57 days upwards of 23,000 visitors inspected the large collection,\
        \ and it resulted in an addition to the funds of \xA355. At the close of its\
        \ first year the library contained 714 volumes, about 200 of which had been\
        \ presented by ladies and gentlemen of the town, the remainder being purchased\
        \ by the institution. In the following year female classes were established\
        \ under the charge of a committee of ladies. The ladies attended the classes\
        \ in turns. A second exhibition at Christmas, 1844-5, was not so successful\
        \ ; and the state of trade, with the long illness and death of its excellent\
        \ president, Mr. Nelson, left the institution in a very unsatisfactory position,\
        \ from which it was rescued by vigorous efforts of friends. New and more central\
        \ premises were obtained, and in 1845 the Lyceum was removed to Clegg Street,\
        \ near the Town Hall, where it remained until its final removal to the present\
        \ fine building. After the death of Mr. Nelson in 1846, the presidency of\
        \ the Lyceum was accepted by Mr. Nathan Worthington, whose energy and public\
        \ spirit contributed materially to raise the institution from its depressed\
        \ condition. At the annual meeting in February, 1848, Mr. Worthington retired\
        \ from the presidency, and was succeeded by Mr. James Platt, who continued\
        \ to preside over the institution until his deith in August, 1857, at which\
        \ period he was also member of Parliament for the borough. He conceived the\
        \ idea of erecting a new Lyceum ; and, to obtain the nucleus of a building\
        \ fund, a third exhibition, on a much more extensive scale, was projected,\
        \ and held iu the Working Men's Hall. On the 17th of July, 1854, the opening\
        \ ceremony was performed by the Earl of Wilton. A grand banquet was given\
        \ at the Town Hall, at which the Earl of Wilton, the Bishop of Manchester,\
        \ and other distinguished individuals were present. In collecting contributions\
        \ and arranging the exhibition upwards of \xA31,000 was expended. The working\
        \ expenses averaged nearly \xA330 per week. The contents were insured for\
        \ \xA325,000. As many as 9,571 persons were admitted, and as much as \xA3\
        300 taken at the doors in a single week, exclusive of 1,250 season-ticket\
        \ holders, many of whom visited the exhibition nearly every day. During the\
        \ entire season 14,700 cheap-trip visitors passed through the rooms. The single\
        \ admissions, exclusive of those by season tickets, amounted altogether to\
        \ about 100,000. The exhibition was open 18 weeks, closing on Saturday, 18th\
        \ November. The net profits of the undertaking were \xA32,155, of which \xA3\
        624 was realised by a bazaar got up by the ladies of Oldham, and held in the\
        \ exhibition during the first three days of the season. With the funds thus\
        \ obtained the Directors immediately set about the new building, which is\
        \ in the Italian style, from the plans gratuitously supplied by Mr. N. G.\
        \ Pennington, of Manchester. The foundation stone was laid on the 25th of\
        \ June, 1855, by the president, Mr. James Platt, assisted by the Oldham brethren\
        \ of the Ancient Order of Freemasons. Lord Stanley, Dr. Vaughan, and other\
        \ eminent friends of education were present, and a demonstration of public\
        \ sympathy was made on the occasion. After the stone was laid a banquet was\
        \ held in the Town Hall, at which subscriptions to the building fund, amounting\
        \ to \xA31,500, were announced. These were afterwards augmented to \xA31,920.\
        \ The building, furniture, additions to the library, &c, cost about \xA36,500.\
        \ It was opened with another demonstration on Monday, September 22, 1856,\
        \ the ceremony being performed by the president, who was again supported by\
        \ Lord Stanley and others of note. On removing to the new building, the Directors\
        \ arranged with the proprietors of the Queen Street Subscription Library for\
        \ the transfer to the Lyceum of the whole of their books, &c. The president\
        \ also, with his usual generosity, presented the institution with the Butterworth\
        \ Library. Mr. Platt was succeeded in the office of president of the Lyceum\
        \ by Mr. J. G. Blackburne, F.G.S. During 1858 an unsuccessful attempt was\
        \ made to set afoot a subscription for the liquidation of the debt upon the\
        \ building. At the annual meeting on Jan. 27, 1859, Mr. J. Platt offered to\
        \ give \xA3500 towards the projected liquidation fund, on the condition that\
        \ \xA32,000 more could be obtained iu the course of the year. The amount was\
        \ raised, and before the annual meeting in January, 1860, the mortgage and\
        \ interest were paid off, and the institution set once more free from all\
        \ its liabilities. The amount of the donations obtained by this last effort\
        \ was \xA32,537, which, with the \xA31,920 subscribed to the original building\
        \ fund, made the generous offerings of the public towards the institution\
        \ into a grand total of \xA34,458. The present handsome building is one of\
        \ the chief architectural ornaments of the town. It is well situated in Union\
        \ Street, and contains in the basement two large rooms for evening classes\
        \ ; on the principal floor in front, a good room for the library, which numbers\
        \ about 10,000 volumes ; and a spacious newsroom, erected by the Corporation\
        \ in 1880 ; and behind the library a reading-room, with magazines and periodicals.\
        \ On the first floor are the lecture-room, a clubroom, the directors' room,\
        \ and two private classrooms ; on the second floor, a billiard-room and a\
        \ large classroom ; on the third floor, a chemical laboratory, with ante-room\
        \ ; and in the cupola, which crowns the building, is placed a fine telescope.\
        \ School of Science and Art. \u2014 In 1863, Mr. John Platt offered to present\
        \ to the Lyceum an adequate stock of models, objects, and apparatus for a\
        \ School of Science and Art, such stock to be the permanent property of the\
        \ Lyceum, on condition that the Directors undertook to afford all the facilities\
        \ they could to persons in the district, whether members of the Lyceum or\
        \ not, who might wish to avail themselves of the advantages of the school.\
        \ He further promised to engage a first-class master, and to pay whatever\
        \ was required, in excess of the fees, to the master. In consequence of this\
        \ munificent offer, a School of Science and Art, in connection with the Lyceum,\
        \ was erected. Classes in mechanical and machine drawing, freehand drawing,\
        \ chemistry, &c, have been established under efficient teachers, and the results,\
        \ as shown by the Government science examination, have exceeded the expectations\
        \ of the committee. The building, a handsome one of ornamental brick, with\

        \ The chromatic decoration of the Gothic palaces of Venice was of course founded\
        \ on these two great principles, which prevailed constantly wherever the true\
        \ chivalric and Gothic spirit possessed any influence. The windows, with their\
        \ intermediate spaces of marble, were considered as the objects to be relieved,\
        \ and variously quartered with vigorous color. The whole space of the brick\
        \ wall was considered as a background ; it was covered with stucco, and painted\
        \ in fresco, with diaper patterns. \xA7 xxx. What ? the reader asks in some\
        \ surprise, \u2014 Stucco ! and in the great Gothic period ? Even so, but\
        \ not stucco to imitate stone. Herein lies all the difference ; it is stucco\
        \ con fessed and understood, and laid on the bricks precisely as gesso is\
        \ laid on canvas, in order to form them into a ground for receiving color\
        \ from the human hand, \u2014 color which, if well laid on, might render the\

        \ ground in no wise adds to the value of the picture. A Tintoret on beaten\
        \ gold would be of no more value than a Tintoret on coarse canvas ; the gold\
        \ would merely be wasted. All that we have to do is to make the ground as\
        \ good and fit for the color as possible, by whatever means. \xA7 xxxi. I\

        \ page of a book to be illuminated : but he will understand also that the\

        \ fade or to fall, the unsighttiness of the defaced color would necessitate\
        \ its immediate restoration ; and that therefore, of all the chromatic decoration\

        \ he would not drink a Jacobite toast on his bare knees, as was then no uncommon\
        \ custom amongst the friends of the exiled family, of which, till a late date,\
        \ there were many in the Old Town and county. Whether the story be true or\
        \ not, he now took up his resi dence in Cambridge, and was a scholar of mark\
        \ there for many years, and officiated as Librarian and Registrar of the University.\
        \ It is not necessary here to mention his various works, which will be found\
        \ in the ' Anecdotes ' by Mr. Bowyer and in the pleasant sketch derived from\
        \ them in good Arch deacon Owen's pages. It may be enough to mention that\
        \ his ' Lysias ' was published in London 1739, and in 1740, when he took his\
        \ LL.D., he read the celebrated Commentarius ad Legem Decemviralem de inope\
        \ debitore in partes dissecando, showing that it was his property, and not\
        \ the debtor himself, which was to be cut to pieces. It was published in 1742,\
        \ in which year he was admitted of Doctors' Commons, but never appears to\
        \ have practised as a lawyer. In the next year (1743) he pub lished the well-known\
        \ Marmor Saudz'icense brought by the Earl of Sandwich from Athens, and in\
        \ the same year Orationes du\xE6, una Demosthenis contra Midiam, altera Lycurgi\
        \ contra Leocratem, &c. In the year 17.44, through the kindness of his patron,\

        \ Bishop \u2014 as we pick up from what is called the in troduction to the\
        \ third volume of his ' Demosthenes ' \u2014 he suc ceeded Dr. Reynolds as\
        \ Chancellor of the Diocese of Lincoln. I do not think that the date of his\
        \ entering holy orders is exactly known, for some time subsequent to this\
        \ date he was busy on his edition of ' Demosthenes,' which he never lived\
        \ to complete. The third volume just alluded to came out in the spring of\
        \ 1748, the first being deferred in order that he might, with more leisure,\
        \ complete the ' Prolegomena ' and the ' Life.' But though the exact date\
        \ of his entering holy orders may not be known we do know that in 1749 he\
        \ printed a sermon ; that in 175 1 he succeeded Dr. Christopher Anstey in\
        \ the rectory of Lawford, Essex, a St. John's living, which was the probable\
        \ cause of his leaving the civil law for the Church ; and in 1753 became Archdeacon\

    - ['THE REIGN OF GEORGE THE SECOND. 15 What is called the Taylor MS. in the School
        Library has no reference whatever to the classical annotations above alluded
        to. It is a local document (much used by our his torians) extending from 1372
        to July 25, 1603. It was prob ably compiled by some of the Lyster family of
        Rowton Castle, and was given to Dr. Taylor, when Fellow of St. John''s, by
        Richard Lyster, Esq., who, from having been so long member, went by the name
        of '' The Senator.'' In referring to Taylor''s books which passed into the
        hands of Dr. Askew, the rare folio Terentianus Maurus, Mediolani, 1477, deserves
        mention. He gave four guineas for it out of the Harleian Collection. It was
        bought for twelve by Dr. Hunter on the sale of Askew''s library, and was in
        the Hun terian Collection. Bowyer gave the following note in MS. written by
        Taylor himself : '' This is judged to be the only copy of this edition in
        England, if not in the whole world. If so, it is worth any money. Dr. Askew
        could find no copy in his travels over Europe, though he made it his earnest
        and particular search in every library which he had an oppor tunity of consulting.''
        It was probably the name of Taylor which induced Leonard Hotchkis, some time
        Fellow of St. John''s, and a master of Shrewsbury School, to give his atten
        tion to the work of Terentianus Maurus. The book is by no means so rare as
        Dr. Taylor thought. I conclude this little notice with an amusing anecdote.
        Taylor, as librarian, had to arrange and class the books given by George I.
        to the University of Cambridge, formerly be longing to Bishop Moore, and he
        states that, '' throwing the books into heaps for general divisions, he saw
        one whose title-page mentioned somewhat of height and another of salt ; the
        first he cast amongst those of mensuration, the other to those of chemistry
        or cookery ; that he was startled, when he came to examine them, to find that
        the first was Longinus'' " De Sublimitate," and the other a theological discourse
        on the Salt of the World that good Christians ought to be seasoned with.''
        I can have no doubt but that dear old Bishop Butler enjoyed this much. But

        \ city and maintained by public taxation, is situated on Grand Avenue, between\
        \ Fourth and Fifth Streets. The foundation of the library was laid as early\
        \ as 1847 by the \\oung Men's Association, which accumulated a collection\
        \ of about 10,000 volumes and circu lated them among the members of the association\
        \ until 1878, when its property was transferred to the city as a free gift.\
        \ Since that time, the number and value of the books has been constantly growing,\
        \ until it now contains nearly 36,000 volumes in all departments of literature.\
        \ The use of all the books within the building is open to everybody, as also\
        \ is the Reading Room, while the withdrawal of books for home use is restricted\
        \ to actual residents, but may be accorded to temporary visitors in the city\
        \ on condition of a small deposit with the librarian, which is returned when\
        \ these privileges are surrendered. The Readin\xBB Room is an unusually pleasant\
        \ and cheerful room, and contains files of the leading European and American\
        \ journals and daily papers from all the large cities of the Union, to the\
        \ unrestricted use of which all strangers are invited during the regular library\
        \ hours, from 9 A. M. to 9 P. M. A more scholarly, cordial mannered gentleman\
        \ than the present librarian, Mr. K. A. Linderfelt, is rarely found in such\
        \ a position. The east side line of cars takes you nearly to the Water-works\
        \ Park and pumping works at the North Point, which every visitor should see.\
        \ The view over the lake from the park is superb, and a passing look should\
        \ be given the mons ter Corliss engine, (which far exceeds in capacity the\
        \ one so much vaunted and admired at the Centen nial at Philadelphia) ever\
        \ ceaselessly and silently pumping the water to the watertower on the top\
        \ of the high bluff behind it. When the engineer in charge tells you, that\
        \ the engine was built in Mil waukee, at the Allis works, and that the Water\
        \ Tower was designed by C. A. Gombert, a Milwaukee architect, your interest\
        \ in the city and its people in creases. From whatever view the Water Tower\
        \ is seen, whether a mere tall speck on the horizon miles away, from any of\
        \ the points of view around Library Building, Grand Avenue, Between Fourth\
        \ and Fifth Sts. the city, or at its foot at any time of day, the handsome\
        \ grey monument, in shadow or sunshine, is always beautiful. The tourist who\
        \ returns from Europe after gazing at the triumphal columns of the slayers\
        \ of men, the Trajans, Nelsons, and restored Vendome, never fails to admire\
        \ \"The Monument to Cleanliness,\" the utilitarian, and eminently American\
        \ column of the Northwest \u2014 The Water Tower of Milwaukee ! A short distance\
        \ along the Lake Shore, if the day is fine and you are disposed for a walk,\
        \ you will find the Industrial School, St. Mary's Hospital, St. Joseph's Asylum,\
        \ and the Government Lighthouse. Visible miles away over the waters, in winter's\
        \ storm and summer's calm, the flash-light of Milwaukee has cheered many a\
        \ heart with its brightness, though appearing but a moment in the darkness,\
        \ to re-appear again, if earnestly watched for. Away off, on the other or\
        \ south side of the bay, on Jones' Island, is the Life Saving Station, a visit\
        \ to which will well repay you, especially if you are not used to the ways\
        \ of \"Men who go down to the sea in ships.\" Quiet, modest, and retiring,\
        \ unless the moment occurs to prove what they are made of, you will find the\
        \ men of the life saving station ready to welcome you, and show the government\
        \ apparatus in their care. When ordinary humanity shrinks back, calmly, never\
        \ losing a chance in their favor by ex citement, they have again and again\
        \ risked their own lives to rescue those unknown to them. The simple record\
        \ of \"lives lost in service,\" is their Book of Martyrs. Among the noticeable\
        \ buildings are the Court House, built of red sandstone from Lake Superior,\
        \ and St. Paul's Church, constructed of the same material. The windows in\
        \ the latter edifice are especially beau-", 2]

        \ in these days of railroad construc- tion and land speculation, that it has\
        \ become a matter of common occurrence to lay out and build cities in pursuance\
        \ of a preconceived plan, and at such places as common consent or indi- vidual\
        \ shrewdness deter- mines to be an eligible situation for a prospective ilogous\
        \ instances of cities, ice on solid ground, natural nations, the one powerful\
        \ ely built communities was, n, either by uniting their 3 of a powerful lord.\
        \ Thus lmost every city of import- il lordly mansion or to the :udal castle\
        \ once raised its rrets toward the sky, far proximity to the arm that was\
        \ to guard them against the raids of neighboring robber barons. The same thing\
        \ has been repeated on a smaller scale in this country, where the rude block-house\
        \ or palisaded wooden fort, built as an advance post in the domain of native\
        \ Indians, to serve as a protection against expected attacks, often formed\
        \ the nucleus of a settlement, which gradually extended in ever widening circles,\
        \ while, at the same time, it condensed in its center to a village, that ultimately\
        \ gained the dignity of a city. There are those cities, however, which count\
        \ their origin not from the more or less elaborate abode of grim war, but\
        \ from the rude chapel and roughly hewn cross of the early missionary who\
        \ risked his life for the spiritual welfare of his savage brother of the forest.\
        \ A still larger portion of our western cities have no other beginning than\
        \ the humble dwelling, around which a solitary back woodsman cleared a small\
        \ space, to plant his scanty stores of seed and grain, or where an adventurous\
        \ trader of the early days spread out his wares, to barter with his dusky\
        \ neighbors for the gain of their hunting expeditions. To the last class belongs\
        \ Milwaukee, and its peaceful beginning is an epitome of its whole subsequent\
        \ history. It can point to no ruin of castle or fort ; there is no field or\
        \ hill, copse or creek of which it can be said that there raged once a battle,\
        \ whether between civilized or savage foes; only the occasional chronicler\
        \ knows who built the fir6t church; and an ordinary city business block covers\
        \ the spot where the first white settler built his house. The history of the\
        \ city, therefore, can but be a record of the peaceful conquest of a virgin\
        \ soil, only occasionally disturbed by little internal dissensions or financial\
        \ convulsions ; a record indeed, that is a blessing to the inhabitants of\
        \ such a place, but not of a character to excite the lively interest and sympathy\
        \ of an outside world.", 1]

        \ towards fountains of unpublished historical details about the Counties of\
        \ Ireland, preserved in the Royal Irish Academy of Dublin. Here I have obtained\
        \ a large amount of hitherto unpublished historical matter, preserved in manuscripts\
        \ written by the late Mr. John O'Donovan, of the Ulster Ordnance Survey Staff,\
        \ during his tour of Ireland, made in 1837. The great kindness of Mr. J. J.\
        \ M'Sweeny, the polite and learned librarian of the Royal Irish Academy, I\
        \ can never forget ; and, whilst anxious as far as I can to avoid flattery,\
        \ I am bound to say that Mr. M'Sweeny's unassuming polite ness and general\
        \ urbanity was very pleasing to me, who, diffident as to my chances of success\
        \ in this volume, was greatly encouraged and assisted by his experienced hints\
        \ to me. Having collected the original publication on this subject, which\
        \ appeared in the columns of a local journal, I submitted it to Mr. Justin\
        \ M'Carthy, M.P. (himself the author of so many fascinating novels of the\
        \ present day), and, in reply to the request for a criticism, Mr. M'Carthy\

        \ dear Sir, I return you your little book, which I have read with much interest\
        \ and pleasure. I think it would make a very useful little History of Long\
        \ ford, and would be found interesting to all Irishmen at home and abroad.\
        \ It would, of course, need some revision in order to make it suitable for\
        \ book-form ; for instance, the little passages here and there which refer\
        \ to previous articles would have to be omitted, so as to make it a continuous\
        \ and symmetrical narrative. I am sorry to have had to keep it so long, but\
        \ I was very busy. I hope that it may be a decided success in its book-form",

        \ and of the commerce of Greenock during the last half of the eighteenth century,\
        \ and the early years of the nineteenth. From the date of the first harbour\
        \ extension in 175 1, down till 1768, the commercial importance of Greenock\
        \ as a rising seaport had been rapidly developing. Improving the natural advantages\
        \ they possessed in their noble estuary, and extensive and safe anchorage\
        \ ground, available irrespective of wind or tide, the inhabitants had not\
        \ confined themselves to the herring fishery and coasting traffic, but had\
        \ been pushing their foreign trade with indomitable energy, and had acquired\
        \ a reputation for possessing enterprising merchants, skilful navigators,\
        \ and fast sailing ships. The old pictorial view of Greenock, elsewhere noticed,\
        \ depicted the number and size of the ships trading to the port. These, although\
        \ of comparatively small tonnage, were considered a great advance on the times\
        \ which had preceded them. Ten years before the date last mentioned, American\

        Anderson who died many years ago at an advanced age, and Margaret, wife of
        ths well-known and estimable Mr. Lome Campbell, factor to the Duke of Argyll.
        It is unnecessary to follow this branch of the genealogy further. Mr. Andrew
        Anderson (senior) was the intimate friend and correspondent of James Watt.
        In 1770 he feued the ground at the corner of Kilblain and Nicolson Streets,
        which was long the family homestead. It was one of the earliest feus in the
        New Town of Greenock. He is styled in the feu contract Captain Andrew Anderson,
        merchant. The feu is described as lying on the south side of the street laid
        off leading from Long Vennel head of Greenock, towards Gurrock. Some of the
        rooms were fitted up in the old wainscot style still seen in the older parts
        of the town. In 1789 he purchased a lair in the Innerkip Street Burying-Ground,
        and we hope we commit no breach of propriety in quoting'' the inscription,
        which bears that it was purchased " for a depository of the bodys of himself
        and family in the firm belief that Jesus died and rose again, and that them
        which sleep in Jesus the Lord shall bring with him." Mr. Andrew Anderson and
        his brother James died in the same year, the former aged S6, and the latter
        84. In the same burying-ground are the remains of Mrs. Andrew Anderson, and
        of Dr. William, Miss Janet, and James Andrew Anderson. Messrs James and Andrew
        Anderson were partners with Mr. Dunlop, of Keppoch, and Mr. William Fullarton,
        as merchants, under the firm of Andersons, Fullarton & Dunlop, their place
        of business being first in Cathcart Street, and afterwards at the corner of
        Watson''s Lane where it joins Hamilton Street in the rear of the Buck Head
        Hall. Mr. James Anderson, of whom less is known than of his brother Andrew,
        was one of the magistrates of Greenock in 1791-92, having in the first year
        Mr. James Hunter for his colleague, and in the second Mr. Francis Garden.
        Mr. Fullarton was one of the four sons of the Reverend John Fullarton, minister
        of Dairy, and was brother of worthy Dr. Gavin Fullarton, surgeon in Greenock.*
        Of Alexander Anderson, the second son of the minister of Dumbarton, we read
        only that he was Librarian of Glasgow College, and afterwards minister of
        Sorbie> where he died shortly after his settlement. The third son, John (the
        Bailie), was a merchant in Greenock, engaged in extensive business in addition
        to the official status he held. He was one of the early partners of the Brewery
        and Distillery Companies, and in 1 755, about four years after his death,
        his interest was transferred by his daughters to new partners. In this transaction
        they acted with concurrence of their curators (their uncle, the Professor,
        Bailie Rae and Bailie Watt, being three of them), proving that at their father''s
        death they were all in minority. Their mother, Helen Hill, had died nearly
        three years before their father. The names of the daughters were Helen, wife
        of Hugh Moody, merchant ; Cathcart, wife of Dr. David Colquhoun, Agnes, second
        wife of the Reverend Dr. John Adam, minister of the New or Mid Parish of Greenock
        ; and Dick or Dickie Anderson, who died un married. Their names are found
        in connexion with various properties in different parts of the town. We merely
        note that the Hill''s property descended to them, and that they afterwards
        (in 1766) acquired the property to the south of it, fronting * See App. L.',

        \ and president, an office to which he was re-elected in ten successive years.\
        \ \" In the year 1813 a few gentlemen in Greenock instituted a club for the\
        \ purpose of meeting together once a fortnight during the winter months, to\
        \ spend an hour or two in general conversation. These meetings for the first\
        \ two years took place in the Masons' Arms Tavern. The club assumed no particular\
        \ designation, and its sittings were conducted upon the simple model of domestic\
        \ life. A president was chosen, who took the chair, and was treated with the\
        \ same gentlemanly defer ence and good-breeding which a landlord might expect\
        \ from the guests invited by him to partake of the hospitality of his house\
        \ and table. The original members of the club were Dr. Kirk, Messrs, George\
        \ Blair [wine merchant] Duncan Smith [hat manufacturer] and George Williamson\
        \ [writer]. In consequence of some objection taken to the accommodation afforded\
        \ to the Club at the Masons' Arms, they removed to the Tavern at the foot\
        \ of William Street, then known as \" The Greenock Tavern,\" kept by Mrs Cunningham,\
        \ subsequently by Mrs. Lyle, and at the period when this sketch is written\
        \ (October, 1824), by Mrs Fairlie. After the removal of the Club to the Greenock\
        \ Tavern, other members were introduced at different periods. These were Rev.\
        \ John Dunn [afterwards librarian], James Henderson [merchant], Colin Buchanan\
        \ [writing master], John Mennons [proprietor of the Greenock Advertiser],\
        \ Allan Swan [writer], William Kerr [writer], James Mollison, M.D., William\

        \ Crawford [writer], James L. Brown [Rector of the grammar school], James\
        \ Watt [brewer], Rev. Dr. Gilchrist [East Parish Church]. In 1820, Mr. Buchanan\
        \ suggested to the Club the propriety of stirring up the community of Greenock\
        \ to testify by some act their admiration of the splendid character of James\
        \ Watt of Birmingham, the Improver of the Steam Engine, whom they had the\
        \ honour of claiming as a townsman, and who had died in 1 Si 9. It was thought\
        \ that this might be best done by a Public Dinner, but as the town was then\
        \ divided by a feud originating in a dispute betwixt the pattizans of the\
        \ old and new Coffee Rooms of Greenock, and in a recent election of Magistrates,\
        \ it was feared that a meeting in which it was intended to in clude citizens\
        \ of all parties could not without considerable difficulty be brought about.\
        \ The difficulty was got over. It took place in the Tontine Hotel on Friday,\
        \ 19th January 1 82 1, the anniversary of Mr. Watt's birth. Mr. Denniston,\
        \ Chief Magistrate, presided, Mr. Baine, junior Magistrate, and Mr. Robert\
        \ Steuart, Baron Bailie, being croupiers. For many years, almost without any\
        \ intermission, the Club dined together on each anniver sary. The Club exists\
        \ now only on paper. \" An account of the dinner appeared in the 'Greenock\
        \ Advertiser' of 23rd January, 1821, and afterwards in the 'London Monthly\

        was a young man, who, I feared, might not have experience enough to act alone,
        and I made sure that on hearing of my mishap, he Avould hasten to Paris, and
        spend both time and money, perhaps in pure waste, to get me free. However,
        every road leads to Rome, and all my anxious musings brought me to the conclusion
        that I had reached one of those crises in life when a man must arm himself
        with courage. I wrote to the Embassy on the day when I had seen the Governor
        ; and the same afternoon I received an English book from the librarian. This
        work (Scott''s " Fair Maid of Perth ") was a great boon. Books one reads on
        board ship, in bed when recovering from illness, or in prison, acquire a double
        savour ; and one''s reading under such conditions is very different from the
        hasty, cursory perusal which we bestow on books in busy freedom. After the
        above-named novel I read " Kenilworth," " Tales of a Grandfather," Cooper''s
        "Two Admirals," Bulwer''s "Rienzi" and " Pelham," Harrison Ainsworth''s "
        Spendthrift," and Charlotte Bronte''s "Jane Eyre." I had read them all before,
        but now discovered in many of them beauties never sus- pected. " Jane Eyre
        " especially gave me exquisite pleasure ; I thought it the sweetest, most
        truthfully-drawn work of fiction in our language, and its effect lingered
        upon me in the form of calm thoughts, resignation, and hope, like a clear
        twilight after a bright day, for a full week after I had finished it. The

        \ vicarage, of Avhich the same authority declares Bishop Booth to have been\
        \ the founder in a preceding reign. King James, it is said, when on a visit\
        \ to the Earl of Derby at Knowsley, 6 was riding alone in a country lane,\
        \ when he saw something lying in one of the ruts, which, by its glittering\
        \ iu the sun, attracted his attention. His curiosity being excited, the king\
        \ alighted from his horse, aud finding it to be a silver horseshoe, he put\
        \ it into his pocket, not doubting that it belonged to the earl, or some of\
        \ the nobles in his company. Accordingly, after dinner his majesty produced\
        \ the horseshoe, and inquired who was its owner, when, to his great astonishment,\
        \ it was claimed by the rector of Prescot. \"Well,\" said the king, \"if the\

        \ to the inhabitants. The subscription was opened in May, 1815, and the first\
        \ issue of gas was made from the old works, in Avenham Lane in the February\
        \ following, at the price of 15s. per 1,000 feet. The works were first undertaken\
        \ with a capital of about \xA32,500, which was afterwards augmented to \xA3\
        12,000, and has since been increased to upwards of \xA3180,000. The offices\
        \ of the Gas Company in Fishergate were erected in 1877. The history of the\
        \ Public Press of Preston is contained in a narrow compass. As early as 1744\
        \ there was a newspaper published in Preston, The Preston Journal, 4pp., each\
        \ 14 inches by 10 inches,1 printed by W. Smith in Church, Street. In the year\
        \ of the rebellion of 1745, appeared The True British Gourant, published by\
        \ Robert Moon, and afterwards by James Stanley and John Moon ; but from lack\
        \ of patronage this journal was, at a subsequent period, discontinued. At\
        \ the breaking out of the revolutionary wars between France and England, when\
        \ the thirst for news was ardent in the extreme, the late Mr. Thomas Walker\
        \ established a newspaper, entitled The Preston Review, the first number of\
        \ which was published June 1, 1791. After languishing through a year with\
        \ indifferent success, this journal ceased. The next effort to supply the\
        \ inhabitants with a medium of intelligence and of commercial and professional\
        \ annunciation was made, with better success, by Mr. Thomas Croft, who issued\
        \ the first number of his publication on the 7th of February, 1807, under\
        \ the title of The Preston Journal; this was afterwards continued on the Saturday,\
        \ by Mr. Wilcockson, under the altered title of The Preston Chronicle, which\
        \ it took on the 5th of September, 1812, and subsequently by him in partnership\
        \ with Mr. Lawrence Dobson, and by Messrs. William and James Dobson. This\
        \ has passed out of Messrs. Dobson's hands, and is now published by Mr. A.\
        \ Hewitson. The Preston Sentinel was published by Mr. L. Clarke, from Saturday,\
        \ the 7th of April, 1821, to Saturday, the 30th of March, 1822, when it was\
        \ discontinued ; but, on the 1st of January, 1825, another newspaper was issued\
        \ from the same office, called The Preston Pilot, which is also published\
        \ on the Saturday In 1837 The Preston Observer was started by a joint-stock\
        \ company, but after several times changing hands it ceased in 1840, when\
        \ The Preston Advertiser commenced a very brief career. In 1844 'The Preston\
        \ Guardian was commenced by Messrs. Livesey and Son, and this, now published\
        \ by Mr. George Toulmin, 'The Preston Herald (started in 1855), The Chronicle,\
        \ The Pilot, and The Advertiser, form the public press of tho town. No works\
        \ of any great note have been printed in this town, though several men of\
        \ literary eminence have received their education here.2 The town of Preston\
        \ is indebted for Shepherd's Library to an alderman of this borough, Richard\
        \ Shepherd, a physician of eminence, who died on the 4th of December, 1761,\
        \ bequeathing, by will dated June 18, 1759, \" all and every of his books,\
        \ of what nature or kind soever, to his executors, in trust, for the mayor\
        \ and aldermen of the borough, or corporation of Preston ; \" and confiding\
        \ to the said mayor and aldermen the power to give to any person they should\
        \ direct the privilege to read or inspect such books. The testator further\
        \ bequeathed \xA3200, to be placed out at interest, and to be applied by the\
        \ mayor and aldermen to the purpose of paying the librarian's salary ; and\
        \ the interest of the residue, being \xA31,000, arising out of his personal\
        \ estates, he directed to be applied by them in purchasing books for enlarging\
        \ and increasing the library. After being for some time deposited in a room\
        \ in Shepherd Street, a room for them was erected adjoining the Grammar School\
        \ in that street, and was open at stated hours for the admission of persons\
        \ by ticket from the mayor or any of the aldermen. From 1851 to 1868 the library\
        \ was housed in the Institution for the Diffusion of Knowledge. In the latter\
        \ year the corporation purchased a build ing in Cross Street, erected for\
        \ the Literary and Philosophical Institution, which, after an existence of\
        \ twenty-seven years, was then closed. Important as was Dr. Shepherd's munificent\
        \ donation, it must be obvious that even if it was open without restriction,\
        \ it would by no means be equal to the literary requirements of a town like\
        \ Preston. Under the influence of this persuasion a public library was established\
        \ in 1825, in Fishergate, named the \" Palatine Library.\" This was after-\
        \ wards merged in the above-named Literary and Philosophical Institution.\
        \ The principal literary society of the town now is the Institution for the\
        \ Diffusion of Knowledge, which resembles in its principal features a mechanics'\
        \ institute. This excellent establishment consists of a library with 7,000\
        \ volumes, a museum of natural history and miscellaneous rarities, and a large\
        \ collection of insects formed by Mr. William Helme, a weaver, and a reading\

        \ EDMUND LAW, D.D., Lord Bishop of Carlisle, the son of the Reverend Mr. Law,\
        \ minister of a small chapel in the neighbour hood of Cartmel, descended from\
        \ an ancient family long resident at Abkham, in Westmoreland. He was born\
        \ in the year 1703, and was educated for some time at Cartmel School, and\
        \ afterwards at the Free Grammar School of Kendal. and from thence procted'd\
        \ to St. John's College, Cambridge. In 1723 he took the degree of bachelor\
        \ of arts, and was soon after elected fellow of Christ's College, and in 1727\
        \ proceeded master. During his residence here Mr. Law became known to the\
        \ public by a. translation of Arch bishop King's \" Essay on the Origin of\
        \ Evil,\" with copious notes. He also, while at Cambridge, undertook and went\
        \ through a very laborious part in preparing for the press an edition of Stephens's\
        \ \" Thesaurus.\" His acquaintance during his first residence at the University\
        \ was principally with Dr. Waterland, the learned master of Magdalen College,\
        \ Dr. Jortin, a name known to every reader, and Dr. Taylor, the editor of\
        \ \"Demosthenes.\" In 1737 he was presented by the University to the living\
        \ of Graystoke, in the county of Cumberland, a rectory of about \xA3300 per\
        \ annum. The advowson of this benefice belonged to the Howards of Graystoke,\
        \ but devolved to the University for this turn by virtue of an Act of Parliament,\
        \ which transfers to these two bodies the nomination to such benefices as\
        \ appertain, at the time of the vacancy, to the patronage of a Roman Catholic.\
        \ The right, however, of the University was contested, and it was not till\
        \ after a lawsuit of two years' continuance thai Mr. Law was settled in his\
        \ living. In 1743 he was promoted to the archdeaconry of Carlisle, and in\
        \ 1746 went from Graystoke to reside at Salkeld, a pleasant village on the\
        \ banks of the river Eden, the rectory of which is annexed to the archdeaconry.\
        \ Mr. Law was not one of those who lose and forget themselves in the country.\
        \ During his residence at Salkeld he published \" Considerations on the Theory\
        \ of Religion,\" to which were subjoined \" Reflections on the Life aud Character\
        \ of Christ ; and an Appendix concerning the use of the words Soul and Spirit\
        \ in Holy Scripture, and the state of the Dead there described.\" In 1749\
        \ he took his degree of doctor of divinity, but with considerable opposition,\
        \ on account of the doctrines expressed in his thesis on \" The Sleep of the\
        \ Soul,\" from Archbishops Herring and Potter, and several of the heads of\
        \ houses. In 1754 he was elected master of St. Peter's College, Cambridge,\
        \ and resigned his archdeaconry immediately afterwards. About the year 1760\
        \ he was appointed head librarian of the University. Some time after this\
        \ he was also appointed Professor of Casuistry. In the year 1762 he suffered\
        \ an irreparable loss by the death of his wife, Mary, daughter of John Christian,\
        \ of Unerigg, in the county of Cumberland, Esq., a loss rendered more afflicting\
        \ by the situation of his family of eleven children, many of them very young.\
        \ In the course of the next few years he received several preferments, which\
        \ were rather honourable expressions of regard from his friends than of much\
        \ advantage to his fortune. By Dr. Cornwallis, then Bishop of Lichfield, afterwards\
        \ Archbishop of Canterbury, who had been his pupil at Christ's College, he\
        \ was appointed to the archdeaconry of Staffordshire, and to a prebend in\
        \ the church of Lichfield. By his old acquaintance, Dr. Green, Bisbop of Lincoln,\
        \ he was also made a prebendary of that church. But in the year 1767, by the\
        \ intervention of the Duke of Newcastle, to whose interest in the memorable\
        \ contest for the high-stewardship of the University, he had adhered in opposition\
        \ to some temptations, he obtained a stall in Durham Cathedral. The year after\
        \ this, the Duke of Grafton, who had a short time before been elected chancellor\
        \ of the University, recommended him for the bishopric of Carlisle, not only\
        \ without his solicitation or that of his friends, but without his know'elge.\
        \ In 1777 Dr., now Bishop, Law gave to the public a handsome edition, in three\

        \ of American bibliographers. The catalogue, prepared under his direc tion,\
        \ was completed in the winter of 1882, after twenty-five years of labor. It\
        \ fills five large volumes, with an aggregate of over 3,400 pages. It catalogues\
        \ the con tents of the library on Jan. 1, 1872, then consisting of 92,000\
        \ volumes and 36,000 pamphlets, under a quarter of a million of separate entries,\
        \ under the names of authors, titles, and some 6,000 subjects. These entries\

        \ the most important and practical of the institutions of Boston. In 1880\
        \ numbering over 460,000 volumes, and 115,000 unbound pamphlets, its growth\
        \ has been remarkably rapid. Be tween the years 1841 and 1851, various attempts\
        \ at establishing a free public li brary in Boston were made. Sums of money\
        \ were offered conditionally, and an attempt was at one time made to avail\
        \ of the existing library of the Boston Athe n\xE6um. After a while, a few\
        \ books were given for a free library ; others had been acquired by exchange\
        \ with the city of Paris through Alexander Vattemaire ; and Edward Everett\
        \ gave his large collection of United States public documents for this purpose.\
        \ In one way or another, iu these few years, 2,000 volumes were col lected\
        \ ; and in 1852 the movement had so far developed that a librarian was ap\
        \ pointed, and a real interest began to be manifested in the undertaking.\
        \ During this year, 1852, the board of trustees was organized, under an act\
        \ of incorporation which had been obtained four years be fore. Fortunate it\
        \ was that this first board was composed of men of broad and large views and\
        \ of practical good sense. Edward Everett was the first president of the board;\
        \ and to him, and to the late George Ticknor, his successor, the city is mainly\
        \ indebted for the plan adopted, and the successful organization of the en\
        \ terprise. The project laid down in the first report of the trustees attracted\
        \ the attention of Joshua Bates, of the great banking house of Baring Brothers\
        \ of London, himself Boston born ; and he was moved to give towards it $50,000.\

        in 1851, and incorporated under its present title in 1852. Originally an organization
        of young men to engage in various fields of benevolent and philanthropic work,
        it has grown to be a leading institution of the city, of broad influence and
        great usefulness. The chief aim of its officers is to make its rooms, to as
        great an ex tent as possible, a home for young men ; and to offer every possible
        attraction in the shape of books, papers, games, pleas ant companions, classes,
        dramatic and musical entertainments, and other means of recreation as well
        as instruction. Its officers also engage in much outside work, in which they
        are assisted by members and by committees of ladies who interest themselves
        in such movements. Among these special objects are the '' '' Rides for In
        valids," the "''Christmas and New Year''s Festivals for Needy Children,''1
        the " Bu reau of Reference for Women, '' '' the " Country Week for Poor Children,"
        and the " Fruit Depot." Its present build ing, which it owns free of indebtedness,
        is an attractive structure near Tremont Street, overlooking the Common, and
        open to air and light on every side. At the head of the first flight of stairs
        from the main entrance on Boylston Street is the reception-room. The members
        and all other persons visiting the Union enter here, and from it pass to the
        other por tions of the building occupied by the so ciety. Here is stationed
        the ciirator and librarian. The room is supplied with croquet and bagatelle
        boards, tables for checkers and dominoes, an aquarium, and a case containing

    - ['VI PREFACE. afforded a great variety of details by which I have endeavoured
        to give colour and interest to the narrative. Besides these, and many other
        printed works, I have also had the advantage of perusing many manuscript histories,
        among which may be particularly mentioned the works of Pontus Payen, of Renom
        de France, and of Pasquier de la Barre ; while the vast collection of unpublished
        documents in the Royal Archives of the Hague, of Brussels, and of Dresden,
        has fur nished me with much new matter of great importance. I venture to hope
        that many years of labour, a portion of them in the archives of those countries
        whose history forms the object of my study, will not have been entirely in
        vain ; and that the lovers of human pro gress, the believers in the capacity
        of nations for self-government and self-improvement, and the admirers of disinterested
        human genius and virtue, may find encouragement for their views in the detailed
        history of an heroic people in its most eventful period, and in the life and
        death of the great man whose name and fame are identical with those of his
        country. No apology is offered for this somewhat personal statement. When
        an unknown writer asks the attention of the public upon an important theme,
        he is not only authorised, but required, to show that by industry and earnestness
        he has entitled himself to a hear ing. The author, too, keenly feels that
        he has no further claims than these, and he therefore most diffidently asks
        for his work the indul gence of his readers. I would take this opportunity
        of expressing my gratitude to Dr. Klemm, Hofrath and Chief Librarian at Dresden,
        and to Mr. Von Weber, Ministerial-rath and Head of the Royal Archives of Saxony
        for the courtesy and kindness extended to me so uniformly during the course
        of my researches in that city. I would also speak a word of sincere thanks
        to Mr. Campbell, Assistant-Librarian at the Hague, for his numerous acts of
        friendship during the absence of his chief, M. Holtrop. To that most distinguished
        critic and historian, M. Bak huyzen van den Brinck, Chief Archivist of the
        Netherlands, I am under deep obligations for advice, instruction, and constant
        kindness during my residence at the Hague ; and I would also signify my sense
        of the courtesy of Mr. Charter- Master de Schwane, and of the accuracy with
        which copies of MSS. in the archives were prepared for me by his care. Finally,
        I would allude in the strongest language of gratitude and respect to M. Gachard,
        Archivist-General of Belgium, for his unweared courtesy and manifold acts
        of kindness to me during my studies in the Royal Archives of Brussels.', 1]

        \ more cheerful than it did upon Harry's first night in it. There were a few\
        \ ornaments upon the chimney-piece, in the form of shells and china figures,\
        \ that Harry had purchased at a fair at Ashton. There were now to be seen\
        \ a few pictures upon the walls that were before so bare. Certainly they were\
        \ not sporting pictures, nor suggestive of \" love's young dream.\" One picture\
        \ represented a jolly looking young woman who was very stout, and had the\
        \ arms of a woman who had to wash and mangle for a regi ment of soldiers.\
        \ This young woman was trying to roll something, that looked like a boat,\
        \ up a green hill decorated with daisies and buttercups. On drawing near to\
        \ this picture, sufficiently to enable you to read small type, you were informed\
        \ that the young woman in the boat was Grace Darling. On reading this, you\
        \ instantly perceived that the green hill was the sea, and the daisies growing\
        \ upon the top of it were the angry, storm-tossed billows. There were one\
        \ or two more pictures he had bought later on, that showed an improvement\
        \ in artistic taste ; one representing an old Dutch windmill with its surroundings,\
        \ while another was a landscape on a summer eve, with cattle grazing. Joseph\
        \ Harwood's hair is now quite white and cut very closely, the furrows have\
        \ depeened upon his brow, and the solemnity of his face has increased, though\
        \ somewhat softened. He still preaches at home and in his \" church,\" and\
        \ though he preaches the same doctrine, he is not so energetic in his style,\
        \ except upon odd occasions, when he manifests the same old fire, when he\
        \ reiterates the same old passages and quotations, from Jonathan Edward's\
        \ sermon on hell. Harry Hilton has taken a prominent place in the church \u2014\
        \ that is, prominent for his age. He is a Sunday-school teacher, a Sunday-school\

        a very worshipful personage, and was waited on with every mark of respect
        and reverence. He had horses and servants for his use, and when he showed
        himself in public his train was nearly as imposing as that of the abbot, to
        whom he was held to be not greatly inferior in wisdom and holiness. He had
        the power of imprisoning refractory canons, though not of exjielling them
        from the community. There was a prior for every ten canons. The functionary
        next in rank was the precentor or chanter. This office could be filled only
        by a monk who had been educated in the monastery from a child. He presided
        over the psalmody, an office of great importance, seeing monastic worship
        consisted largely of choral services. The precentor was charged with the care
        of other things besides the chants. He was keeper of the sacred robes ; he
        distributed to each the dress in which he was to appear at the public festivals,
        and when the procession marched out he took his place at the head of it. He
        was, moreover, custodier of the archives, in other words chief librarian,
        an office not very onerous in those days. Next came the cellarer. He was chief
        of the commissariat of the abbey or priory. He was to see to the proper victualling
        of the establishment, and mete out daily provision for the inmates. He must
        take care that there was no scarcity in the abbey barn, and no stint or pinch
        at the refectory table. He must permit no one to sit down to dinner till first
        the abbot and prior have taken their seats, and when the repast has ended,
        he must collect the spoons and other vessels and carry them to the kitchen,
        where they were to remain under his charge. He was to do special honour to
        the abbot''s spoon, by carrying it in his right hand and the spoons of the
        canons in his left.', 1]

        \ At that period books were very scarce and dear. There were no shilling volumes\

        \ monthly journals, no penny newspapers, nor the endless literary attractions\
        \ that now exist ou all sides amongst us. Like many important undertakings,\
        \ it had its origin in a very humble way. Richard Gossman, William Carnegie,\
        \ and Charles Ander son, weavers in Moodie Street, agreed to make a common\
        \ good of the books each possessed ; but finding their stock too small, they\
        \ applied to some others, and a committee was afterwards constituted, composed\

        \ up ships for the first voyage, which, as was supposed, did not take place\
        \ till 1498. The original grant of this license, of which Hakluyt publishes\

        \ Privy Gallery at Westminster, and in many other ancient merchants' houses.\"\
        \ This language is a little equivocal, and some have supposed that Hakluyt\

        \ who was born in 1795, and died in 1S47. It is a work of great value for\
        \ its authorities, and displays much crit ical talent ; and though composed\
        \ with little system and with a strong bias in favor of Sebas tian Cabot,\

        with the fact that it is the only work of the kind extant having reference
        to the Fylde, in a measure decided for us the course we are now taking in
        re-publishing it. In doing so, it is but justice to say that the author, the
        late Rev. Wm. Thornber, A.B., formerly Incumbent of Blackpool, was as much
        respected for himself, as admired for his works. This is our small tribute
        to his memory. At the suggestion of Mr. C. S. Sutton, Librarian at the Free
        Library, Manchester, we give to our subscri bers a short biographical notice
        of the author, thereby, we hope, rendering the book a still more valuable
        acqui sition. To Mr. T. Lawrenson, of Poulton-le-Fylde, a personal friend
        of the late Mr. Thornber, we are indebted for the subject-matter, and beg
        to tender him our sincere thanks. To Dr. Walker, of Kirkham, and T. J. Porter,
        Esq., of Fleetwood, we here express our gratitude for kindnesses and assistance.

        \ establishment of lending libraries may be seen in the Decrcta pro Online\

        \ from his able biographer : ' More practical was Lanfranc's own regulation\
        \ with respect to a lending library. At the beginning of Lent the librarian\
        \ was directed to collect the books and spread them upon a carpet, except\
        \ those which were given out during the preceding year. He then called over\
        \ the names of the brethren, and each, as his name was pronounced, restored\
        \ the book which he had received. If anyone was conscious of not having read\
        \ the book, he was to prostrate himself before the abbot, declare his fault,\
        \ and ask for pardon. Then the librarian assigned to each brother another\
        \ book, and after their distribution he handed over to the chapter a list\
        \ of the books lent and of the persons to whom they had been allotted.' Such\
        \ is the pleasant account ; on which, however, it is to be remarked that it\
        \ was the monks who in those days were the readers, whereas now every little\
        \ child can obtain the New Testament and the Prayer Book, each beautifully\
        \ printed, at twopence apiece. We do not, I am afraid, half know either our\
        \ advan tages and opportunities or our responsibilities. It would take up,\
        \ however, too much space if I were to recount all that was said to me by\

        \ lack of thorough grasp of theory, or a neglect of the history of the subject.\
        \ There are the various phases of socialism, attacks on the ownership of land\
        \ ; opposition to classic study ; the partisanship of pure science to the\
        \ neglect of the humanities ; the advocacy of an exclusive \"greenback \"\
        \ currency ; or the unlimited coinage of silver on a basis of value different\
        \ from that of the market of the world. Sincerity is not a proof of truth,\
        \ but it makes converts among un educated people with active intellects. The\
        \ university-extension movement meets these conditions and does good. There\
        \ has been an adoption of this movement in this country by many higher institutions,\
        \ and chiefly by the University of Pennsylvania. The public library has become\
        \ one of the chief educational forces in the community. As long ago as 1876\
        \ General Eaton, then Commissioner of Education, collected the statistics\
        \ of 3,647 public libraries, and on revising the list ten years later extended\
        \ it to 5,328 libraries. The aggregate number of volumes in these 5,328 libraries\
        \ was 20,622,078 volumes. Massachusetts took the lead, with 569 libraries,\
        \ containing 3,560,085 volumes. Next came New York, with 2,168,508 volumes\
        \ in 780 libraries. It is not, however, the increase of libraries that is\
        \ so remarkable ; it is the increase of a class of professional librarians\
        \ who are fruitful in new methods of making their collections useful to the\
        \ people at large. A new report on libraries, now in press, returns for 1891\
        \ 3,804 public libraries of i.coo volumes and upward, with an aggregate of\
        \ 31,176,354 volumes, the same being an increase of 817 libraries (over 1,000\
        \ volumes each) and 12,1 1 1,280 volumes since 1885. This is 34 books to each\
        \ 100 of the population. In 1891 three States report over 1,000,000 volumes\
        \ in public libraries of 1,000 volumes and upward \u2014 namely, Massachusetts,\
        \ 3,353,229 in 427 public libra ries ; New York, 2,900,639 in 397 libraries\
        \ ; Pennsylvania, 1,770,600 in 2S6 libraries. Ohio follows next, with 989,485\
        \ volumes in 157 libraries. The school teaches how to read, the library furnishes\
        \ what to read, and turns life into a continuous university. The reader who\
        \ visits the library to study a special topic is provided with indexes showing\
        \ what books and what articles in periodicals have treated of it. American\

        \ to those who will hear, something of all learning, and where, by contact\
        \ with their teachers, the youth acquires a sense of the fullness of knowl\
        \ edge. In this country7, where the very foundation of our life is in the\
        \ theory of like opportunity for all men, it seems to be a mis take of a pernicious\
        \ sort to follow the aristocratic traditions of the Old World, by separating\
        \ the education designed for those engaged in the higher technical pursuits\
        \ from that contrived for the man who is to follow the ancient professions.\
        \ It is clear that education and the culture which comes from it are the common\
        \ field of democracy. In it our people are to find the one chance to develop\
        \ the motives of unity which may make head against the caste-giving influences\
        \ which inevitably arise in every- old society7. This unification can not\
        \ be sufficiently effected in our elementary education. Already we perceive\
        \ a great disposition on the part of our wealthier classes to train their\
        \ children in private schools and academies which are not much resorted to\
        \ by7 the body of our people. If now our higher education is to be so arranged\
        \ that the men of different pursuits do not meet on a common ground, we shall\
        \ cast away one of the best opportunities of doing an edu cational work such\
        \ as our country needs. In one of the resources of higher education our people\
        \ have made great progress. They have developed public libraries, or those\
        \ connected with institutions of learning, in great numbers, and have managed\
        \ them with admirable system. It is true that we have in America no collections\
        \ of books which are as exten sive as half a dozen of the largest collections\
        \ in Europe ; those assemblages, however, are the results of centuries of\
        \ expenditure and opportunity- ; most of them have had the support of national\
        \ revenues. In America, or at least within the United States, the ideal of\
        \ the librarians has been to bring together the books which would best serve\
        \ for the use of the class of people which has access to them, and to organize\
        \ the methods of cataloguing so that the stores might be most readily accessible.\
        \ In these tasks they have been so successful that we already have more useful\
        \ and more numerous libraries than any country- in Europe. The results of\
        \ the formal education of any country are well indicated by the success of\
        \ the men engaged in professional life. Judged by this test, our American\

        \ grades must be regarded as very successful. The learned professions, measured\

        \ recounting his exploits with his comrades, he told of their capture and\
        \ the execution of three of his gang, whilst he escaped hanging, and was transported,\
        \ because he turned King's evidence. \" Traitor,\" cried the whole gang, and\
        \ the captain said \" since he had escaped his just deserts at home, and they\

        \ of the Order of St. Francis, viz., Michael O'Clery, Cugory O'Clery, Conary\

        \ of the same name. The President, Michael O'Clery, author of many learned\

        \ near Ballyshannon (see pages 23, 24). He was descended from a family of\

        \ space at this little visited one. Does anybody weary for a \"lodge in some\
        \ vast wilderness?\" That very undesirable residence is now a little difficult\
        \ to be had. The world is fast filling up, and railways, steamboats, and tour\
        \ contractors are agencies most inimical to hermits of all degrees. Still\
        \ there is a chance, and to a man weary of his species I can entirely recommend\
        \ Lord Howe Island. Out of the multiplicity of isles \"amid the melancholy\
        \ main,\" it is puzzling on even a good atlas to pick the one dedicated to\
        \ the hero of \"the glorious 1st of June.-' Ships sail in and out of Sydney\
        \ Harbour, yet few ever land at this tiny islet, discovered as far back as\
        \ 1788 by Lieutenant Henry Ball, while on a voyage to Norfolk Island from\
        \ Port Jackson, in New South Wales. No land lies nearer it than Port Macquarie,\
        \ 300 miles west, and Norfolk Island is nearly double that distance from this\
        \ lonely spot. Only about seven miles long and two or three in breadth at\
        \ its greatest width, a vessel might be almost in the vicinity of it without\
        \ being aware of its situation, were it not for the high oceanic peak of Ball's\
        \ Pyramid (p. 8*1), which can be seen twelve or thirteen miles distant. But\
        \ its own hills are even higher, Mount Gower being 2,800 and Mount Lidgbird\
        \ some 100 feet lower. The soil is volcanic, but rich, and covered with a\
        \ bounteous vegetation of palms, screw pines, and wild figs, and a dense undergrowth\
        \ of ferns, grasses, and the fairy-like orchids that twine from trunk to trunk.\
        \ Wild pigs are the only large bush animals, but goats are nearlv as abundant\
        \ as they were on that other island of romance whilom reputed to be the home\
        \ of Kobinson Crusoe, of York, mariner. Fruit trees and culinary vegetables\
        \ grow abundantly, and among the first features which strike the weather beaten\
        \ seaman who comes on this summer isle of Eden are the orange groves, and\
        \ the patches of water-melons, pomegranates, onions, potatoes, Indian corn,\
        \ pumpkins, and tobacco \u2014 all of which have been introduced. Vines grow\
        \ well, and the banana ripens its great golden bunches of delicious fruit.\
        \ Dogs yelp round the houses, oxen plough the patches of cultivated land,\
        \ horses there are a few, while the cat, which follows woman all over the\
        \ world, is on Lord Howe Island kept in full occupation by the swarms of mice\
        \ whicli have taken up their quarters in this secluded siding of the globe.\
        \ There are swarms of ducks, pigeons, paroquets, magpies, doves, and mutton\
        \ birds, valuable for their oil, though not particularly toothsome as food,\
        \ while off the reefs fish of many kinds can be caught in abundance. No reptile,\
        \ not even a lizard, exists on the island ; and its woods are frequented by\
        \ no animals more terrible than pigs and errant cats, who dine sumptuously\
        \ on parrots and turtle-doves every day of their vagabond lives. Even in that\
        \ prosaic Admiralty paper from which we take these particulars the land seems\
        \ a paradise, ancl none the less paradisaical because it is a small one. Lord\
        \ Howe Island we find on the maps, but it does not seem that even the ubiquitous\
        \ tourist has managed to reach this far-away land. In vain we search the British\
        \ Museum for its literature, and even the librarian of the Royal Geographical\
        \ Society shakes his learned head when his clientele asks for the latest or\
        \ any other book on this patch in the Australian seas. Few ships \u2014 and\
        \ every year fewer than ever \u2014 touch at it. Victoria takes no cognisance\
        \ of it, and even New South Wales has not had its earth-hunger whetted by\

        \ great love for delineation of character. He has considerable poAA'er of\

        \ in sympathy with Normans and English alike, Avhile his Avork is made bright\
        \ by humour and sharply-pointed remarks. His \" Gesta Regum Anglorum \" in\

        \ as Avell as his \" Historia Novella \" (to 1142), commenced in 1140 as a\
        \ sequel to the \" Gesta Regum,\" are little more than rough drafts, intended,\

        1208), Avho emulated the methods of Malmesbury, Avrote an \" Historia Rerum\

        \ obscure alchemist of the middle ages, whose life was wholly spent in searching\
        \ after the philosopher's stone. As the point I wished to elucidate was rather\
        \ impor tant, I went back to find the \" Giraldus.\" I hunted for a long time,\
        \ but was unable to discover anything of the book I wanted. In despair I consulted\
        \ the librarian, and he told me that he had seen a copy of the \" Giral dus\"\
        \ in two volumes about a year ago, but had lost sight of it since. He also\
        \ added that it was but little known, and that until myself no one had inquired\
        \ for it, with the exception of a young Englishman, who had left Heidelberg\
        \ about eight or nine months back. Under these circumstances nothing could\
        \ be done, as the book was evidently not in the library ; so, in despair,\
        \ I took myself home in no very amiable frame of mind at my failure. August\
        \ 27th. \u2014 I lectured to-day to my students, and during my discourse I\
        \ mentioned how unfortunate I had been with regard to the \" Giraldus.\" At\
        \ the end of my lecture Herr Buechler, one of my students, desired to speak\
        \ with me, and said he thought he could tell me where to find the \" Giraldus.\"\
        \ I asked him where, and he said he had lodged in the same house with a young\
        \ Englishman called Black, who had left Heidelberg about eight months ago.\

        \ Buechler also said that the young Englishman was a great admirer of the\
        \ works of Giraldus von Breen, and constantly studied them. He thought it\
        \ likely that Herr Black had taken them from the library to read at his lodgings,\
        \ and, as he had left a number of books behind him, the two volumes might\
        \ be amongst them. I immediately accompanied Herr Buechler to the late lodgings\
        \ of the young Englishman, and found there a great number of old books, principally\
        \ works on chemistry. Both Herr Buechler and myself hunted for a long time\
        \ without success, but at last the \" Giraldus \" was found hidden under a\
        \ pile of old manuscripts. Thanking Herr Buechler for his trouble, I took\
        \ the \" Giraldus \" home with me, and spent the night in taking notes from\

        or two hundred, as the case may be. They give notice to the Government of
        the amount voted, and the Government adds the same amount to the township
        money. It''s like the old game : you think of a number, and they double it.
        The Government has a depository of books, in Toronto, I think, and they sell
        them cheaper than the book-stores do. At any rate, the four hundred dollars''

        of the township. Five persons are picked out in the township as librarians,
        and they have to give security. My father is librarian for this section. The
        library is divided into five parts, and each librarian gets a share. Once
        a year I go to the next section and get all their books. They go to the next
        section, again, and get all the books at that place. A man comes to our house

        of books as Professor Renmark. The young fellows of her acquaintance read
        scarcely anything but the weekly papers ; they went with some care through
        the yellow almanac that vvas given away free, with the grocer''s name printed
        on the back. The marvellous cures the almanac recorded vvere of little interest,
        and were chiefly read by the older folk, but the young men revelled in the
        jokes to be found at the bottom of every page ; their only drawback being,
        that one could never tell the stories at a paring - bee or other social gathering,
        because everyone in the company had read them. A few of the young men came
        sheepishly round to get a book out of the library, but it was evident that
        their interest was not so much in the volume as in the librarian, and when
        that fact became apparent to the girl, she resented it. Margaret was thought
        to be cold and proud by the youth of the neigh bourhood, or "stuck-up," as
        they expressed it. To such a girl, a man like Renmark was a ''74', 1]

        the weather, live stock, and the prospects for the crops. The conversation
        at first did not include Margaret, but she listened to every word of it with
        interest. Her father and mother were anxious to hear about their boy ; and
        from that engrossing subject, the talk soon drifted to uni versity life, and
        the differences between city and country. At last the farmer, with a sigh,
        arose to go. There is little time for pleasant talk on a farm while daylight
        lasts. Margaret, remembering her duties as librarian, began to take in the
        books from the waggon to the front room. Renmark, slow in most things, was
        quick enough to offer his assistance on this occasion ; but he reddened some
        what as he did so, for he was unused to being a squire of dames. " I wish
        you would let me do the porterage," he said. " I would like to earn the right
        to look at these books sometimes, even though I may not have the privilege
        of borrowing, not being a taxable resident of the township." " The librarian,"
        answered Margaret, with a smile, " seems to be at liberty to use her own discretion
        in the matter of lending. No one has authority to look over her accounts,
        or to censure her if she lends recklessly. So, if you wish to borrow books,

        \ not as a physical, but as a moral resurrec- tionist, does him infinite credit),\
        \ I visited the base of the old tower, which had latterly been the sexton's\
        \ tool house, but formerly the western end of the church, being in olden time\
        \ entered on the north by a square porch, having a north window. On the destruction\

        \ leaving only space for a double door, which of course is always ke'pt locked\
        \ \u2014 and here I may add I was glad to note that both this one-time tool\
        \ house, and what has been the mortuary chamber on the floor above had been\
        \ emptied and partially swept \u2014 if not garnished. Our active and zealous\
        \ Tyssen librarian, Mr. Chambers, and Mr. Ivatts, of the London and Middlesex\
        \ Arch\xE6ological Society, were with us, and we were delighted to find a\

    - ["GLIMPSES OF ANCIENT HACKNEY. 108 As if to confirm our surmise, there, lying\
        \ on the ground, was a still more mysterious article\u2014 in shape like the\
        \ old-fashioned stretcher used by the police before the more convenient and\
        \ comfortable ambulance was invented. It was made of very stout materials,\
        \ but instead of the canvas, which formed the bottom of the stretcher, it\
        \ had open iron rails placed edgeways, lattice fashion, and the framework\
        \ was studded with sundry iron rails, bent and straight, with iron loops to\
        \ which stout cords could be fixed, so that the culprit so placed and secured\
        \ had not a chance of shifting his or her position. Here then, I conjectured,\
        \ must be the \" Coocking Stoole,\" as so described\u2014 or cucking stool\u2014\
        \ and I venture to infer that as the only stream in which the punishment could\
        \ be applied was the Hackney Brook close by, with scarcely two feet average\
        \ depth, this form of appliance was the only one which could ensure the victim\
        \ an adequate ducking; the stool or chair suspended from a lever, as depicted\
        \ in ancient engravings, requiring a depth of at least six feet of water to\
        \ render the punishment free from risk to life or limb. I hope our Tyssen\
        \ Librarian will soon become custodian of these relics of former punishment,\
        \ while at the same time I would as fervently desire that wife-beaters, children-starvers,\
        \ garrotters, and animal torturers should have an adequate dose of both or\
        \ either. We find ourselves once again in the main street, the highway from\
        \ London and country-wards. Confining our comments chiefly to the eastern\
        \ side of the road, but recently known as Church-street, but now throughout\
        \ its entire length called Mare-street, we find some few remains of the earlier\
        \ dwellings of Hackney ; many have been considerably altered, and within another\
        \ generation all will have disappeared. In the case of our village we find\
        \ that the inhabitants and their houses first clustered around the church,\
        \ not only as the one centre of divine worship, and its several sacred ordinances\
        \ affecting man's course from the cradle to the grave, but as we have reason\
        \ to believe in our former notice of the Old Tower, and its fortress-like\
        \ construction by the Knights Hospitallers, that, on the score of safety alone,\
        \ in times when every man did that which he deemed right in his own eyes,\
        \ they sought protection from possible enemies, and in every way felt safest\
        \ near the church. Hence, unlike what is often observed in rural districts,\

        \ on which Portland place now stands, and the land extending to Sutton-place\
        \ ; and forming the boundary on the west of Urswick-road to the churchyard,\
        \ were his two fields. He was the head of a large and flourishing family for\
        \ many years resident in Hackney ; and it is a fact worth noting, as showing\
        \ how easily by inter-marriages the middle class are linked with the \"upper\

        \ relation to our old parishioner, that the present Lord Settrington (grandson\

        \ the old, and thence by the old tower, once more I am tempted to mention\
        \ \" a find \" in the latter. When a short while ago in company with our excellent\
        \ Tyssen librarian, Mr. Chambers, and brother antiquarians Bradford and Ivatts,\
        \ I visited the old tower to examine the Dean vault, Mr. Chambers called our\
        \ attention to some strange lumber in what was the bell-ringers' chamber.\
        \ One article was a stage on wheels, small iron wheels about nine inches diameter\
        \ ; there had been four wheels, but only one seemed perfect ; on the platform\
        \ was a rough plank seat, in front of this was a frame work of stout wood\
        \ about three feec high with one crosspiece, supported by four uprights, all\
        \ strongly put together. Half-way up the two inner uprights were on each side\
        \ a pair of handcuffs let into the wood, and along the upper border of the\
        \ crosspiece three pairs of the same. One only solution as to the use of this\
        \ mysterious engine could be arrived at, and that was that here was the identical\

        did, returning often the same night. No doubt the long rides were good for
        both, and saved apoplectic fits, for they were notorious two-bottle-port men
        ; and though Lord Stowell was less free when he had to provide the wine, yet,
        as his brother, Lord Eldon, once wittily said of him, " He could drink any
        given quantity." Lord Stowell was a mighty eater as well, but as Mr. Surtees
        said of him, "The feats which he " performed with the knife and fork were
        eclipsed by those which he afterwards " displayed with the bottle." An anecdote
        of Mr. Howman, Vicar of Shiplake, is that one day going to Henley to catch
        the coach to Oxford, in order to record his vote for the county, he found
        all the places taken, and no vehicle available to reach Oxford in time, whereupon
        the ostler observed there was an undergraduate in the town who had driven
        in tandem, and perhaps he would give him a seat. Mr. Howman sought the young
        man out, who willingly agreed, on the condition that when they got to Oxford
        Mr. Howman should drive the tandem through the streets to the stable. This
        was to save his being reprimanded, as undergraduates were forbidden to drive
        tandem in Oxford; hence the leader would have had to be removed from his place
        to avoid the chance of the Dons or Proctors seeing it. Mr. Howman agreed,
        though from what his grandson says, he was a poor coachman, and boldly drove
        the tandem up the High Street to its stable, to the astonishment and amusement
        of many of his clerical and lay friends who were in for the poll. He did not
        hear the last of it for some time, and it is recorded that it was the first
        and last time he adventured such a feat 1 One day in or about the year 1846,
        Mr. Howman and his two friends, the Misses Knyvett, of Sonning, were walking
        under the walnut trees near the church, then called " the orchard," when they
        saw a little lady leaning on a stick, and accompanied by the clever but eccentric-looking
        bookseller and librarian of Reading, Mr. Lovejoy, ascending the hill from
        the river. They approached, and the lady was introduced to Mr. Howman as Miss
        Mitford, the authoress of Our Village, &c. She was welcomed to the Vicarage
        and shown the garden, church, &c. She has left an account of her visit to
        Shiplake on this occasion : in her Recollections of a Literary Life she thus
        describes her visit : " Our way, however, leads straight on. A few miles further,
        and a turn to the " right conducts us to one of the grand old village churches
        which give so " much character to English landscape. A large and beautiful
        pile it is; the " tower, half clothed with ivy, standing, with its charming
        Vicarage and its " pretty garden, on an eminence overhanging one of the finest
        bends of the " great river. A woody lane leads from the church to the bottom
        of the " chalk cliff, one side of which stands out from the road below, like
        a " promontory, surmounted by the laurel hedges and flowery arbours of the
        " Vicarage garden, and crested by a noble cedar of Lebanon. This is Ship "
        lake church, famed far and near for its magnificent oak carving, and the "
        rich painted glass of its windows, collected long before such adornments',

        however, he had not been long about his manuscript when a door opened and
        the Prince stepped into the apartment. The doctor watched him as he drew near,
        receiving, from each of the embayed windows in succession, a flush of morning
        sun ; and Otto looked so gay, and walked so airily, he was so well dressed
        and brushed and frizzled, so point-device, and of such a sovereign elegance,
        that the heart of his cousin the recluse was rather moved against him. ''Good-morning,
        Gotthold,'' said Otto, dropping in a chair. '' Good-morning, Otto,'' returned
        the librarian. 4 You are an early bird. Is this an accident, or do you begin
        reforming ? '' ''- It is about time, I fancy,'' answered the Prince. '' I
        cannot imagine,'' said the Doctor. '' I am too sceptical to be an ethical
        adviser ; and as for good resolutions, I believed in them when I was young.

        said Otto, '' I am not a popular sovereign.'' And with a look he changed his
        statement to a question. ''Popular? Well, there I would distinguish,'' answered
        Gotthold, leaning back and joining the tips of his fingers. ''There are various

        \ row near the High Street, and yvas afterwards known as ' the auld Pedagogy.\
        \ ' Though this budding survived till the middle of the present century, the\
        \ University did not long remain in it. Probably it became too small for the\
        \ increasing number of students, for in 1458 a piece of land was rented on\
        \ the E side of High Street for the erection of a new Pedagogy. The endowment\
        \ was, however, so poor that the governing body could not provide money to\
        \ pay for their accommodation, and this having been brought under the notice\
        \ of the pro prietor of the new site, James, first Lord Hamilton, he in 1459\
        \ made them a present of the ground \u2014 on yvhich afterwards the old University\
        \ buildings, on the site of the College Station, were erected \u2014 together\
        \ with four acres of land in Dow Hill or Dove Hill, adjoining the Jlolendinar\
        \ Burn, on condition that twice every day the regents and students should\
        \ pray for Lord Hamilton's soul, and also that of his wife Euphemia; aud that,\
        \ if a chapel were built in the college, the regents and students should therein\
        \ on their bended knees sing an ave to the Virgin, with a collect and remembrance\
        \ for the same persons. No buildings probably were erected on this ground\
        \ ; but the existing houses having been adapted as yvell as possible for their\
        \ neyv purpose, the University migrated thither in 1465. In 1475 the grounds\
        \ yvere still farther enlarged by the addition of land on the N belonging\
        \ to Sir Thomas Arthurlie, and bequeathed by him to the University. On the\
        \ front portion of this, houses yvere afterwards erected for the professors.\
        \ The Reformation almost ruined the struggling home of learning, for as it\
        \ was, like all the universities of the time, chiefly sup ported by, and an\
        \ instrument of, the Church, the students disappeared when the churchmen fled.\
        \ In 1563 Queen JIary made over to it some of the confiscated lands of the\
        \ Church, being moved thereto, as the charter narrates, by the half-finished\
        \ condition of the buildings, and the fact that all provision for the poor\
        \ bursars and masters had ceased, so that the yvhole place had rather the\
        \ appearance of the decay of a university than an established foundation.\
        \ By this charter five bursaries were founded for poor youths, and the manse\
        \ and ' kirk-room' of the Black Friars, with 13 acres of land in the Dove\
        \ Hill and certain rents that had belonged to the friars, were granted for\
        \ the maintenance of the masters. Notwithstanding this, however, the Univer\
        \ sity had in 1571 only about a dozen students and an income of about \xA3\
        25 sterling, and in that year the magistrates, taking its state into pitiful\
        \ consideration, granted it some of the church lands yvhich they had received\
        \ at the Reformation, a grant which yvas con firmed by Parliament. It does\
        \ not seem to have been popular among the common people, for yve find mention\
        \ of a charge made against three Glasgow bailies named Colin Campbell, AVilliam\
        \ Heygate, and Archibald Hey gate, who were alleged to have been ringleaders\
        \ of a mob that burst into the University and shed the blood of several of\
        \ the students who successfully resisted their attempts to set the building\
        \ on fire. In 1574 Andrew Jlelvil became principal, and tried to throw some\
        \ new spirit into matters ; but nothing could be done yvithout money, so the\
        \ Regent Jlorton, stirred up by him, in 1577 advised King James VI. , then\
        \ in his minority, to issue a new deed of erection, and to make a considerable\
        \ grant in aid of the college revenue, consisting of the tithes, manse, glebe,\
        \ and church lands of the rectory and vicar age of the parish of Govan. The\
        \ new regulations follow ing on the neyv constitution provided that the students\
        \ were to use Latin as their ordinary language, and were to rise at five in\
        \ the morning and be in bed at a quarter past nine. They were allowed to play\
        \ golf and to practise archery and dramatic representations, but not to play\
        \ with cards or dice or at billiards, nor were they to bathe. Some buildings\
        \ are said to have been erected in 1593, but nothing is known of them, and\
        \ the old college buildings, entirely demolished to make way for she College\
        \ station, were not erected till 1630. Meanwhile private individuals had been\
        \ increasing tho funds of the authorities. In 1610 one of the regents, named\
        \ Boyd, bequeathed 1000 merks to aid in the erection of buildings; and in\
        \ 1617 a large bequest yvas also made by a citizen named AVilson for the same\
        \ pur pose, while Archbishop Law increased the revenues, and presented many\
        \ books to the library. In 1626 Dr John Strang became principal, and by his\
        \ exertions consider able funds were obtained in aid of the building fund.\
        \ The subscriptions were mostly from the nobility and \"entry in the AV, and\
        \ amounted to the sum \u2014 for those days a very large one \u2014 of \xA3\
        2000 sterling. There was a contribution of \xA3200 promised by King Charles\
        \ I., and, curiously enough the sum yvas paid by Oliver Cromwell in 1654,\
        \ the Protector further granting \xA3500 on his own behalf. The buildings\
        \ yvere begun in 1632, and carried on as the funds permitted, work never being\
        \ stopped altogether, though sometimes it proceeded but slowly. Some thought\
        \ the structure yvas on too magnificent a scale, and, notwithstanding the\
        \ extra money obtained from the grant by Cromwell of the revenues of the bishopric\
        \ of Galloway, and a further sum of 200 merks yearly from the customs of the\
        \ city, the governing body found themselves by-and-by over 15,000 merks (more\
        \ than \xA31300) in debt. The old buildings were Jacobean in style, and before\
        \ the Union Railway Company took possession they showed three quadrangular\
        \ courts, the upper storeys being reached by staircases yvith massive stone\
        \ balustrades. The front was 305 feet long ; the grand archway yvas surmounted\
        \ by a stone balcony sup ported on corbels, and the upper storey had dormer\
        \ windows with carved pediments. Over the entrance yvere the royal arms of\
        \ the time of Charles II. The first quadrangle was all old, and a stone staircase\
        \ in one of the corners led up to a iarge panelled hall used for business\
        \ meetings, and containing a feyv portraits. The second quadrangle yvas entered\
        \ by an archway beneath the steeple, which yvas 148 feet high, and the buildings\
        \ in it presented a somewhat incongruous mixture of ancient and modern. The\
        \ steeple yvas not a very elegant structure, but some interest attached to\
        \ the lightning conductor, which yvas erected in 1772 under the auspices of\
        \ the famous Benjamin F*ranklin. The third quadrangle contained the library\
        \ and one or two class-rooms, but the greater portion of it yvas merely separated\
        \ from the college park hy railings. Standing apart in it was the building\
        \ containing the Hunterian JIuseum, a classical structure erected in 1804,\
        \ and adorned in front yvith a hexastyle Doric portico. Besides these three\
        \ quad rangles, there was at the N side, with a separate entrance from High\
        \ Street, a fourth containing thirteen dwelling houses for professors. The\
        \ college park spread away to the E, yvith pleasant yvalks shaded with frees.\
        \ It was used for the recreation of the students, and is the spot selected\
        \ by Sir AValter Scott in Rob Roy as the scene of the duel between Francis\
        \ and Rashleigh Osbaldistone. Of the buildings just mentioned there had been\
        \ erected, between 1632 and 1660, the inner court, the steeple, three professors'\
        \ houses \u2014 for the principal and the two divinity professors \u2014 and\
        \ a portion of the AV front, toyvards tne roofing of yvhich the town council\
        \ con tributed \xA32000 Scots. The number of students yvas considerable, and\
        \ their intellectual wants yvere attended to by a principal, eight professors,\
        \ and a librarian. The Restoration brought with it fresh troubles for Glasgow-\
        \ University, for the re-introduction of Episcopacy brought with it the loss\
        \ of the revenues granted by Cromwell, and the debt contracted in the building\
        \ operations proved such a heavy burden that three out of the eight professorships\
        \ had to be abolished and the emoluments of the five that were left considerably\
        \ reduced. From 1660 onyvards the University continued to receive many benefactions,\
        \ but most of them took the form of foundations of new bursaries, the most\
        \ im portant being the foundation of the valuable Snell Ex hibitions. This\
        \ yvas in 1677, when John Snell of Uffeton, a Scotchman and an alumnus of\
        \ Glasgow, bequeathed tho funds arising from an estate in AVarwickshiro for\
        \ the edu cation of Glasgow students at Balliol College, Oxford,", 1]

        \ the first time at the memorable \xABMay Festival* ofthe students on the\
        \ 13th of May of that year. (See pp. 177, 289). With undiminished interest\
        \ for his art, Pacius continued his work as composer up to his closing years.\
        \ He had the satisfaction of seeing his opera, Loreley, (written the year\
        \ before to words by Em. Geibel) put on the stage in 1887. Four years later,\
        \ he closed a long, honourable, and active career, and was mourned as the\
        \ father of Finnish music. The art which Pacius founded and practised in our\
        \ land was not national in the proper sense of the word. What his inspiration\
        \ calls forth, will probably bear the stamp of the national type of mind,\
        \ but his own contributions to our artistic life are principally- gifts from\
        \ the abundance of a greater, richer people. This German influence, so noticeable\
        \ in many spheres of our civilization, and particularly- in music, was also\
        \ strengthened by the composer who stood next in importance to Pacius, Konrad\
        \ Greve (1820 \u2014 1851). Born in Germany, and having studied under Ferd.\

        \ of the Musical Society at Abo. which had again been revived. In this capacity,\
        \ and especially- as composer, he carried out much effective and important\
        \ work, not withstanding the short life allotted to him. His chief works are:\
        \ \u2014 the music of Sommarnatten (The Summer Night, 1847), and the saga-play,\
        \ Systrarne pd Kinnekulle (The Sisters of Kinnekulle, 1850), to the text by\
        \ N. H. Pinello, and to F. Berndtson's Historic-Romantic play-, Ur lifvcts\
        \ strid (From the Battle of Life. 1851). This last-named play- was memorable\
        \ also in the history of our art, as the first occasion when the Bjdr'neborgarne's\
        \ March, now probably- the most popular song in all Scandinavia and Finland,\
        \ was first publicly performed after 1809, and much of its success is due\
        \ to Greve's beautiful music. The Spohr-Mendelssohn tradition, represented\
        \ by Pacius and Greve, was not the immediate cause of the origin of any school\
        \ of music here. Though the works of these two masters were received with\
        \ gratitude and admiration, the requirements of the public were still too\
        \ small to force the national pro duction over the level of dilettantism,\
        \ and the love of art among us was not strong enough to offer any pecuniary\
        \ recompense to the earnest worker in the field of music. Among the amateurs\
        \ whose compositions won success about this time may- be named Fredrik August\
        \ Ehrstrom (T801 \u2014 1850), organist at Helsingfors, and Axel Gabriel Ingelius\
        \ (1822 \u2014 1868). They devoted themselves chiefly to song composition,\
        \ and Ehrstrom's Vid en kalla (At a Well), and Ingelius' charming Vdrsdng\

        \ of the Kalevala, Karl Collan (1828 \u2014 1871), Librarian of the Helsingfors\
        \ University, also made his musical debut as an amateur. Gifted with exceptional\

        \ by his scientific researches in the field of national song. His compositions,\

        \ and established at the Lutheran Universities of Germany long reigned paramount\
        \ at the University of Abo. It consisted of a scholasticism somewhat simplified\
        \ and relieved of a good deal of foolish hair-splitting, but still related\
        \ to that of the Middle Ages, though the orthodoxy- it acknowledged was no\
        \ longer Roman-Catholic but Lutheran- Evangelical. New philosophical movements\
        \ were eagerly- repressed and kept in check, the Cartesian philosophy-, favoured\
        \ by the naturalists, was considered specially heretical and, therefore, very\
        \ much dreaded. Not until the eighteenth century could the systems which had\
        \ sprung from the soil of the modern age, gain a footing at the Finnish University.\
        \ The system of Leibnitz-Wolf was first introduced, that of Locke later on.\
        \ H. G. Porthan, with his immense learning and wonderful tutorial powers,\
        \ whose name has already been mentioned several times in these pages, took\
        \ a warm interest in the training of Finnish youth, including also their philosophical\
        \ studies: so warm, indeed, that he was induced to give lectures in \u2014\
        \ among other subjects \u2014 logic, psychology, \xE6sthetics, natural law,\
        \ and pedagogics. His standpoint was, however, less that of the severe systematizer\
        \ than that of the popularizing eclectic. He adhered to Locke's philosophy-\
        \ of experience, but without arriving at the materialistic conclusions w-hich\
        \ some French thinkers had extracted from this philosophy. \u2014 Porthan\
        \ lived long enough to experience the revolution brought about towards the\
        \ end of the eighteenth century by Kant and his -critical* philosophy-, but\
        \ he was no friend of the new movement, and his influence was so great that\
        \ while he lived there was no chance for the philosophy of Kant at the University\
        \ of Abo. Shortly- after the death of Porthan there appeared, however, a phenomenon,\
        \ hitherto unique in the literary- history of Finland \u2014 an attempt to\
        \ produce a new philosophical system, independent of all predecessors. The\
        \ originator of this bold scheme was Gabriel Israel Hartman (b. 1776), the\

        \ -Docent- of Philosophy. He was made Librarian of the University, but unfortunately\
        \ died in 1809 at the age of thirty-three. Hartman wrote a Geography which\
        \ was very popular in the schools of Finland and Sweden and went through no\
        \ fewer than ten editions. He tried all sorts of literary- work, but the subject\
        \ of his choice was philosophy. He published some academic dissertations and\
        \ a great philosophical work. Kunskapsldra (The Doctrine of Knowledge), two\
        \ volumes of which were issued in 1807 \u2014 08. The third volume, w-hich\

        \ Hcrtig Johan och hans tid (Duke John and his Time), relates the history-\

        \ by these authors upon political events and public life at different periods,\
        \ others devoted themselves to the study and revision of literary- treasures\
        \ and their history. Sven Gabriel Elmgren (b. 181 7. Vice Librarian) published\
        \ Ofversigt as Finlands litteratur (Review of the Literature of Finland, two\
        \ volumes, 1861 and 1865), and wrote literary treatises and biographies. The\
        \ work, Finlands minnesvarda man (The Worthies of Finland), published by several\
        \ authors who wished to popularize the history- of Finland in a biographical\
        \ form, contains monographs on several bishops by the last-named author. The\

        \ Kcllgrens finska lefnadsminucn (Finnish Recollections of the Poet J. H.\

        \ mention. \u2014 The prolific writer in the Finnish language, Julius Krohn,\
        \ whose other literary- merits will be recounted later on, wrote a history\
        \ of Finnish folklore and Finnish literature. With the exception of G. Rein's\

        \ Historians from the time of Porthan in a clear and lucid resume. G. Z. Forsman's\
        \ Oppikirja Suomen kansan historiassa (History of the Finnish People, a Manual,\
        \ 1869 \u2014 1872) therefore was most welcome. This work, partly founded\
        \ on independent research, partly utilizing the labours of others, was translated\
        \ into German in 1873, into Swedish in 1874 and appeared in a second Finnish\
        \ edition in 1881 \u2014 82. In political life the author now occupied a position\
        \ as one of the principal leaders of the Finnish party, and his historical\
        \ writings were naturally influenced by his relations to party questions.\
        \ The fortunes of the Finnish people and its development into a separate nation\

        \ the introduction into Finland of Swedish legislation and general culture,\
        \ as well as the participation of our country in Swedish political life, was\
        \ more injurious to the development of the purely Finnish element than advantageous\
        \ to the growth of the nation as a whole. Many reviewers have considered this\
        \ view of the subject one-sided and narrow, but on the other hand it has been\
        \ much commended by the political adherents of the author. His position and\
        \ opinions were even more clearly discernible in a later work entitled Yrjo\
        \ Maunu Sprengt porteuista ja Suomen itsendisyydestd (Goran Magnus Sprengtporten\
        \ and the Independence of Finland, 1870). His sympathy- with the aim Sprengtporten\
        \ had in view \u2014 Finland's independence \u2014 makes the author ascribe\
        \ to all his actions the noblest possible motives. The principal reviewer\

        \ a series of articles, founded on researches in the archives, which established\
        \ beyond a doubt the egotism and self-seeking of Sprengtporten's motives.\

        \ IN FINLAND. Sincerely alive to the great importance the Swedish language\
        \ has exercised and still exercises in the history of Finland's civilization,\
        \ a number of scholars, authors and representatives of the Estates issued,\
        \ in 1885, an invitation to the friends of the Swedish civilization in this\
        \ country to establish a Swedish Literary Society. We quote the following\
        \ from this invitation: -The Swedish civilization in Finland has a long and\
        \ exceptionally- beautiful history. It has had not only great and illustrious\
        \ champions, such as Gezelius, Porthan, Franzen and Runeberg, but also a great\
        \ number of less important, long forgotten workers, whose lifelong but unostentatious\
        \ labour forms the foundation of the culture of the present day. It has at\
        \ different times followed different currents and been subject to different\
        \ influences, such as the clerical during the time of the Charles's, the enlightened\
        \ rationalism of the last century, and the devoted national spirit \u2014\
        \ prepared for any amount of self-sacrifice \u2014 of this century. From these\
        \ movements sprang the patriotic spirit which has developed and still maintains\
        \ our free institutions and has nursed into life. by the side of the Swedish\
        \ civilization, the first youthful aspirations towards a Finnish one. \xAB\
        The evidences of this work of centuries have never been properly collected\
        \ or wrought into shape. This is the case more especially with literature.\
        \ The origin and development of the educational estab lishments form another\
        \ field for research. Investigation of the various Swedish dialects, and of\
        \ the tales and songs and all the folklore belonging to them, has begun, but\
        \ is far from having been brought to a conclusion. To carry on this work will\
        \ be the chief object of the Swedish Literary- Society in Finland . The invitation\
        \ was warmly responded to by the public. At the constituent meeting on the\
        \ 7th of May, 1885. the President had the pleasure of informing those present\
        \ that the members of the Society already numbered 1.066, and that their different\
        \ contributions amounted to the sum of 144.950 marks. Later on the funds were\
        \ increased through a member, Victor Hockert, leaving to the Society a legacy\
        \ of 81.500 marks \u2014 the whole of his fortune. At the same meeting the\
        \ proposed Rules were adopted for -The Swedish Literary Society in Finland*,\
        \ established in memory of Johan Ludvig Runeberg. According to these Rules,\
        \ the object of the Society is to collect evidences of the origin and development\
        \ of the Swedish culture in Finland, such as unpublished or rare literary\
        \ works and manuscripts, Swedish folklore, information concerning old literary\
        \ societies and enterprises, historical Acts, specially concerning Instruction,\
        \ biographical notices, letters of historical or literary interest, and to\
        \ revise and publish all these collections; moreover, to promote the study\
        \ of the Swedish language by the investigations of popular dialects and through\
        \ the publication of suitable text-books, grammars, and readers ; and finally\
        \ to encourage Swedish literature by awarding subsidies to young and promising\
        \ authors and prizes for valuable literary productions. At the head of the\
        \ Society stands a Committee of 12, which elects among its members a yearly\
        \ President, Vice-President, Secretary, Librarian and Treasurer. Four of the\
        \ twelve members are every year subject to re-election. The publications of\
        \ the Society bear the common title of -Writings, published by the Swedish\
        \ Literary Society*, and are all delivered over to the members free of cost.\
        \ The annual meeting of the Society is held on the 5th of February, the birthday\
        \ of Runeberg. During the eight years of its existence the Society has developed\
        \ a great deal of energy. It has published no less than 23 tomes, all of importance\
        \ to the history- of our civilization. The following are the titles of some\
        \ of the most significant: Letters of H. G. Porthan to M. Calonius and The\

        \ world of ideas. Criticism has not remained neutral in its treatment of these\
        \ tendencies and changes in our literature. Since Snellman's Literary Paper\

        otherwise would inevitably have been lost. But this was not done without considerable
        opposition from the owners of houses who objected to their property being
        blown up if there was a chance of it being saved.1 At last the " horrid, malicious,
        bloody flame," des cribed by Pepys as so unlike the flame of an ordinary fire,
        burnt itself out, and at the close of Thursday, the 6th September, the inhabitants
        of the city were able for the first time since the outbreak to seek a night''s
        rest without fear of further danger. When they rose the next morning and contemplated
        the extent of the havoc wrought on their city by the fire, the hearts of many
        must have fairly sunk within them. At least four-fifths of the whole of the
        buildings situate within the walls had been reduced to ashes. The official
        report was that no less than 13,200 houses and eighty-nine parish churches,
        besides St. Paul''s and divers chapels, were destroyed, and that only seventy-five
        acres out of a total of 373 acres of ground within the walls escaped the conflagration.2
        These seventy-five acres chiefly lay in the vicinity of Aldgate and Tower
        Hill, and probably owed their immunity from the fire to the free use of gunpowder,
        for it was in Tower Street, Pepys tells us, that the practice of blowing up

        \ ADAMS.1 [ To the Editor of the \" National Intelligencer,\" Federal City.~]\
        \ Towards the latter end of last December I received a letter from a venerable\
        \ patriot, Samuel Adams, dated Bos ton, Nov. 30. It came by a private hand,\
        \ which I suppose was the cause of the delay. I wrote Mr. Adams an answer,\
        \ dated Jan. 1st, and that I might be certain of his receiving it, and also\
        \ that I might know of that reception, I desired a 1 The Hon. Samuel Adams\
        \ (1722-1803) was from the Stamp Act agitation of 1764 to the Declaration\
        \ of Independence in 1776 the pre-eminent revolutionary leader in Massachusetts,\
        \ and General Gage was given orders to send him over to London, where a newspaper\
        \ predicted that his head would appear on Temple Bar. He was sent by Massachusetts,\
        \ with his cousin, John Adams, afterwards President, to the first Continental\
        \ Congress (1774), where he was suspected, with justice, of being favorable\
        \ to separation from England. When Paine published his famous appeal for American\
        \ Independence (January 10, 1776), Samuel Adams was the first member of the\
        \ Congress at his side, and a cordial lifelong relation existed between the\
        \ two. It is to my mind certain that these two men were the real pioneers\
        \ of American Independence, and they were both inspired therein by their widely\
        \ different religious sentiments. Samuel Adams was the son of a deacon of\
        \ the Old South Church, Boston, who sent his son to Harvard College with the\
        \ hope that he would graduate into a minister. The son had no taste for theology,\
        \ but he made up for it by retaining through all his career as a lawyer and\
        \ public man a rigid Puritanism, of which the first article was hatred of\
        \ the British system of royalty and prelacy. While Adams's desire for American\
        \ independency was largely an inheritance from New England Puritans, Paine\
        \ beheld in it a means of establishing a Republic based on the principles\
        \ of Quakerism, \u2014 the divine Light in every man by virtue of which all\
        \ were equal. Samuel Adams died October 2, 1803. The correspondence here given\
        \ was printed in the National Intelligencer, Washington City, February 2,\
        \ 1803, as one of a series of Ten Letters addressed to \" The Citizens of\
        \ the United States \" on his return after his fifteen eventful years in Europe.\
        \ These Letters were printed in a pamphlet in London, 1804, by his friend\
        \ Thomas Clio Rickman, whose task, however, was achieved under sad intimidation.\
        \ Rick man's preface opens with the words: \" The following little work would\
        \ not have been published, had there been anything in it the least offending\
        \ against the government or individuals.\" Under this deadly fear the much\
        \ prosecuted Rickman mutilated Paine's letter to Adams a good deal. I have\
        \ been fortun ate in being able to print the letter from Paine's own manuscript,\
        \ which was recently discovered among the papers of George Bancroft, the historian,\
        \ when they passed into the possession of the Lenox Library, New York, to\
        \ whose ex cellent librarian I owe thanks for this and other favors.\u2014\

        debtors'' prison, has already in these pages been amply described. Nor should
        we omit to mention the military prison of the Rue du Cherche-Midi ; the prison
        of cell confinement, children and youths ,_,lllit\ for the most part, as M.
        Jules Simon m presses it, of having had unnatural parents. In taking a leisurely
        survey of the principal PRISON OF LA SANTIi. Paris prisons, we may begin with
        La Roquette as the most formidable in character. Situated in the street and
        place of the same name, built towards 1837, and on such a perfecl that there
        has hitherto been no example ol prisoner''s escape or even attempted escape
        from it. This gaol, therefore, is to criminals 01 the most redoubtable. The
        gloomy impres however, which it may well produce on a stra are somewhat relieved
        by the fact thai courtyard by which it is approached is adorned with a fountain,
        and that the prison boa well composed library of sonic two volumes ; nor,
        since crime is so often the outcome of ignorance, could a wiser means ol recreation
        for the convicts be devised. the librarian is usually a convict who certain
        education, and who has earned tin of confidence by repentance and good behaviour.

        \ before being formally admitted, to take the following oath :\u2014 who was\
        \ not an ardent supporter ot the ancient monarchy was called a Jacobin. But\
        \ though towards the end of the Revolution Jacobinism became something hateful\
        \ indeed, the principles which first brought the Jacobins together were such\
        \ a- neither lovers of liberty nor lovers of order could object to. \" I swear\
        \ to live free or die ; to remain faithful to the principles of the Constitution\
        \ ; to obey the laws ; to cause them to be respected ; to help with all my\
        \ might to make them perfect ; and to conform to the customs ami i tions of\
        \ the society.\" In 1780 a number of popular associations were rapidly organised\
        \ ; this being the natural result ofthe reactionary feeling against a system\
        \ which had subjected book-, newspapers, and even con versation 111 public\
        \ places (such as cafes) to a rigid censorship supported by officials and\
        \ by spies. A pas-ion suddenly arose throughout France for public speaking,\
        \ and in a thousand different assemblies orators were formed. The States-General\
        \ had just met; and, not content with the formal sitting-, the deputies loved\
        \ to address in a direct manner the outside public. With thi- view, the deputies\
        \ from Brittany established a club called the Breton Club, which wa- joined\
        \ In other deputies, and which pre sently changed its title to \"Society of\
        \ the Friends of the Constitution.\" This association included men of all\
        \ shades of politics, who were afterward- to make war upon one another. Among\
        \ tin nio-t famous may be- mentioned Sieves, Volney, Barnave, Petion, Barrere,\
        \ Lameth, Robespierre, the Duke of Orleans (Philippe Egalite), tin Duke de\
        \ La Rochefoucauld, Boissy d'Anglas, Talleyrand, I. a Fayette, and Mirabeau.\
        \ flic Societ) had it- head-quarters at Versailles, 111 ,1 building called\
        \ Le Reposoir, which, later ;m, became a Protestant church. The sitting- were\
        \ held, first three, then four times a week. Little by little, however, the\
        \ usual course in such assemblies was drifted into, The leaders went to extremes,\
        \ and soon the most extravagant ofthem obtained the largest follow ing. Then\
        \ the moderate members retii form counter-associations, until in time tin\
        \ hostile organisations made war upon one another, with the guillotine as\
        \ their final weapon. \"The Jacobins,\" says Michelet, \"by their esprit i/e\
        \ corps, which went on constantly in creasing, by their r hardened, uncompron\
        \ faith, by their li.nsh, inquisitorial wa) something of a priestly character.\
        \ They so a sort of revolutionary clergy.\" Another great admirer of the Revolution,\
        \ and especially of Robespierre, in whom the principle of Jacobinism was incarnate,\
        \ sums up the. I. spirit in the following words : \u2014 \"Hatred of the conventional\
        \ inequalities ut former times, of unalterable beliefs, a sort \"I methodical\
        \ fanaticism, intolerance of all that interfered with the development of thi\
        \ daring innovations, and, fundamentally, .1 | for regular forms; these, whatever\
        \ may bi on the subject, were the components ol tin Jacobin spirit. The true-\
        \ Jacobin had something about him at once powerful, original and sombre, He\
        \ stood midway between the agitator and the statesman; between the Protestant\
        \ an Monk; between the inquisitor and the tribune. Hence that ferocious vigilance\
        \ transformed into a virtue : that spy system raised to the rank of a patriotic\
        \ organisation : and that mania for d' ciation, which made people at first\
        \ laugh at last tremble.\" After the days of October the Assembly fol lowed\
        \ the King to Paris ; and the famous club was established, first in a large\
        \ hall which served as library to the Dominican monks at the convent of the\
        \ Rue Saint-Honore, and afterwards, when tin- order had been dissolved, in\
        \ the Convent Church. As the- Dominicans were more generally spoken ot as\
        \ the Jacobins, the latter name was -nun applied to the Friends of the Constitution,\
        \ who willingly adopt '1 it. The same thing, strangely enough, happened to\
        \ the Cordeliers and the Feuillants ; so that the principal Revo lutionary\
        \ parties got to be known throughout Europe by appellations formerly monastic.\
        \ France, like England soon afterwards, had its . Inti-facobin. Les Sabbats\
        \ Jacobites was th of the French publication, and the Jai \" mania for denunciation\"\
        \ was thus satirised it What is still more curious is that the last of the\
        \ Jacobin monks (in 1789 and 1 7<io ) took part in the meetings of which their\
        \ convent was the scene, as, in like manner, did the last members ot the <\
        \ trderof Cordeliers. The Jacobin Club possessed a large staff of officers,\
        \ including a president, vice-president, four secretaries, twelve its columns\

        \ Appeal, the Court of Assizes, the Tribunalol First Instance, and the Tribunal\
        \ of Police. These fill the halls of the immense building. The Court of Cassation,\
        \ divided into three chambers, counts forty-eight counsellors, a first president,\
        \ three presidents of chamber, a curator-general, six advocates-general, a\

        \ history of the Palais de Justice is marked by the fires 'in which it has\
        \ from time to time been burned down. The first of th. out on the night of\
        \ the -th of March, l6l8, when the principal hall and most of the building\
        \ adjoining it were destroyed. The second, due took place on the 27th of October,\
        \ 1737, sinned the buildings forming the Chamber 0 Accounts, situated at the\
        \ bottom ot I yard of the Sainte-Chapelle-an edifice of sur passing beauty,\
        \ constructed in the fiftee century by Jean Joconde, a monk ot the U of Saint\
        \ Dominic. The Palais de Justice of the present day oc cupies about one third\
        \ of the total surface ot the Cite. Enclosed on the east by the Boulevard\
        \ du Palais, on the west by the Rue dc Harlay, on the north by the Ouai de\
        \ l'Horloge, and on the south bv the Ouai des Orfevres, it forms a quadrilateral\
        \ mass in which all styles arc opposed and confused, from the feudal towers\
        \ of the Ouai de l'Horloge to the new buildings begun in Napoleon III.'- reign,\
        \ but never completed. To the left of this strange agglomeration the air is\
        \ pierced bv the graceful spire of the Sainte-Chapelle, admirable monument\
        \ of the piety and ofthe art ofthe middle ages. Sonic portions of the ancient\
        \ Palace of Justice are preserved in the modern edifice, but only the substructures,\
        \ as, for instance, in the northern building- faeing the Seine. The principal\
        \ gate, and the central pavilion with its admirable facade at the bottom of\
        \ the courtyard opening mi to the Boulevard du Palais, were constructed under\
        \ the reign of Louis XVI. The northern portion, from the clock tower, at the\
        \ corner of the quay, to the third tower behind, has been restored or rebuilt\
        \ in the course of the last thirty year-. All the rest of the building is\
        \ absolutely new. The clock tower, a fine specimen of the military architecture\
        \ of the fourteenth century, was furnished in 1370 lw order of Charles V.\
        \ with the first large clock that had been seen in Parb-, the work of a German,\
        \ called in France Henri de Vic. To this clock the northern quay owes it-\
        \ name of \"Ouai de l'Horloge du Palais\" or \"Ouai de l'Horloge.\" The bell\
        \ suspended in the upper part of the tower is said to have sounded the signal\
        \ for the massacre of the Protestants on the eve of St. Bartholo mew's Day,\
        \ August 24, 1572 ; a doubtful honour, which is also claimed for the bell\
        \ of Saint-Germain -l'Auxerrois. The Palais de Justice, as it now exists,\
        \ possesses a threefold character \u2014 legal, administrative, and punitive.\

        \ kind of book he wants. However 1 and however attentive a librarian may-\
        \ is not likely to make his researches with -iduitvand care as the earnest\
        \ student lied with one sole object. On the other 1 be librarian, as a man\
        \ of learning, will know the literature of any one subject better than tbe\
        \ ordinary student, and much better than the I r< ader. The most important\
        \ edifice in the Rue Vi vienne \u2014 or, rather, in the open space which\
        \ a portion of the Rue Vivienne faces \u2014 is the Bourse, or Exchange, of\
        \ which the architecture so closely resembles that of the Madeleine. Yet there\
        \ is nothing in the Bourse to suggest a house of prayer. At the entrance of\
        \ the St. Petersburg Bourse stands a chapel, in which the operator for the\
        \ rise or for the fall may invoke the pro tection ot Heaven for the success\
        \ of his own particular speculation. The noise of the dealers crying out prices\
        \ and shouting offers and accept ances is far less suggestive of the \" House\
        \ of (rod\" than of a \"den of thieves,\" to which, it must be feared, it\
        \ presents in many respects a considerable likeness. the National Library\
        \ of the Rue Richelieu, Paris possesses the Mazarin Library, the Library of\
        \ the Arsenal, of Sainte-Genevieve, of the Institute, of the Town, of the\
        \ Louvre, ofthe National Assembly, of the Senate, and ut a number of museums\
        \ and learned societies. 'The origin of the word \"Bourse,\" which ha- been\
        \ adopted by almost every country in Europe, with the striking exception ot\
        \ England, seems evident enough, though it would be- a mi-take to suppose\
        \ that it is derived from bourse, a purse. According to the best etymologist,\
        \ the name of Bourse comes from the Exchange estab lished in the sixteenth\
        \ century at Bruges in the of one Van der Bourse, who, in tlie well known\
        \ punning spirit of heraldry, had adopted for his arms three bourses or purses.\

        \ fold their arms I. ne at him until he desists and leaves 10 their sepulchral\
        \ pursuits. Both in France and in England the public libraries have two other\
        \ classes ot readers. First, The most ancient Bourse in France is said to\
        \ be that of Lyons ; and the next ancient that of Toulouse, which dates from\
        \ 1540. The Bourse of Rouen was established a few years later, while that\
        \ of Paris was not legally constituted until 1 7-4- Paris, nevertheless, ha-\
        \ possessed since the sixteenth century several places of exchange : now on\
        \ the Pont au Change, now in the 1,1 mit yard of the Palais de Justice, and\
        \ then for a considerable time at the Hotel de Soissons, in the Rue Ouincampoix,\
        \ which was the scene of the wild speculations in connection with Law's Mississipi\

        \ were offered up by the clergy, who headed a pro cession in which all the\
        \ Court, with the excep tion of Henri of Navarre, afterward- Henri 1\\ . of\
        \ France, took part. The King was congratu lated from the pulpit by the Bishop\
        \ of Asti on haying \"in one morning purged France ol heresy.\" Little did\
        \ the prelate foresee that the Church of Saint-Thomas ofthe Louvre in which\
        \ he was preaching would, some two centuries later, become the recognised\
        \ centre of this same heresy. Conde now abjured at Saint-Germain-des-Pres,\
        \ and Henri de Navarre at the Louvre ; but the Reformed Church was far from\
        \ being destroyed. Only a few months after the massacre, Berenger de Portal\
        \ left to this church (whose re-establish ment he ardently desired) a sum\
        \ sufficient for the maintenance of the pastors and the educa tion of candidates\
        \ for the ministry. In a room occupied at one time by tin Duk, de Sully are\
        \ preserved the archives of the Saint. Simonians, including the scaled memoirs\
        \ ot Le Pere Enfantin, which are not to be pub lished until thirty years after\
        \ his death; Enfantin's colossal bust in the style of Mi Angelo's Moses, a\

        \ Bourdon, thus named in memory of Colonel Bourdon, of the nth Dragoons, killed\
        \ at Austerlitz. , The building which now dominates all this district is the\
        \ Arsenal, built by the Emperor in 1K07 as a granary of reserve for provisioning\
        \ Paris; at present occupied by manufacturers and workmen of various kinds.\
        \ The Arsenal was erected on the site of the \" little arsenal,\" built by\
        \ Francis I. The new structure extends south to the Ouai Morland, so styled\
        \ in honour of the colonel of the Chasseurs of the Guard killed at Austerlitz.\
        \ Augmented and renovated by various architects, the Arsenal contains a library\
        \ of which the charming writer, Charles Nodier, was at one time the custodian.\
        \ The collection was first formed by M. d'Argenson and the Marquis de Paulmy,\
        \ Minister of State, who was the last Governor of the Arsenal before the suppre\u2014\
        \ imi of this military establishment by Louis XVI. in 1788, on the eve of\
        \ the Revolution. To gratify his own private tastes as a bibliophile, M. de\
        \ Paulmy had got together a library of about 100,000 volumes and 10,000 manuscripts,\
        \ which was increased by the addition of upwards of 26,000 works from the\
        \ sale of the Duke de la Valliere's collection. To prevent the dispersion\
        \ of the books after his death, M. de Paulmy sold the collection in 1783 to\
        \ the Count of Artois for a certain number of annuities, which the Count omitted\
        \ to pay. The library was, all the same, looked upon as government property,\
        \ and confiscated as such in 1700. Enriched by the confiscation of other libraries\
        \ in the neighbour- It was at the Arsenal, when Charles Xiulicr was librarian,\
        \ that Victor Hugo, in the 1111,1-1 of a great literary gathering, recited\
        \ his first poems, soon afterwards to be given to the world under the title\
        \ of \" ( )des et Ballad A complete list of the writers wlu> ha pied the post\

        \ known as Lc Bibliophile Jacob), Edouard Thierry, Hippo lyte Lucas, and the\
        \ Viscount de Bornier, author of \"La Fille de Roland,\" \"Agamemnon,\" \"\
        \ Attila,\" and \"Mahomet.\" Among the interesting places in the neigh bourhood\
        \ of the Arsenal must be mentioned the little covered market to which the\
        \ name of Ave Maria has been given. It marks the site ot the old tennis court\
        \ of the Black Cross, where Moliere erected his second theatre alter the failure\
        \ of the first ; and with so littli that he was imprisoned for debt contracted\
        \ m the name of the company. The Rue des Nonnains d'Hyeres, whi the Rue Saint-\
        \ Antoine, leads to thi by which the Seine is crossed to reach the Island\
        \ of Saint-Louis. Parallel to thi- street is the Rue Geoffrey Lasnier, which\
        \ is scarcely fiw and-twenty feet wide, and which has nothu whatever attractive\
        \ about it. Here, neverttt less, at No. 26, stands the hotel built by Constable\

        known of his parentage, except that he was of the Li family. His individual

        Upon the death of Mr. Noyes the management of the library came into the competent
        hands of W. A. Bardwell, who became librarian in 1888. The reading-rooms are

        there were 75,000 readers in 1893, and in the reading-rooms 100,000 readers.

        schools was inflamed, the city of Boston received the gift of some books from
        Paris, and con cluded that these documents were a proper nucleus for a free
        public library. In 1848 the General Court authorized the city to expend not
        exceeding $5,000 a year for such a purpose. In 1850 Edward Everett offered
        a thousand volumes of public documents, and Mayor Bigelow $1,000. In 1851
        the General Court authorized cities and towns to establish and maintain public
        libraries open to "the inhabitants there of," Boston being allowed to expend
        $28,000 the first year, and about $7,000 a year for maintenance. In 1852 Mayor
        Bigelow suggested the appointment of a librarian, whose work began May 13,
        and of trustees, whose first report led Joshua Bates to offer $50,000 toward
        the library, the city to find a suitable building. In the same year the permanent
        board of trustees was organized under an ordinance which called also for the
        annual election of a librarian by the city council. In 1853 the General Court
        authorized the expenditure of $150,000 for the library, up to December 31,
        1850, and $10,000 a year thereafter. In 1854 the library had the services
        of a librarian, who was chosen by the city council ; of trustees chosen in
        the same way ; of commissioners who were to provide the library building ;
        and of the usual committee, with the mayor left off. The circulating department
        was opened on May 2, 1854. On January 1, 1858, the library building in Boylston
        street was dedicated; in 1803 the trustees were authorized to appoint the
        librarian and superintendent, subject to the approval of the city- council;
        in 1869 the trustees received authority to appoint their subordinates, but
        the city council was represented in the board up to 1885. The law limit ing
        the library expenses to $10, (loo a year had been repealed in 1857, and in
        1878 the trustees were incorporated, with leave to hold property up to $1,000,000.
        In 1880 the State gave a piece of land for the erection of a new library building,
        at the corner of Boylston and Dartmouth streets, the building to be erected
        within three years, and to be open to all the citizens of the Commonwealth.
        This estate has been added to by the city, and in 1887 the trustees were given
        entire control of the new building, its erection and management. In 1809 the
        city had authorized them to establish branch libraries; but up to 1803 the
        ordinance vested in the trustees only "the general care and control of the
        public library," and in the librarian its "immediate care and custody7." So

        aide of the building as a business office, its press room being in a brick
        addition at the rear of the building. At one time a part of the building was
        occupied by the Farmers'' (fe Merchants'' Bank, which sub sequently closed
        its doors. The staff of the Globe then included many men who have since made

        \ More than one German artillery officer assured me that orders were daily\

        \ cut through one of the beams which supported the two upper floors. On reaching\
        \ the Place Kleber, one of the largest and finest open spaces in Strasburg,\
        \ the signs of destruction were most striking. The hand some building which\
        \ filled the north-eastern side of the square, and in which was a valuable\
        \ museum of ancient and modern works of art, is now repre sented by empty\
        \ walls. Nearly every house has been pierced with shot or shell. The hotel\
        \ in which I write this, the well-known Maison Rouge, has been struck more\
        \ than once. Being one of the first civilians who anived here, I succeeded\
        \ in getting one of the few rooms which the German officers had not taken\
        \ possession of. Wishing to breakfast, I called for the bill of fare. It was\
        \ as long and elaborate as usual. I came to the con- clusion that, although\
        \ the city had been severely injured by the bombardment, the inhabitants had\
        \ been able to procure not only the necessaries, but also the luxuries, of\
        \ life. But I was soon unde- ceived. The bill of fare was a relic of pre-siege\
        \ days. I could get beef or ham or pate de foie gras. Towards the end of the\
        \ siege, when provisions became very scarce, pate de foie gras was one of\
        \ the most common articles of food. Large stores of it, intended for exportation,\
        \ had accumulated. Coffee The destruction of the Library was more par ticularly\
        \ described by a correspondent of the Times, who said : \u2014 \" In the choir\
        \ of the Temple Neuf, divided from the nave, was lodged the espe cial glory\
        \ of Alsace \u2014 its Library, the finest on the Rhine, in which the archives,\
        \ antiquities, topo graphy, and early printing collections were trea sured.\
        \ All have perished. Since the apocryphal burning of the library of Alexandria,\
        \ perhaps no equally irreparable loss has occurred. The walls are standing\
        \ ; all else is a mass of ruins. In the entrance vestibule was a collection\
        \ of Gallo-Roman antiquities, altars, inscriptions, bas-reliefs, statuary\
        \ ; a few of these may be restored. A stone let into the wall, in which was\
        \ cut a head of Louis XIV., and a notice that it had been taken from the cachois\
        \ of the Bastille, had a portion destroyed. In the interior of the choir nothing\
        \ was visible but heaps of ruin and charred paper. I picked up some fragments\
        \ on which the old Aldine and early German types were still legible. In the\
        \ nave of the church the vaulted roofing had fallen to the ground in a huge\
        \ mountain of ruins. Everything had perished save the old monuments let into\
        \ the walls, that of Tauler, the mystic preacher, being the most interesting.\
        \ The utter destruction of this Library seemed to me so incredible that I\
        \ have yesterday and to-day repeatedly put the question, Was nothing saved\
        \ ? Not a single leaf ! There was a fatality about the Library. No catalogue\
        \ of its many treasures exists. An elaborate one in MS. had been prepared\
        \ by the librarian. It has perished ! M. Silbermann, publisher of the Cour\
        \ rier du Bas-Rhin, tells me that a whole library of MSS. of his grand work,\
        \ the 'Alsace Antiquary.' has perished, among them sixteen folio vols. of\
        \ MSS. upon Strasburg. The greatest loss of all is that of the most precious\
        \ record connected with the discovery of printing \u2014 the documents of\
        \ the legal process of Guttenberg against the heirs of his partner, Dreisehn,\
        \ to establish his right as the in ventor of typography.\" The Municipality\
        \ of Stras burg are blamed for allowing such a catastrophe to occur. They\
        \ had already had ten days' experience of the bombardment, and twenty-four\
        \ hours' notice of the commencement of the active siege had been and wine\
        \ could be had in abundance, but milk was unprocurable, and butter could not\
        \ be purchased under five francs the pound. I had not been many hours in Strasburg\
        \ before a change took place in all these respects. Carts laden with vegetables\
        \ entered the citv. Butter was again placed on the table. It was announced\
        \ that milk would be obtain able on the morrow.\" The writer lost no time\
        \ in visit ing all the points of interest, and of the cathedral he reported\
        \ that the spire had been injured in more places than one. The cross on its\
        \ summit leaned on one side; as if it had been struck by a projectile. Some\
        \ of the ornamental work had been carried away, and in one of the side towers\
        \ a portion of the stone stairs had been destroyed. The outer roof of the\
        \ nave was burned, and the windows here and there were broken with balls.\
        \ \" To this place the German soldiers hastened as soon as they got here.\
        \ They ascended the tower, they explored the interior. The officers were as\
        \ eager as the men not only to see the renowned cathe dral, but also to learn\
        \ the truth as to the damage clone to it. All with whom I conversed expressed\
        \ their satisfaction at the comparative unimportance of the injury inflicted.\

        \ cassock, his head encased in a bonnet de coton, surmounted by a rusty broad\
        \ ecclesiastical hat. I could not help it, but the image of Don Quixote, that\

    - ["Feb., 187 i.] MONARCHISTS AND REPUBLICANS. 273 publicans had the whole even\
        \ of Paris to them selves. The middle-classes were for the most part monarchical,\
        \ though, until cheered by the triumph of their views in the provinces, they\
        \ had not the courage to say so. By the middle of February they began to declare\
        \ themselves \u2014 some with timidity and caution, others more boldly. The\
        \ Paris correspondent of the Times asked a librarian who had expressed strong\
        \ monarchical opinions, and had openly condemned the Republic, how he could\
        \ venture to do so in Paris. His answer was that he had fought side by side\
        \ with the battalions of the National Guard from the Belleville quarter, and\
        \ had seen how ready they were to run away. \" They are arrant cowards,\"\
        \ he said, \" whom we know we can beat if it comes to fighting : they are\
        \ no longer the men of '92.\" The same corre spondent heard a discussion in\
        \ a political club to much the same effect. At this meeting, \"a speaker,\
        \ dwelling upon the political cowardice which made his countrymen go like\
        \ sheep in a direction they secretly detested, urged upon them the necessity\
        \ of greater courage in expressing their sentiments in their choice of a form\
        \ of Government. ' Are you a Monarchist or a Republican ?' shouted a man in\
        \ the audience. This was rather too sudden an application of his own preaching\
        \ to suit the speaker, who seemed embarrassed for a moment, and then said,\
        \ amid loud laughter, ' On this point I must be permitted to follow the example\
        \ of my audience, and remain silent' It was evident that he was a Monarchist,\
        \ and afraid as yet to say so ; but, finding the meeting by no means hostile\
        \ to reactionary views, he took advantage of their ap parent sympathy, and\
        \ went so far in denouncing the Republic that another man took courage, and\
        \ with some boldness denounced it as unfit for the country in its present\
        \ condition, illustrating his position by the character of the local elections,\
        \ and by the fact that political exile was a far stronger qualification in\
        \ the eyes of the Republican than any talent. He alluded with gratification\
        \ to the election of the Duke d'Aumale and Prince de Joinville, and denied\
        \ that Paris could be considered in any way to represent even the large towns\
        \ of France.\" The existence of this feeling was doubt less much more general\
        \ than might have been sup posed. The Republic is always established in Paris\
        \ by a surprise ; and the return of so many extreme politicians in the recent\
        \ elections was rather to be attributed to the defective organisation of the\
        \ moderate party, and to civic cowardice, than to the existence of an actual\
        \ majority in favour of the Red Republic. much of its wonted aspect. The first\
        \ appearance of sullen gloom and smouldering anger dis appeared with the arrival\
        \ of food from the pro vinces and abroad, and in a little while something\
        \ of the old gaiety, self-esteem, and confidence re turned. People said that\
        \ after all Paris had not been conquered by the Prussians; it had only been\
        \ vanquished by hunger : a statement not without a certain degree of truth,\
        \ though subject to the im portant qualification that it was the Prussians\
        \ who produced the hunger. France was going to pre pare herself for a renewal\
        \ of the fight at no distant day, and in a few years' time her soldiers would\
        \ be in Berlin. For the present, there was life to be enjoyed, and the future\
        \ must take care of itself. It is true that a large proportion of the Parisian\
        \ populace was in mourning, and that hardly a woman was to be seen who did\
        \ not wear black. But the theatres were again open and well-attended ; and\
        \ the old animation returned to the streets ; and Paris once more danced and\
        \ gesticulated as of yore, and tried to believe herself the queen and oracle\
        \ of the world. The men were never tired of admiring their own heroism, and\
        \ the women swore they would educate their children in the religion of undying\
        \ hatred of Prussia, to take effect as soon as the Republic had regenerated\
        \ the nation, and trained society to a practical faith in the brother- hood\
        \ of peoples. It was under this condition of things as regards the metropolis\
        \ that M. Thiers entered on the task of government at Bordeaux. On Sunday,\
        \ the 19th of February, the newly-appointed head of the Executive read a speech\
        \ in the Assembly, stating that, although he felt frightened at the painful\
        \ duty imposed on him, he nevertheless accepted it with obedience, devotion,\
        \ and love \u2014 sentiments of which France stood all the more in need as\
        \ she was now more unfortunate than at any other period of her history. The\
        \ country, however, was still great, young, rich, and full of resources, and\
        \ would always remain a lasting monument of human energy. M. Thiers then announced\
        \ that he had formed his Administration, and that, in selecting its members,\
        \ he had been guided solely by the public esteem they enjoyed, and their character\
        \ and capacities. The list was as follows : \u2014 M. Dufaure Minister of\
        \ Justice. M . Jules Favre Foreign Affairs. M. Picard Interior. M. Jules Simon\
        \ Public Instruction. M. Lambrecht Commerce. General Le F16 War. Admiral Pothuan\

        by an entertain ment at the Guildhall, given to all those members of the House
        of Commons who had voted for the third reading of the Bill, as Avell as to
        those peers Avho had voted against Lord Lyndhurst''s amendment, and such other
        noblemen and gentlemen as had lent their aid to the cause. In acknoAA''ledging
        the honour conferred upon him Earl Grey paid befitting tribute to the City''s
        influence in the commercial Avorld, its loyalty to the constitution, and its
        love of freedom "never more conspicuously manifested " than during recent
        eA-ents.1 A book containing the autographs of the principal guests, among
        whom was the Duke of Sussex, is pre served in the Guildhall library, as Avell
        as a medal struck in commemoration of the passing of the Bill.2 With this
        signal triumph of the people, to which the city of London had contributed
        so much, the present Avork is brought to a close. No good end Avould be serA''ed
        by entering the domain of contemporary poli tics. Enough has been set out
        in these pages to convince the impartial reader that the city of London is
        no mean city ; that it possesses a record equal, if not indeed superior, to
        that of any other city in the Universe, ancient or modern, and that its Avealth
        and influence have eA''er been devoted to the cause of religious, social and
        political freedom. Not\A''ithstanding anything its detractors may say, the
        City has not only marched Avith the age, it has for the most part been a leader
        of public opinion, and has shown itself in adA''ance of the ''Journal 106,

        later history of the Birmingham Library is somewhat uneventful. The building

        front elevation. About the year r86o, the Library had fallen into a languishing
        condition, but after the absorption of the New Library in that year a new
        era of prosperity set in, and at the present time it is reckoned among the
        most important proprietory libraries in the kingdom. It now contains upwards
        of fifty thousand volumes, selected from the literature of most countries,
        and including a large proportion of old and valuable works not supplied by
        ordinary circulating libraries, such as county histories, the Transactions
        of the Royal Society, the Linnean Society, and others ; illustrated, scarce,
        and rare works. The Dissenters who had been outvoted on the question of providing
        controversial theology, found further cause for dissatisfaction with the management
        of the Library, in the dissensions which took place at the annual meeting
        in 1793, and soon afterwards many of them seceded, and formed a rival institution
        known as the Birmingham New Library, the first home of which was in Cannon
        Street. As in the case of the parent institution, a suitable building was
        subsequently erected, on the tontine plan, in Temple Row West, and the New
        Library had a prosperous career for upwards of sixty years. The rules drawn
        up by Dr. Priestley for the Old Library, were, with a few alterations, adopted
        by the newer establishment. Two new rules were, however, adopted, which were
        somewhat curious. One was that the committee should be selected by lot, and
        for this purpose "the names of all the subscribers, written on separate cards
        of the same size and form, should be put into a box, indiscriminately, out
        of which some person appointed by the President shall, in the presence of
        the general meeting, draw forty names, which the President shall write down
        in the order in which they were drawn ; of these forty the twenty first drawn
        names shall form the committee." The other provided " that should the committee
        twice reject or postpone any book recommended by a subscriber, it shall be
        lawful for any five members to put up in the Library Room a requisition to
        the Librarian to order the said book which shall have been so rejected. As
        soon as this requisition shall be signed by one-tenth of the whole number
        of subscribers (and in no case shall it be necessary to have more than twenty
        names), the Librarian shall instantly order the book into the library, provided
        that the expenses on this account do not annually exceed one-tenth of the
        sum expended each year in the purchase of books." The Birmingham New Library
        continued to exist until 1860, when it The period of intellectual activity
        which gave birth to the Birmingham Library is further exemplified in the great
        number of publications which teemed forth from the local press during the
        last quarter of the eighteenth century. First among these, mention should
        be made of our first local history, the publication of which merits more than
        a passing notice. It has always been a marked characteristic of Birmingham''s
        adopted sons that they have entertained a greater affection for the town,
        if possible, than even her own sons, and William Hutton never strove to hide
        the love and admiration he felt for the town of his adoption, and from an
        early period he became ambitious to write its history. He began to make preparations
        for this undertaking some time before 1775, but circumstances of a private
        nature engaging his attention for several years, he relinquished the design,
        and destroyed the materials he had collected for that purpose. Happily, however,
        the old ambition was rekindled, and about 1 780 he once more set about the
        work. His daughter, Catherine Hutton, writing to a friend on Christmas Day,
        1780, said: " My father''s History of Birmingham is just as you left it. I
        believe he means to publish it, but I do not know when." But its author was
        diffident.', 2]
    - ["THE REFERENCE LIBRARY RESTORED. 501 carefully and judiciously selected library.\
        \ The inaugural address at the reopening of the Library was delivered in the\
        \ Town Hall by the Right Hon. John Bright. From that time to the present the\
        \ work of completing the library has been zealously carried on ; under the\
        \ fostering care of the chief librarian, Mr. J. D. Mullins, the various features\
        \ of the old Reference Library have been restored in the new collection. The\
        \ Shakespeare Memorial Library, which is housed in a separate room designed\
        \ to accord with its priceless possessions, now numbers 9,274 volumes, comprising\
        \ editions and translations of the works of Shakespeare, as well as editions\
        \ of the separate plays and poems in various languages (including the famous\
        \ first folio edition, as well as the four succeeding issues in the folio\
        \ form), also a large mass of illustrative matter, biographical and critical,\
        \ antiquarian and topo graphical, together with the works of Shakespeare's\
        \ contemporaries and works on the history of the drama and the stage. A new\
        \ Cervantes collection has also been formed, and by the kindness of several\
        \ donors collections of a similar character have been obtained of the works\
        \ of Byron and Milton, and of the ana which has grown up around the works\
        \ of these writers. While the Staunton collection itself was to a large extent\
        \ irreplaceable, a new Warwickshire collection has been formed, which is rich\
        \ in important MSS., docu ments, drawings, scarce prints, etc., and happily\
        \ among these is included one of the rarest items of the lost Staunton collection,\
        \ the Register of the Gild of St. Anne of Knowle, an illuminated manuscript\
        \ record extending from 1407 to 1535, consisting of 239 leaves, on vellum.\
        \ The description which Elihu Burritt gave of the Reference Library in t868\
        \ is in a larger sense true of the restored library, and of the home in which\
        \ it is housed : \" The Reference Library,\" he said, \" is truly a vast treasure\
        \ house of every department of human learning; and, to use an American simile\
        \ of hospitality, 'you will always find the latch-string outside the door.'\
        \ The lofty hall represents the sphere of knowledge it embraces. The philosopher,\
        \ the historian, theologian, lawyer, inventor, and scientific mechanic may\
        \ each find here an almost boundless mine from which he may draw, as cheaply\
        \ as water, the most valuable deposits of thought, observation, and fact.\
        \ Here a poor but earnest learner may explore a volume which cost more than\
        \ a small farm in Illinois, and transfer the whole harvest of its wisdom into\
        \ his own stock of knowledge.\" Although it would be invidious to single out\
        \ for special mention the names of individual donors, there is one name which\
        \ cannot be passed over in silence in any record of the foundation of the\
        \ Reference Library \u2014 that of Mr. Sam : Timmins, who worked enthusiastically\
        \ in the movement for the adoption of the Free Libraries Act, and ever since\
        \ the establish ment of the Free Libiaries has, by his munificent donations\
        \ and his abiding interest in the growth of the Reference Library, earned\
        \ a prominent place in the roll of founders of the Library. In recognition\
        \ of his gifts and labours a life-like bust of Mr. Timmins, by F. Williams,\
        \ has been accorded a place of honour in the Reference Library. A similar\
        \ bust, by the same sculptor, occupied the same position in the Reference\
        \ Library before the fire, and perished with the grand collection which Mr.\
        \ Timmins had largely helped to bring together. It was rightly felt that the\
        \ Reference Library could not be regarded as completely restored until the\
        \ counterfeit presentment of the good genius of the Library once more occupied\
        \ its old position ; accordingly a new bust was executed by the same hand,\
        \ and has been set up in the Library. The great catalogue which Mr. Mullins\
        \ and his staff have compiled is worthy of special mention. The first portion\
        \ was issued in 1883, and the work was completed in 1890; it contains 1,284\
        \ Pages, and comprises something like seventy thousand entries, with a summary\
        \ of the contents of the various collections of a miscellaneous character,\
        \ a very full bibliography of Birmingham books and pamphlets, and of works\
        \ on Bibliography, with special indices. It is in fact a monument of patient\
        \ industry, and forms, as has been well said, the keystone of the arch which\
        \ is represented by the circle of knowledge contained in this noble Library.\
        \ Two other memorials also find a place in the restored building ; the one\
        \ is the first statue of George Dawson, by T. Woolner, R.A., which formerly\
        \ occupied the site under the canopy in front of the Art Gallery ; the second\
        \ is a bust of William Hamper, in the Reference", 1]

        \ that the necessary number of subscribers had been obtained by the beginning\
        \ of the year 1793, as a meeting was held at the Shakes peare Tavern, (the\
        \ front partion of the New Street Theatre building,) on the 7th of January\
        \ in that year, \" in order to take into consideration, and adopt proper measures\
        \ for carrying the same into effect.\" The most suitable site for the proposed\
        \ building appeared to be on what had formerly been known as \" Corbett's\
        \ Bowling Green \" ; and so this pleasant oasis in the very heart of the town\
        \ was doomed to extinction. The land then belonged to Dr. William Withering,\
        \ and adjoined his house; and here, at a cost of less than a thousand pounds,\
        \ the permanent home of the Birmingham Library was erected, the site being\
        \ obtained on a lease of 120 years, dating from June 24th, 1793, at a ground\
        \ rent of J,\\\\ 15s. per annum. Only a portion of the Library building as\
        \ we now know it was at first erected, the whole frontage comprising originally\
        \ only the portion of which the portico is the centre, with one window on\
        \ each side the entrance. The architect was Mr. William Hollins, and the facade\
        \ was designed in the prevailing classic style, the lower portion of the portico\
        \ being supported by Doric columns, while those flanking the upper portion\
        \ were of the Ionic order. The entrance was graced with a I^atin inscrip tion\
        \ from the pen of Dr. Samuel Parr, as follows : From this time the new institution\
        \ grew and prospered. In December, 1782, it contained only about five hundred\
        \ volumes, but by 1786 its stock had increased to sixteen hundred volumes,\
        \ and in that year the librarian, Mr. William Home, ' in conse quence of an\
        \ advance in salary,' attended to the business of the Library an additional\
        \ hour in the day, viz., from ten to eleven o'clock in the day. A paper warfare\
        \ disturbed the harmony of the committee in T785-r786, on the question of\
        \ the introduction of controversial theology into the Library, to which Dr.\
        \ Priestley and his friends were bitterly opposed, and ultimately (at a meeting\
        \ held December 12th, 1787), a resolution was passed in favour of admitting\
        \ works of this character, by a majority of ninety-one against fifty-three.\
        \ As a result of this decision, Dr. Priestley, \"the father of the Library,\"\
        \ as he has been called, left the committee, although he continued as a subscriber\
        \ for several years. As the Library continued to grow and prosper, a new and\
        \ larger room was needed for its accommoda tion, and in 1790 it was removed\
        \ to premises formerly used as a Repository, in the Upper Priory. In the same\
        \ year the Medical Library, (the nucleus of the splendid library of the present\
        \ Medical Institute), was formed, and was deposited in the Birmingham Library,\
        \ and for many years remained accessible to the subscribers of the latter\
        \ institution. The com mittee, however, had not regarded the removal to the\
        \ Priory as anything more than a temporary measure, for in 1789 a scheme had\
        \ been proposed for erecting a permanent Library building on the then popular\
        \ Tontine system, as will be seen from the following announcement : \u2014\
        \ \"Ad mercaturam bonarum artium profectus et tibi et omnibus ditesces.\"\
        \ which has been translated : \" Resorting to the Mart of the Sciences, you\
        \ will grow rich, both for yourself and others.* The building, thus completed,\
        \ was conveyed by indenture dated 25th March, 1798, to the persons nominated\
        \ by the Tontine subscribers. Of these there were 181 persons entered as proprietors\
        \ of the \"Birmingham Library.\u2014 A Subscription is open in the Library\

    - ["PREFACE. In attempting to re-tell the story of the Making of Birmingham, I\
        \ have endeavoured to profit by the criticisms on my former work, to give\
        \ directness and continuity, as far as possible, to the narrative, and to\
        \ carry on the history of the town to the present time. During the fifteen\
        \ years which have elapsed since the completion of the former work I have\
        \ devoted my leisure hours to further research in the fascinating subject\
        \ of the early history of our town, in which I have had the pleasure and advantage\
        \ of being allied with some of the most devoted students of local arch\xE6\
        ology. From the materials accumulated during this period I trust I have been\
        \ able to present a fuller picture of the life and growth of the town ; while\
        \ the experience of the past has prevented undue proportion being given to\
        \ some less important phases of old Birmingham life. I cannot bring my work\
        \ to a close without acknowledging the valuable help I have received from\
        \ many quarters. To Mr. Sam : Timmins, F.S.A., I owe a deep debt of gratitude\
        \ for the encourage ment I have received from him during the progress of the\
        \ work, for kindly criticism and assistance, and for the loan of valuable\
        \ prints and drawings. To Mr. Joseph Hill, too, I am indebted for similar\
        \ help and encouragement. The readiness with which the authors of various\
        \ works on certain aspects of local history, biographies of local worthies,\
        \ etc., have permitted me to make use of their books, and to reproduce engravings\
        \ therefrom, calls for special acknowledgment. To Mr. J. Thackray Bunce, J.\
        \ A. Langford, LL.D., Dr. S. Smiles, and others, I would express my gratitude\
        \ for help in this direction. To collectors and owners of books, prints, and\
        \ drawings, who have willingly lent me of their store, and allowed me to reproduce\
        \ unique drawings and valuable prints, I also owe a debt of gratitude, and\
        \ would here acknowledge the kind permission accorded to me by Sir J. B. Stone\
        \ to reproduce a rare view of Old Vauxhall in his possession, and the kindness\
        \ of Miss K. E. Bunce and Mr. C. M. Gere in allowing me to reproduce their\
        \ picture panels illustrative of Birmingham history. Mr. Alfred Osborne and\
        \ Mr. E. H. New have freely placed at my disposal original drawings of Birmingham\
        \ places, and to them also I would tender my sincere thanks. To Mr. J. D.\
        \ Mullins, Chief Librarian of the Birmingham Free Libraries, Mr. C. E. Scarse,\
        \ of the Birmingham Old Library, and the Arch\xE6ological Section of the Midland\
        \ Institute, my thanks are also due for the kindness with which they have\
        \ allowed me to make use of the valuable collections of Birmingham books,\
        \ etc., under their care. I should not omit also to thank Mr. W. C. Sullivan,\
        \ editor of the Birmingham Daily Mail, for the permission accorded to me to\
        \ reprint portions of a series of articles on the history of the Birmingham\

        \ manner in which the publisher, Mr. j. L. Allday, has entered into this project,\
        \ sparing no expense in the copious illustration of the narrative, should\
        \ not pass unrecorded. He has, throughout the progress of the work, I believe,\

        \ as a commercial undertaking. Both from himself and his staff I have met\
        \ with unvarying kindness and consideration, and should be wanting in gratitude\

        went forth to astonish all the librarians of Europe," we shall have more to
        say in future chapters. previous chapter. Beyond Steelhouse Lane we notice
        Weaman Street and Slaney Street, and at the top and bottom of Snow Hill are
        marked the two Weighing Machines which the inhabitants owed to the inventive
        genius of Wyatt. A '' Methodist Meeting'' is marked on the plan as lying at
        the back of Steelhouse Lane, but this vvas probably nothing more imposing
        than a cottage which had been placed at the service of the followers of Wesley
        by its owner. The name '' Walmer Lane,'' which appears on the plan, at the
        bottom of Steelhouse Lane, shows that the sponsors of the new recreation ground
        have old usage to plead for the corruption of ''Wallmote'' into ''Walmer,''
        in the name given to the new ground. It occurs frequently, indeed, in this
        form, in the early issues of the Gazette, and sometimes further corrupted
        into " Womber Lane," the name by which it is still popularly known in that
        neighbourhood. Returning along New Street, the upper portion of which we must
        yet know only as "Swinford Street," according to Bradford''s plan, we come
        to Temple Street, noticing, as we pass, the former cherry-orchard, at this
        time known as "Collett''s Gardens," on the south side of New Street. On its
        western side, Temple Street was bordered by a row of trees, and from the bottom
        of Temple Street to the Free Grammar School, New Street had a similar row
        of trees on its northern side. But before reaching the last-named point we
        notice several new street names on Bradford''s plan ; here is indeed quite
        a new colony of houses, and the names of Peck Lane, King Street, Colmore Street
        and the Froggary, are as unfamilar to us to-day as they were a few years previous
        to the date of our survey. Peck Lane ran from New Street a little below the
        present Stephenson Place, down to the lower end of Pinfold Street, at the
        junction ofthe latter with Dudley Street, and near this point stood the Old
        Gaol, or Dungeon, depicted in our illustration on page 75. Peck Lane was intersected
        by King Street and Colmore Street, the two forming one thoroughfare from Worcester
        Street to the lower end of Collett''s Gardens. The Froggary formed an elbow,
        one arm of which ran into Colmore Street, and the other into Peck Lane. A
        narrow passage ran out of King Street into New Street, called Queen''s Alley.
        Cannon Street, too, is a name not met with on previous plans, having been
        cut across the old Cherry Orchard about the time the Baptist Meeting-house
        (called on Brad- ford''s plan the "Independent Meeting") was built. On the
        east side of Stafford Street several new streets are shown as having been
        laid out, and the land marked "for building." and the name of "Aston Street
        " now appears, although up to this date only a few houses had been built along
        it. East of Coleshill Street, too, new streets had grown up around St. Bartholomew''s
        Chapel ; there is '' Chappel Street '' and ''Chappel Row,'' ''St. Bartholomew''s
        Street'' and '' Jennens Row,'' all evidently deriving their names from the
        chapel and its principal benefactors. In Moor Street, or lying about half-way
        between that thoroughfare and Park Street, the '' Play House '' is marked,
        the only one of the three then existing which was deemed worthy of mention
        on the plan ; and beyond the last-named street we come to the open fields
        and gardens, and find that we have completed our survey ofBirmingham in 1750.
        The new portion of the town, lying beyond Bull Street, had grown up with equal
        rapidity. Here, too, we notice new names and new buildings. " Westley Street,"
        a continuation of the "Lower Minories" to John Street, must be the "London
        ''Prentice Street :'' of later years, but "John Street" and "Thomas Street
        " and " Litchfield Street " we have only recently got rid of by the creation
        of the new thoroughfares on thelmprovementSchemearea. TheWorkhouseappears
        on Bradford''s plan, with the two wings, but these were not added until a
        later date, as we have seen in a Samuel Bradford seems also to have projected
        the publication of a View of the Town as a companion to his Plan, in 1753,
        and indeed the late Mr. Toulmin Smith had in his possession an impression
        of this view which he described as " a remarkable and very fine engraving,
        more than five feet in length;" but it would seem that this was only a proof
        copy, and that the engraving vvas never published, for those best acquainted
        with illustrations of Birmingham know of', 1]
    - ['168 THE MAKING OF BIRMINGHAM. in connection with the sphere of his academic
        duties began to attract attention. He became acquainted with Benjamin Franklin,
        and at his suggestion under took to write a History of Electric Science. He
        married the daughter of a wealthy ironmaster while at Warrington, and in 1767
        accepted an invitation to become pastor of the Mill Hill Chapel, Leeds. While
        there he "commenced that brilliant series of discoveries by which other hands
        and other brains than his accomplished the destruction of one of the biggest
        stumbling blocks to human knowledge of which history has any record."* During
        his stay at Leeds a curious incident occurred. A scientific expedition was
        being organized by Sir Joseph Banks to accompany Captain 1780, in which year
        the New Meeting congregation, which were then without a pastor, owing to the
        retire ment of the Rev. William Hawkes, "judiciously turned their thoughts
        towards the celebrated Doctor Priestley, F.R.S., one of the first philosophers
        of the age, whose merit seems obvious to every eye but his own."* The daughter
        of the historian whose words we have just quoted, writing to a friend on Christmas
        day in the above-named year, mentioned the appointment of the great philosopher
        and scholar, which gave great satisfaction to all the more liberal-minded
        inhabitants. She says : " The celebrated Dr. Priestley has taken up his residence
        among us for the sake of facilitating his philosophical experiments, and Mr.
        Hawkes, one JOSEPH PRIESTLEY, LL.D, Cook on his second voyage to the South
        Seas, and Priestley was invited by Sir Joseph Banks to join the expedition
        as an astronomer, and accepted the invitation. Shortly afterwards, however,
        he was informed that his appointment was cancelled, as the Board of Longitude
        objected to his theology ! of the preachers at the New Meeting, having resigned
        his place, it has been offered to the Doctor, and it is generally believed
        he will accept it. If he do so, you may expect to hear of my becoming a convert
        to his religion, for I am very weary of Calvinistic monotony and nonsense."!
        In 1773 Priestley was recommended by Dr. Price to Lord Shelburne, for the
        post of librarian and literary companion to his lordship, and obtained the
        appointment at a salary of a year, with a house. He remained in the employ
        of Lord Shelburne until Dr. Priestley remained at the New Meeting until the
        lamentable riots of 1791, which were doubtless, to some extent brought about
        by his zealous advocacy of liberal opinions, both in religion and politics.

        \ the town. Nothing is known of the exact place at which it originated, as\
        \ the earliest records of the library are lost, the earliest existing notice\
        \ of the new institution being in the Gazelle of June 12th, 1780, wherein\
        \ is announced a general meeting of the subscribers, to be held on the following\

        \ standard of public life, in which it was realised that one of the greatest\
        \ benefits which could be conferred upon the community would be the establishment\
        \ of a public library. \"While its intellectual activity was so eager and\
        \ intense, Birming ham felt the spirit of the coming time, and in this season\

        \ of a Library, the means both of learning wisdom from the past by its guidance,\
        \ and of receiving the inspira tion of human genius to strengthen it to meet\
        \ the coming days.\"* During 1780, as we have seen, Dr. Priestley settled\
        \ in Birmingham, and having had experience of a similar library at Leeds,\
        \ he was enabled to contribute largely, by his advice and assistance, to the\
        \ success of the new enterprise. \" He not only wrote the various advertise\
        \ ments which appeared,\" says Mr. Timmins, \"but he drew up a code of laws\
        \ on the principle adopted at Leeds, and the best testimony to their merit\
        \ is that they have been substantially without important changes for a hundred\
        \ years.\" One of the earliest statements as to the position of the library\
        \ and the aims of its projectors appeared in the Gazette of June nth, 1781,\
        \ as follows : The beginning of the new Library was on a very humble scale.\
        \ There were only nineteen subscribers, and Hutton tell us, \" their whole\
        \ stock [of books] might have been laid in a handkerchief.\" There had been\
        \ private subscription libraries before this, and, as we have seen, a book-club\
        \ also. Hutton's first step after settling in Birmingham had been to open\
        \ a small circulating library, and Mr. Timmins tells us, in his interesting\
        \ pamphlet on the history of the Birmingham Library,! that there was a still\
        \ more important private library, \"that of John \"Birmingham Library.\u2014\
        \ A general meeting of the sub scribers to this institution is appointed to\
        \ be held on Wednesday, the 13th of June, at the Castle Inn, in High Street,\
        \ at three o'clock in the afternoon, when every subscriber is desired to attend,\
        \ to consider of some laws relative to the government of the society. This\
        \ Library is formed upon the plan of one that was first established at Liverpool,\

        \ exhibition of such stones in a public museum would have been a matter for\

        \ was a stone of the L'Aigle fall, presented in 1804 by Biot, the distinguished\

        contrast with the greater attractions in some respects of urban populations.
        I venture to say that no amount of legislative change can ameliorate the condition
        of the inhabitants of our rural districts unless it be ac companied by a transformation
        of character. It is moral worth, and not political franchises, that will raise
        our rural population. Where we have high moral character, intelligence, industry,
        self-denial, and public spirit, there is nothing in our political institutions
        which forbids village life to be as happy in all its true essentials as that
        of the mightiest city in our land. Trusting that the facts recorded in this
        volume, and the principles laid down, may help to this end is the Author''s
        fervent prayer. I will not close this short preface without expressing more
        formally and precisely than I have been able to do in the body of the work
        my great obligations to many friends and helpers. Notably to Mr. H. Chetwynd-Stapylton,

        \ for two years with Madame Prenat, and that I did not know what he intended\
        \ to do at the end of that time. This always silenced my grandfather. But\

        \ send the regiment to India at a time when considerable arrears of pay were\
        \ due, the soldiers took counsel among themselves in regard to their present\

        \ the whole body shouldered their arms and marched off at quick step to Arthur's\
        \ Seat, and fixed their quarters near its summit. Their officers, in the first\
        \ instance, tried to soothe them with fair promises, but to these the men\
        \ turned a deaf ear, having afready -experienced their worthlessness. Threats\
        \ then resorted to being equally unavailing, as the Highlanders knew they\
        \ were so situated as to place infantry at defiance, and that, from the nature\
        \ of the ground, cavalry would be equally ineffective, the only resource was\
        \ an accom modation through the intervention of some one in whom the Highlanders\
        \ would place confidence. This was at last effected through Lords Macdonald\
        \ and Dunmore, on whose honour the men had great reliance, and the differences\
        \ being satisfactorily arranged, the regiment returned to its aUegiance, and\
        \ shortly after embarked for foreign service. In the end of last century the\

        \ on the E by an old battery called the Spur, which was demolished about 1649.\
        \ After the removal of this, a narrow raised roadway was formed across the\

        \ earth removed from the site of the Royal Exchange during the building opera\
        \ tions there after 1753. Further improvements were made in 1816-20. The 1450\
        \ line of defence round the city passed across the top of the Castle Hill\
        \ at the E end of the Esplanade, and was there pierced by a gateway called\
        \ the Barrier Gate, which was temporarily restored when George IV. visited\

        \ purpose of isolating the garrison during the cholera epidemic then prevalent\

        \ as we have seen, the fortifica tions rose again from the ruins in the brief\
        \ period of power of Edward III., who erected, after the fashion of his time,\
        \ a strong curtain wall with towers; and shortly afterwards David II. , when\

        \ the 29th of August, \u2022occasioning great excitement in the city, and\
        \ drawing to it many visitors from all parts of the country. Two years later\
        \ two great fires broke out in the Old Town in June and November, and caused\
        \ serious damage, one of them, which lasted three days, destroying the greater\

        \ for the city under the new bill in 1832. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert\
        \ visited the city in 1842, and were everywhere received with enthusiasm,\

        partisan use of the offices, as a means of rewarding those who have worked
        for the election of the appointer and of punishment for those who have not,
        was earlier developed in New York and Pennsylvania than elsewhere, largely
        because of the existence in those States of a large body of apathetic non-English
        voters. In New York the ill-devised council of appointment had much to do
        with the growth of the system, and so had Aaron Burr. In the Federal Government,
        Jefferson car ried out the system to a considerable extent. The Act of 1820
        prescribing a four-years'' term for many officers favored its growth. Finally,
        the politi cians who surrounded Jackson brought it to its full development
        as an engine of party warfare. It has since been a regular reature of American
        politics in every administration, tempered of late by the provisions of the
        Civil Ser vice Act of 1883. The phrase was derived from a statement of Senator
        W. L. Marcy, of New York, in a speech in the Senate in 1832. Speaking of the
        New York politicians, he said: " They see nothing wrong in the rule that to

        cut off Lee''s communications with Richmond, and with this intention he hurried
        forward toward Spottsylvania Court House. Lee hastened in the same direction
        and, by obstructing the Federal route with felled trees and skirmishers, managed
        to arrive first, Warren''s advance corps of Grant''s army being detained on
        the road. On May 7, 1864, there was some slight skirmishing. May 8, Grant
        sent Sheridan''s cavalry corps to ride around the Confederate army, tearing

        call handsome, on looking at his face a second time there was something that
        I did not like about it, and he had an austere, haughty, and somewhat deceitful
        expression. His companion was a young girl, who looked from eighteen to twenty
        years of age. She was tall and rather stout, and her hair, which was of a
        light brown colour, was coiled up on the top of her head, and partially covered

        someone. These thoughts had hardly passed through my mind when the gentleman

        \ year, aged 41 years, and was buried two days afterwards at Chelford (Earwaker's\
        \ East Cheshire, ii., 869). For his second wife he married at Preston, 7th\
        \ April, 1812, a Miss Fenton, cf that town. By his first wife he had two sons:\
        \ (1) Edmund Henry Penny, M.A., of Brasenose College, Oxford, assistant master\
        \ and librarian of Charterhouse, and Eector of Great Stambridge, in Essex,\
        \ from 1839 to 1879 ; (2) Henry Penny, educated at Man chester School, died\

        \ Edmund Wilkinson, a native of Penrith district, was, on Nov. 28th, 1816,\
        \ instituted to Chipping Vicarage, on collation of George Henry Law, Bishop\
        \ of Chester (Instit. Books, Series C, vol. i.) ; on which day his testimonial\
        \ was signed by Eobert Parkinson, minister of Longridge ; Hugh Hodgson, minister\
        \ of Broughton ; and John Harrison, curate of Grimsargh, who stated that he\
        \ was then assistant curate of Whitechapel, and had been personally known\
        \ to them for 2 years and 10 months From 1817 to 1837 he acted as master of\
        \ Brabin's School ; and it was through his exertions that the school was enlarged\
        \ in 1 840. He died at Chipping on September 23rd, 1864, at the advanced age\
        \ of 81, and was buried at the east end of the churchyard. His wife predeceased\
        \ him, dying 10th March, 1863, aged 82. Over their remains is a headstone,\
        \ with an inscription. Within the church, a marble tablet and an inscribed\
        \ brass fittingly record the virtues of this worthy vicar (see pages71-2).\
        \ Mr. Wilkinson married at Goosnargh, May 11, 1818, Alice Baines, of Goosnargh,\
        \ but had no issue. A little more than a year later his brother, Eichard Wilkinson,\

        \ Clifton, of Goosnargh, but survived only four years, and was buried at Whitechapel\
        \ March 2 1st, 1823, at the early age of 32. His sister, Alice, married Mr.\

        \ the same time the degree of D.D. at Oxford, and honorary LL.D. at Cambridge.\
        \ Having been consecrated Bishop of Chester, he was in 1889 translated to\
        \ the See of Oxford. As a writer and interpreter of facts appertaining to\
        \ the history of this country Bishop Stubbs has few equals. The scholarship\
        \ and research displayed in his well-known Constitutional History of England\
        \ led Professor Freeman to remark that the author was \" the most life-like\
        \ portrait-painter of English kings, and the most profound expounder of the\
        \ English constitution.\" From 1862 \u2014 7 Professor Stubbs was librarian\
        \ and keeper of the manuscripts of the Archiepiscopal Library at Lambeth Palace,\
        \ an office to which he had been appointed by the late Archbishop of Canterbury.*\
        \ Another good and familiar name, whom I cannot allow to pass unnoticed, is\
        \ that of Dr. William Kaye, who died in 1892. He was a native of Knaresborough,\
        \ and was educated first by Mr. Cockett at the Grammar School, along with\
        \ Bishop Stubbs. The late Bishop of Manchester, Dr. Fraser, and he were scholars\
        \ of Line. Coll., Oxford, took their degrees together, the former being a\
        \ 1st class, and Ireland scholar ; the latter, Dr. Kaye, (only 19), a 1st\
        \ and 2nd, and Hebrew scholar. He was the professor of the Septuagint, the\
        \ head of Bishop's College, Calcutta, and afterwards retired to the Rectory\
        \ of Great Leighs in Essex. His scholarship, linguistic attainments, and natural\
        \ abilities commanded the admiration of Sir Henry Mayne, who being asked by\
        \ his brother whom he considered to be the most remarkable man he had met\
        \ with in India, replied Dr. Kaye. Dr. Burgon, Dean of Chichester, gives a\
        \ sketch of him in his work, Twelve Good Men and True, and regrets that he\
        \ cannoo do justice to one of such rare mental powers and devoted Christian\
        \ life.t The old feudal greatness of Knaresborough and the importance that\
        \ belonged to its royal castle have given way to a new order of things. From\
        \ the time of Queen Mary until the passing of the Reform Bill in 1867 the\
        \ town had always sent two members to Parliament. It was then reduced to one,\
        \ and eventually in 1885, when the Redistribution of Seats Act was passed,\
        \ its separate representation was lost, and it became part of the parliamentary\
        \ division of Ripon. The constituency was much enlarged by the provisions\
        \ of the Reform Act of 1832. For a period of thirty years before that time\

        \ to England, and in the following year we find something of its effects at\
        \ Knaresborough, for in 1833 there are 227 burials recorded in the registers,\
        \ or about forty per cent, above the average. Fourteen years afterwards the\
        \ town was again visited by the cholera, and the number of interments, which\
        \ in 1846 were 164, rose in 1847 to 223, in 1848 to 225, in 1849 they were\
        \ 226, and in the next year (1850) they fell to the normal number, about 150.\
        \ The consequences of this last calamity are well remembered by many persons\
        \ now living in the neighbourhood, but it is needless to dwell on them. A\
        \ portion of the church-yard was appropriated to the burial of the plague\
        \ stricken. The Knaresborough registers contain numerous entries of the old\
        \ local family of Benson, from whom was descended the first Baron Bingley.\
        \ A pedigree of the posterity of Robert Benson of Knaresborough, who died\
        \ in 1528, shewing the lineage of the said Lord Bingley, who was M.P. for\
        \ York, Chancellor of the Exchequer, &c, and who died in 1730, is given in\
        \ the Yorkshire County Magazine (1893), pages 35 \u2014 37. Of the family\
        \ and connections of Dr. Edward White Benson, the present Archbishop of Canterbury,\
        \ I shall furnish an extended account in that part of the work relating to\
        \ Pateley Bridge, where the Archbishop's ancestors were settled more than\
        \ a century ago. In the church-yard will be found many rhyming epitaphs, the\
        \ utility of which however, would seem doubtful, to judge from an admonitory\
        \ epigram contained on one of them : \" Praises on tombstones are trifles\
        \ vainly spent, A man's own name is his best monument.\" Near the porch, and\
        \ close beside the railings on the north-west side, is the tomb-stone of Ely\
        \ Hargrove, the historian of Knaresborough, and \" one whose indefatigable\
        \ literary pursuits were not more exemplary than his faithful and honourable\
        \ discharge of all the relative duties of domestic and of social life.\" He\
        \ died December 5th, 1818, in the 78th year of his age, and lies interred\

        \ at South Kensington and Finsbury, on the same plan as the Science and Art\
        \ Department examinations. The sum of \xA3\"14,702 has been expended on this\
        \ work by the Corporation. The history of the City Library is one of the most\
        \ interesting in our City annals. It is the subject of a monograph of sixty-eight\
        \ pages by the present Librarian, a work from which I take most of these few\
        \ notes about it. Such a Library existed in 1425 (temp. Henry VI), for there\
        \ is a grant of \"the New House or Library\" that year to the executors of\
        \ Richard Whittington and Wm. Bury, to be in their custody, and one of these\
        \ executors, John Carpenter, some of whose other good deeds have already been\
        \ mentioned, worthily fulfilled his trust, and bequeathed valuable books of\
        \ his own. All went well with the Library, and there are pleasant notes about\
        \ it from time to time which Mr. Welch has gathered together, until the evil\
        \ days of Protector Somerset. That rapacious scoundrel sent to \"borrow\"\
        \ the books, promising to return them shortly, and they w_ere carried away\
        \ in three \"carriers\" and never returned.* The Corporation were negotiating\
        \ with him to allow them to carry out some improvements in the City, and were\
        \ afraid to say him nay. Probably many of the valuable MSS. and ancient books\
        \ have found their way into private libraries. The building being of no further\
        \ use was turned into a cloth market. And there was no more City Library until\
        \ 1824. On the 8th of April in that year, Mr. Richard Lambert Jones moved\
        \ and carried in the Court of Common Council the appointment of a Committee,\
        \ to consider how \" a Library of all matters relating to this City, the Borough\
        \ of Southwark, and the County of Middlesex \" might be formed. On the report\
        \ of that Committee it was done, the purchases at first being confined to\
        \ books relating to the manners, customs, laws, privileges and history of\
        \ the City of London and the neighbouring localities. \" The condition of\
        \ the book market,\" says Mr. Welch, \"was then favourable for the procural\
        \ of old and scarce London books, private collectors being fewer than at present,\
        \ and our American rivals not being then in the field.\" So the books were\
        \ bought and catalogued by Mr. Upcott, of the London Institution, and the\

        boy, "you are robbing and plundering in company. There is no safety for an
        honest nation. Look at Pekin." I apologised for the summer palace spoliation
        as well as I could. " The English and the French are the greatest robbers
        on the face of the earth," said the German boy. "England has appro priated
        India without a shadow of right ; and you French, where ever you came you
        robbed and stole. In our public library at Treves there is a copy of the ''
        Gallerie Francaise ; '' a catalogue of pictures stolen by Napoleon, which
        he had to give back." I asked him if he would kindly hand me my right stocking,
        which lay on the grass beside him. I was getting rather the worst of the argument,
        you see. " Mind," he said, as he handed me the stocking, "when our turn conies
        we shall take what we want, and do, not as we have been done by, but simply
        do what is necessary for our own safety. However, we are friends. Where are
        you going ? " " To Treves." "I also. Come, aud I will show you Eiger. Come
        in my boat, I have a boat below." This was entirely delightful ; the German
        boy let his boat float down stream and talked to me the while." " French boy,"
        he said, " is your name Schneider ? " " Yes, Valentin Schneider." " You are
        to be let go where you will, and do what you like. My name is Von Lindenau,
        son of the Librarian at Treves. We have heard much of you. We hope to get
        your father on our side. You, however, are French, aud will remain French."
        I rather thought of throwing him out of the boat when he said this about my
        father ; but he looked very cool and strong, so I only said, with great heat,
        that my father was no traitor. " No, no," he said. " See where we are passing.
        This is the mouth of the Sarre. What battles have been fought here for eighteen
        centuries ! " My good humour was restored, and I begged his pardon for being
        angry. He bent over from his oars aud kissed me. " I wish you were a Gorman,"
        he said. " But about the battles ? " I asked ; " where are we now ? " " In
        the rift in the hills, which in old times divided Romau and Celt, and which
        now divide Teuton and Celt. Look to the left instead of looking into my eyes."
        I looked to the left, and there was the great monument of Eiger towering over
        thc trees. I held my breath ; it was the', 1]

        in Old Aberdeen, April S, 1726. Adam Sutherland, A.M., was admitted from Oldmachar,
        1662 ; and translated from Newmachar to Duffus, 1687. George Seaton was appointed,
        24 June, 1687, and died, December, 1704. He married Barbara Peddie, and had
        children, George, Alexander, John, and Anna Seaton. William Mitchell, formerly
        of Kearn, was ordained, 9 January, 1706. He married, 16 May, 1716 ; was recommended,
        13 May, 1717, for charitable supply. John Bisset was ordained, 13 March, 17
        17; was translated to Aberdeen, 26 September, 1728. Thomas Ray was licenced
        by the Presbytery of Aberdeen, 1729, but his licence was recalled because
        he accepted a presentation. It was restored by the Commission of Assembly,
        13 August, 1729, after presentation by the Principals and Masters, and was
        ordained by a Commission ofthe General Assembly, 29 October, the same year.
        There was considerable opposition on the part ofthe parishioners to his appointment.
        He was accused by the Presbytery of powdering his periwig on the Sabbath day,
        but was found not guilty by the General Assembly. He was deposed, 8 September,
        1736, for gross immorality and for deserting his charge. Thomas Reid, A.M.,

        at the parish school of Kincardine O''Neil, and subsequently at Aberdeen ;
        studied Philosophy under Dr. George Turnbull, at Marischal College ; was appointed
        librarian of King''s College, and presented to Newmachar by the Principal
        and Masters there. An aversion to the law of patronage, which then characterised
        many districts of Scotland, and Newmachar especially, excited hostile feelings
        against him, and he was admitted to the charge, after having been exposed
        to great personal danger. His unwearied attention to his duties, the mildness
        and forbearance of his manners, overcame all prejudice, and, on his departure,
        some one said, " We fought against Dr. Reid when he came, and we would have
        fought for him when he went away." In 1752, the Senatus of King''s College
        elected him Professor of Moral Philo sophy. In 1763, he was appointed Professor
        of Moral Philosophy in the University of Glasgow, and he retired from the

        \ in consequence of the Redistribution Act. Walmer is now in the electoral\
        \ division of St. Augustine's. In 1782, this parish was incorporated under\
        \ the provisions of Gilbert's Act, to form the River Union, in conjunction\
        \ with the following parishes: \u2014 Alkham, Buckland, Caple, Charlton, Ewell,\
        \ Eythorne, Upper Hill Folkestone, Hougham, St. James's Dover, Ringwould,\
        \ River, and Whitfield \u2014 which arrangement continued till the year 1835,\
        \ when the River Union was dissolved. Walmer thereupon joined the Eastry Union,\
        \ which was then formed under the provisions of the Poor Law Amend ment Act\
        \ (1834). The original village of Walmer having been mainly on the rising\
        \ ground at Upper Walmer, the character of the population, was, until a comparatively\
        \ recent date, to a great extent agricultural. Nevertheless, in the time of\
        \ Queen Elizabeth, the sea-faring element in this place was not much inferior\
        \ to what we then find at Deal ; for in 1586, when the latter place had six\
        \ vessels with a total tonnage of sixteen, Walmer had five with a total tonnage\
        \ of eleven. The fact is, that the growth of Deal is scarcely of older date\
        \ than that of Walmer. Leland, the antiquary, who was librarian to Henry VIII.,\
        \ describes Deal as \"a Fissheher village, half a myle fro ye shore of the\
        \ sea\" ; which, in plain terms, and according to modern standards, means,\
        \ that Deal was a very little place, that its inhabitants were chiefly of\
        \ the sea-faring class, and that they were content to live about a mile* from\
        \ the scene of their operations. Hasted says, respecting the ancient village\
        \ of Deal, that, \" the only village here was that called Upper Deal, which\
        \ was composed of the habitations of a few poor fishermen only,\" and Pritchard\
        \ traces the origin of Lower Deal to the \" settlement of sea-faring people\
        \ on its sea margin,\" consequent on the increase of trade and commerce, in\
        \ the time of Elizabeth. f Possibly by the time of Charles IL, the population\
        \ of Deal had increased to something like 2000 inhabi tants, but it could\
        \ scarcely have been more; for it should not be * For remarks on Leland's\
        \ \" half a mile \" see p. 2. t Prichard's History of Deal, p. 201.", 1]
    - ["History of Walmer. 2 Dovar the shore clyveth to Folkestane. From Walmer to\
        \ S. Margaretes II (two) and 2 miles to Dovar.\" About Leland's distances\
        \ something further will be said presently. The distance of this parish from\
        \ London is seventy-two miles. It appears to have been too much taken for\
        \ granted that a gradual recession of the sea from this part, has been going\
        \ on steadily and without interruption for many centuries ; an opinion founded\
        \ apparently on the assertion of Leland, that Deal in his time (temp. Hen.\
        \ VIII) was \" half a mile fro the shore of the se.\" But the length of the\
        \ old Kentish miles is proverbial. \" Essex stiles, Kentish miles, Norfolk\
        \ wiles, many men beguiles,\" runs the old proverb, according to Dr. Pegge,\
        \ who suggests in explanation that the miles in this county were once much\
        \ longer than they are now ; adding in confirmation of his opinion : \u2014\
        \ \" Stow reckons it but 55 miles from London to Dover, and now it is not\
        \ less than 75. Leland calls Wye but seven miles from Canterbury, and now\
        \ they esteem it full ten. From Betshanger to Canterbury, about 100 years\
        \ ago, 'twas eight, in the next generation it was ten, and now it is gotten\
        \ to be eleven miles . . . Sed audiamus R. Talbot in Comment. ad Antonius\
        \ Itin.. impresso ad finem torn. iii. Lei. Itinerarii, p. 139 \u2014 'ut ne\
        \ interim addam illud quod milliaria in Cantio longissima sint, adeo ut in\
        \ proverbium eorum Iongitudo abierit ; ' et p. 141 \u2014 'milliaria Cantica\
        \ sunt omnium longissima in hac insula.' \" The marvel is that persons with\
        \ local knowledge should have ever been misled by Leland's \" half-myle \"\
        \ ; when they have had the castles of Deal and Sandown before their eyes,\
        \ to bear witness to the fact, that in Henry VIII's time (and Leland was his\
        \ librarian), high-water line at Deal could scarcely have been further landward\
        \ than it is at present. The king would certainly take care to place his castles\
        \ at what appeared to be at the time a safe distance from the sea ; and we\
        \ have therefore proof positive that not one yard of recession has taken place\
        \ at the spots occupied by the two castles aforesaid, during the last three\
        \ hundred and fifty years ; there have been fluctuations, it is true, the\

        " Imma terialism" (Singer''s edition of Spence, 1858, p. 190, note). 1. 9,
        The digressions relating to Wotton and Bentley. The allusions to Bentley and
        Wotton in the " Tale of a Tub " are few and slight. The chief is in the "Epistle
        Dedicatory to Prince Posterity." Apparently Johnson refers to the " Battle
        of the Books," which appeared in the same volume as the " Tale of a Tub "
        (1704). The title runs, "A full and true Account of the Battle fought last
        Friday between tbe Ancient and the Modern Books in St. James''s Library" (Bell,
        i. 125 ; Scott, x. 217). William Wotton (1666-1726), an infant prodigy, who
        knew Latin, Greek, and Hebrew at the age of six, went to Cambridge at the
        age often, and obtained his degree before the age of thirteen. He replied
        to Temple''s " Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learn ng" in his "Reflections
        on Ancient and Modern Learn ing" (1694). He took holy orders, and was one
        of the first Englishmen to preach in Welsh. He showed great interest in Welsh
        antiquities. Richard Bentley (1662-1742), a Torkshireman, sizar at St. John''s
        College, Cambridge, took his B.A. degree in 1679. He became tutor to the son
        of Dr. Stillingfleet and accompanied him to Oxford. Through Stillingfleet''s
        influence he became librarian of the King''s Library, St. James''s Palace.
        His " Dis sertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris " was added by way of appendix
        to the second edition (1697) of Wotton''s " Reflections on Ancient and Modern
        Learning." This " Dissertation " he republished in a more extended form in
        1699. He was appointed Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1700, and
        spent the rest of his long life in quarrelling and litigation with the college,
        with the bishops of Ely as visitors of the college, and with the university.
        He edited Horace, Terence, and other classical authors, and produced a lamentable
        edition of Milton, which may be regarded as to some extent a reductio ad absurdum
        of the emendatory methods of classical scholarship. 1. 16, " Combat des Livres."
        This is not the title of any book yet discovered. Wotton, in his " Defence
        of the Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning " (1705), says : " I have
        been assured that the battle in St. James''s library is, mutatis mutandis,
        taken out of a Freneh book entitled '' Combat des Livres,'' if I mis-remember
        not." This is denied by Swift in tbe "Author''s Apology" prefixed to the "Tale
        of a Tub " in the fifth authorized edition (1710) ; he says he " has never
        heard of such a treatise ; " and goes on, " neither will he insist upon the
        mistake in the title ; but let the answerer and his friend produce any book
        they please, he defies them to show', 1]

        to 6ee the once handsome building, the great seat of learning for this province,
        a mass of cold, hard, cracked walls and smoking embers, and many of the old
        students, now professional men in the city, turned sadly homeward after view
        ing the destruction of their beloved alma mater." The library, with the exception
        of 100 volumes saved by the assistant librarian Mr. Brebner, consisted of
        about 33,000 books and was an absolute loss. Four large volumes of Audubon''s
        birds of Amer- ica, of which there are only known to be four other copies
        on this continent, were among the volumes which perished. They w-ere valued
        at $1,500, and the total value of the library was about $100,000. The total
        loss by the University fire reached the appalling total of $363,706, with
        no greater insurance than $150,000. Recently one of the professors of ''Varsity
        was asked to give some particulars of the great fire. He declined, and quoted
        for his reason a portion of the opening lines of the second book of the Aeneid,

        me to renew an unutterable grief which I myself have witnessed (experienced).

        great fire occurred in the city in the premises occupied by the Geudron Manu-
        facturing Company, on the south side of Wellington, just west of Yonge street.
        The flames, driven by the wind, extended to the east, and greatly damaged
        the pre- mises of White & Petter, dealers in lace and fancy goods. The fire
        originated iu the upper storey of Gendron''s, and by the strenuous exertions
        of the firemen it was confined almost wholly to the storey in which it commenced.
        The damage done to the buildiugs reached about $5,000, to the stock about
        $4,000. The insurance was ample. A month elapsed, and again on a Fri- day,
        on March 21, a fire broke out in the premises of the Brush Corset Com- pany,
        ou the north side of Adelaide, east of Bay street. The fire began at a few
        minutes before 8 p.m. For a short time it was feared that it would extend
        both east and west, but the firemen succeeded in confining its ravages to
        the point where it broke out. The loss, which was covered three times over
        by the insurance carried, amounted to $13,909. Some months passed away, and
        once more on a Friday was there another big blaze, the lumber yard and planing
        mills of Scott ,& Cross, on the north side of Hayter street, together with
        two small cottages, being greatly damaged by fire. The lead and colour works
        of A. G. Peuchen, on the north-west coruer of Front and Princess streets was
        very bad ly injured in the basement and first storey by a fire which broke
        out there on the night of October 5th, 1889. Much more damage though resulted
        from water but heavy as was the loss, nearly $15, 000, it was met by the amount
        of insur ance. Another big fire broke out on the night of November 29th in
        what is known as the Truth buildiug, on the south side of Adelaide, a little
        to the west of Bay street. The various occupants were : Truth Publishing Company,
        Auxiliary Publishing Company, Ladies'' Journal, S. F. and C. A. Wilson, Orange
        Sentinel, J. S. Williams, J. T. Reid, W. W. Wells, Joseph Moore, Toronto Paper
        Box Com pany, Churchill & Co., yeast manufac turers; G. T. Pendrith, machinist,
        and S. Crawford & Co., stamping. The Truth building was the home of a number
        of publishing firms and other industries. Among these the chief sufferers
        were Churchill & Co., J. S. Williams, Joseph Moore and the Truth Publishing
        Com pany. The building was destroyed so far as the interior was concerned
        at the back, but no great amount of damage was done in the front. The loss
        to the various occupants of the premises ex ceeded $14,000, which, most fortunately
        for them, was fully covered by the in surance carried. Valentine''s day, 1890,
        will ever be a memorable one in Toronto''s history, for on the evening of
        that day fire broke out in the University building, in the Queen''s Park,
        which in a few hours reduced that noble building to a heap of ruins. It was
        the day ou which the annual con versazione was to be held, and many of the
        rooms aud corridors were gaily deco rated in honour of the event. The cause
        of the fire was the upsetting of a lamp in one cf the corridors ; it broke
        and the oil caught fire, which spread with amaz ing rapidity. Up the stairway
        shot the flames, into the reading rooms, into the library, to convocation
