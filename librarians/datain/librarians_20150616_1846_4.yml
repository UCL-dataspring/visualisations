        \ the latter were sometimes sacrificed to the former. When Addison traversed\
        \ the principalities of Modena and Parma, he was scandalized by the magnificence\
        \ of thole petty courts: he was amazed to ice such a profusion of wealth laid\
        \ out in coaches, trappings, tables, cabinets, and the like precious toys,\
        \ in which there are few princes in Europe who can equal them, while, at the\
        \ some time, they have not the generosity to make bridges over the rivers\
        \ of their countries, for the convenience of their subjects, as well as strangers.\
        \ Yet the annals of Modena describe many public works of use as well as ornament:\
        \ the plenty of gold and silver is expressed in a single coinage of Francis1\
        \ 1., of near half a million sterling: but I am ignorant whetherthe two hundred\

        \ which were paid to the Emperor for the investitures of\" Corregio and Mirandola,\
        \ ssiould be placed to the account of treasure or of debt. In the narrow sphere\

        \ His equals by nature, they were many of them his superiors in merit: the\

    - ['HOUSE OF BRUNSWICK. 403 Milan, to reform and govern the ducal Library of Modena.
        The name of Muratori will be for ever connected with the literature of his
        country : above sixty years of his peaceful life were consumed in the exercises
        of study and devotion; his numerous writings on the subjects of history, antiquities,
        religion, morals, and criticisms, are impressed with sense and knowledge,
        with moderation and candour : he moved in the narrow circle of an Italian
        priest ; but a desire of freedom, a ray of philosophic light sometimes breaks
        through his own prejudices and those of his readers. In the cause of his Prince,
        he was permitted, and even encouraged, to explore the foun dations, and to
        circumscribe the limits, of the temporal power of the Bissiops of Rome : and
        his victorious arguments in the dispute for Commachio accustomed the slave
        to an erect pos ture and a bolder step. One of his antagonists, the learned
        Fontanini, had been provoked, in the heat of controversy, to cast some reflexions
        on the family of Este, as if they had been no more than simple citizens of
        Padua, who, in the thirteenth century, were invested by the Popes with the
        title and office of Marquis of Ancona. Truth and honour required an an swer
        to this invidious charge; and the firmest answer was a simple and genuine
        exposition of facts. The courts of Bruns wick and Modena were joined in the
        same family interest; and their trusty Librarians, Leibnitz and Muratori,
        corres ponded with the confidence of allies and the emulation of rivals. But
        the speed of the German was outstripped in the race by the perseverance of
        the Italian : if the conjectures of Muratori were less splendid, his discoveries
        were more sore; and he could examine, with the leisure of a native, the mo
        numents and records which his associate had formerly viewed with the haste
        of a traveller. After a diligent enquiry of three years, both at home and
        abroad, he gave to the world the first volume of the Antichitd Eflense, a
        model of genealo gical criticism ; and in the second volume, which was delayed
        above twenty years, he continues the descent and series to his own times.
        The more strenuous labours of his life were devoted to the general and particular
        history of Italy. His antiquities, botn in the vulgar and the Latin tongue,
        exhibit a curious picture of the laws and manners of the middle age; and a
        correct text is justified by a copious Appendix of au thentic documents. His
        Annals are a faithful abstract of the twenty-eight folio volumes of original
        historians ; and what soever faults may be noticed in this great collection,
        our cen sure is disarmed by the remark, that it was undertaken and finissied
        by a single man. Muratori will not aspire to the Dd2 kme', 1]

    - ['4<>> ANTIQJJITIES OF THE deemed either a praise or a reproach, that the raw
        materials are often less valuable than the observations and prefaces of the
        editor himself. In the year 1695, the nuptials of the Prince of Modena with
        a Princess of Hanover engaged him to dispel the errors and fables of preceding
        genealogists, and to restore the true connection of the kindred branches,
        which were thus united, after a separation of more than six hundred years.
        This occasional pamphlet was designed as the prelude of the great Latin work
        which he meditated on the Brunswick Anti- quities. With a genius accustomed
        to draw lines of commu- nication between the most distant sciences, he traced,
        in his Introduction, the revolutions of the country and its inhabi- tants;
        of the country, from the natural remains of fossils and petrefactions; of
        the inhabitants, from the national vestiges of language and manners. The story
        of a province and of a family swelled, in his capacious mind, into the annals
        of the western empire: the origins of the Guelphs of Bavaria, and the Marquisses
        of Este, would have been interwoven in their proper place; and the narrative.
        would have been deduced from the reign of Charlemagne (A. D. 769.) to the
        last Emperor of the Saxon line (1025). But the term of an antediluvian life
        would have been scarcely adequate to the labours and pro jects of Leibnitz:
        the imperfect manuscript of his Annals were buried in the Library of Hanover
        ; and the impression, though long since promised, is still refused to the
        curiosity of the Public. But the ideas and papers of that great man were freely
        communicated to his disciple and successor Eccard, and the researches more
        particularly belonging to the House of Brunswick have formed the basis of
        the Origines Gueifica, which were compiled by the industrious historiographer.
        The rassinefs of Eccard, who changed his service and religion, condemned his
        work, till envy and malevolence had subsided, to a long oblivion ; nor was
        it till many years after his decease that the Origines Gueifica were printed
        in five volumes in folio, by the care of the Electoral Librarians. Tne hands
        of the several workmen are apparent ; the bold and original spirit of Leibnitz,
        the crude erudition and hasty conjectures of Eccard, the useful annotations
        of Gruber, and the critical disquisitions of Scheid, the principal editor
        of this genealo gical History. In the construction of this domestic monument,
        the Elector of Hanover, ten years after the return of Leibnitz, had dis patched
        a second missionary (1700) to search the archives of his Italian kinsmen.
        Their archives were in the most deplo rable state : but the Princes of Este
        were awakened by ssiame and vanity, and their subject Muratori was recalled
        from Milan,', 1]

        him from promoting learning by labours of a different kind ; for, besides
        many poems and orations which he recited on different occasions, he wrote

        He was twice rector, or chief governor of the university, and discharged that

        to his honours and revenues, which he might justly claim ; and afterwards,
        as a proof of the continuance of their regard, and a testimony that his reputation

        of Muratori will be for ever connected with the literature of his country
        : above sixty years of his peaceful life were consumed in the exercises of
        study and devotion; his numerous writings on the subjects of history, antiquities,
        religion, morals, and criticisms, are impressed with fense and knowledge,
        with moderation and candour : he moved in the narrow circle of an Italian
        priest ; but a desire of freedom, a ray of philosophic light sometimes breaks
        through his own prejudices and those of his readers. In the cause of his Prince,
        he was per- mitted, and even encouraged, to explore the foundations, and to
        circum- scribe the limits, of the temporal power of the Bisoops of Rome :
        and his victorious arguments in the dispute for Commachio accustomed the slave
        to an erect posture and a bolder step. One of his antagonists, the learned
        Fon- tanini, had been provoked, in the heat of controversy, to cast some reflexions
        on the family of Este, as if they had been no more than simple citizens of
        Pa- dua, who, in the thirteenth century, were invested by the Popes with the
        title and office of Marquis of Anconia. Truth and honour required an an- swer
        to this invidious charge ; and the firmest answer was a simple and genuine
        exposition of facts. The courts of Brunswick and Modena were joined in the
        same family interest; and their trusty Librarians, Leibnitz and Muratori,
        corresponded with the confidence of allies and the emulation of rivals. But
        the speed of the German was outstripped in the race by the perseverance of
        the Italian : if the conjectures of Muratori were less splendid, his discoveries
        were more sore ; and he could examine, with the leisure of a native, the monuments
        and records which his associate had formerly viewed with the haste of a traveller.
        After a diligent enquiry of three years, both at home and abroad, he gave
        to the world the first volume of the Antichitd Eftense, a model of genealogical
        criticism ; and so the second volume, which was de- layed above twenty years,
        he continues the descent and series to his own times. The more strenuous labours
        of his life were devoted to the general and particular history of Italy. His
        Antiquities, both in the vulgar and the Latin tongue, exhibit a curious picture
        of the laws and manners of the mid- dle ace ; and a correct text is justified
        by a copious Appendix of authentic documents. His Annals are a faithful abstract
        of the twenty-eight folio vo lumes of original historians; and whatsoever
        faults may be noticed in this great collection, our censure is disarmed by
        the remark, that it was under taken and finifed by a single man. Muratori

    - ['ANTI QJJ ITIES OF THE 700 mands of war, but which might support, with decent
        ceconomy, the ex pences of a court and government. Perhaps the latter were
        sometimes sa crificed to the former. When Addison traversed the principalities
        of Mo dena and Parma, he was scandalized by the magnificence of those petty
        courts : he was amazed to fee such a profusion of wealth laid out in coaches,
        trappings, tables, cabinets, and the like precious toys, in which there are
        few princes in Europe who equal them, while, at the fame time, they have not
        had the generosity to make bridges over the rivers of their countries, for
        the convenience of their subjects, as well as strangers. Yet the annals of
        Mo dena describe many public works of use as well as ornament : the plenty
        of gold and silver is expressed in a single coinage of Francis I., of near
        half a million sterling : but I am ignorant whether the two hundred and thirty
        thousand ducats, and the two hundred thousand Spaniso doubloons, which were
        paid to the Emperor for the investitures of Corregio and Mirandola, soould
        be placed to the account of treasure or of debt. In the narrow sphere of their
        dominions, the Este princes were absolute ; nor do I find any example of resistance
        to their reason or passion. The vanity of the hu man heart is flattered by
        the degree, rather than by the extent, of authority : and if the sovereign
        was conscious of his duties, the man might tremble at accepting the trust
        of one hundred and fifty thousand of his equals. His equals by nature, they
        were many of them his superiors in merit : the na tives of Modena were distinguissied
        in the arts and sciences; and like the pastoral comedy, the mock-heroic poetry
        of the Italians was invented by Tassoni, a subject of the House of Este. The
        state of such a prince would perhaps be the most desirable in human life,
        if it were accompanied with that domestic security which a wealthy nobleman
        enjoys under the protection ofa great empire. The long peace of Italy, in
        the seventeenth century, was in terrupted only by some soort and bloodless
        hostilities : but in the three great wars between the Austrian and Bourbon
        powers, the Duke of Modena has been thrice reduced to the alternative of slavery
        or exile. His neutrality was violated, his dominions were occupied by foreign
        troops, his subjects were oppressed by military contributions, and the mischievous
        expence of fortifi cations only served to expose his cities to the calamities
        ofa siege. I have long delayed, and I soould willingly suppress, three disgraceful
        anecdores, three criminal actions, which fully the honour of the name of Este

        In the year 1695, the.nup tials of the Prince of Modena with a Princess of
        Hanover engaged him to difpell the errors and fables of preceding genealogists,
        and to restore the true connection of the kindred branches, which were thus
        united, after a separa tion of more than six hundred years. This occasional
        pamphlet was designed as the prelude of the great Latin work which he meditated
        on the Brunswick Antiquities. With a genius accustomed to draw fines of communication
        be tween the most distant sciences, he traced, in his Introduction, the revolutions
        of the country and its inhabitants; of the country, from the natural remains
        of fossils and petrefactions ; of the inhabitants, from the national vestiges
        of language and manners. The story ofa province and ofa family swelled, in
        his capacious mind, into the annals of the western empire : the origins of
        the Guelphs of Bavaria, and the Marquisses of Este, would have been inter
        woven in their proper place; and the narrative would have been deduced from
        the reign of Charlemagne (A. D. 769.), to the last Emperor of the Saxon line
        (1025). But the term of an antediluvian life. would have been scarcely adequate
        to the labours and projects of Leibnitz r the imperfect ma nuscript of his
        Annals was buried in the Library of Hanover; and the im pression, though long
        since promised, is still refused ;to the curiosity of the Public. But the
        ideas and papers of that great man were freely communi cated to his disciple
        and successor Eccard, and the researches more particu larly belonging to the
        House of Brunswick have formed the basis of the Origines Guelfice, which were
        compiled by the industrious historiographer. The rasonefs of Eccard, who changed
        his service and religion,, condemned his work, till envy and malevolence had
        subsided, to a long oblivion; nor was it till many years after his decease
        that the Origines Guelfice were printed in five volumes. in folio, by the
        care of the Electoral Librarians. The hands of the several workmen are apparent
        ; the bold and original spirit of Leib nitz, the crude erudition and hasty
        conjectures of Eccard, the useful annota tions of Gruber, and the critical
        disquisitions of Scheid, the principal editor of this genealogical History.
        In the construction of this domestic monument, the Elector of Hanover, ten
        years after the return of Leibnitz, had dispatched a second missionary (1700)
        to search the _ archives of his Italian kinsmen. Their archives were in the
        most deplorable state : but the Princes of Este were awakened by soame and
        vanity, and their subject Muratori was recalled from Milan, to re- 7 form',

        \ city. The five sons of Al- phonso I., with the sole distinction of primogeniture,\
        \ were educated as equals and companions. Don Alphonso, the sost-born of Laura,\
        \ was treated as a prince, both at home and abroad : he was invested with\
        \ the Marquifate of Montecchio, and the French order of St. Michael; and his\

        a most happy situation but is laid out with great taste, and kept in perfect
        order. It is chiefly covered with green sward, which is pleasing to the eye,
        especially in a city, and is most agreeable to walk on. It lies along the
        river, is of great extent, and has a spacious gravel walk, or terrace, on
        the bank of the Thames. The Middle Temple also has a garden, but much smaller,
        and not so advantageously situated. The hall of the Middle Temple is a spacious
        and elegant room in its style. Many great feasts have been given in it in
        old times. It is well worth a visit. In the treasury chamber of the Middle
        Temple is preserved a great quantity of armour, which belonged to the Knights
        Templars j consisting of helmets, breast and back pieces, to gether with several
        pikes, a halberd, and two very beautiful shields, with iron spikes in their
        centres, of the length of six inches in diameter, and each of about twenty
        pounds weight. They are curiously engraved, and one of them richly inlaid
        with gold : the insides are lined with leather stuffed, and the edges adorned
        with silk fringe ; and broad leathern belts are fixed to them, for the bearers
        to sling them upon their shoulders. The Inner Temple hall is comparatively
        small, but is a fine room ; it is ornamented with the portraits of several
        of the judges. Before this hall is a broad paved terrace, forming an excellent
        promenade, when the gardens are not sufficiently dry. There are two good libraries
        belonging to these societies, open to students, and to others on application
        to the librarian, from ten in the morning till one ; and in the afternoon
        from two till six. i i The', 1]

        Museum. This arrangement, however, was a few years ago destroyed ; and the
        only collec tions now preserved entire are the library of Mr. Clayton Cracherode,
        bequeathed in 1799; Mr. Garrick''s collection of ancient plays ; and the very
        large and valuable assortment of pamphlets during the time of Charles the
        First, presented by his present majesty ; with a valuable collection of biography,
        given by Sir William Musgrave : the remainder of the library is arranged scientifically
        ; and, in the centre, is now deposited the celebrated triple inscription from
        Rosetta. The coins are exceedingly numerous, and have been lately enriched,
        at the expense of above two hundred pounds, with a fine series of those of
        our Saxon kings, from the cabinet of the late Mr. Tyssen, together with one
        of the only two gold pennies known of King Henry the Third. The ancient charters
        belonging to Sir Robert Cotton''s manuscripts are preserved in the manuscript
        department ; but the Harleian collection, which amounts to many thousands,
        are preserved in one of the garrets : they are all individually catalogued
        and indexed, and may be referred to immediately. The Museum is kept open every
        day in the week, except Saturday, the weeks which follow Christmas-day, Easter
        and Whitsundays, Thanksgiving and Fast-days. The hours are from ten till four.
        Literary characters, or any person who wishes to make use of the Museum for
        purposes of study and reference, may obtain permission, by applying with proper
        recommendations to the trustees, through the medium of the principal librarian.

        At the top of the angle stands the Shire-Hall, lately erected at the expence
        ofthe County. At the back of the Shire-Hall is the Town- Hall and Goal. The
        University of Cambridge, not inferior to any in Christen^ dom, consists of
        12 colleges, and 4 Halls, which have the same privi leges as the Colleges.
        The whole body, which is commonly about 1500^ enjoys very great privileges,

        it to send 2 Members to Par liament, as the town had done from the first.
        The University is go verned by a Chancellor, High Steward, Vice Chancellor,
        two Proctors, two Moderators, two Scrutators, a Commissary, Public Orator,
        two Librarians, a Register, a School-Keeper, three Esquire Beadles, and a

        a Doctor of Divinity, a Doctor of LaWs, a Doctor of Physic, a Regent, and
        a Non-Regent Master of Arts. Henry VI. granted it the power to print all books
        of any kind within itself, a privilege which Oxford had not. The Senate-House,
        allowed to contain the most superb room in England, being IOi feet long, 42

        It has a gallery capable of containing a thousand persons. The Colleges of
        the. University are extremely grand and beautiful. In the Library are to be
        seen the first editions of the Greek and Latin classics, and historians, and
        the greatest part of the works of the first printers ; large collections of
        prints by the greatest masters ; and a valuable MS. of the gospels and acts
        of the apostles, on vellum, in Greek and Latin capitals, given to the University
        by Theodore Beza, and supposed to be as old as any MS. extant. From this,
        and the Clermont copy of St. Pauls''s epistles, Beza published his larger
        annotations, in 1582. The principal manufactures ofthe county are malt, paper,
        and baskets. The town has fairs on June 24, and Au gust 14, for horses, wood,
        and earthen-ware. Markets, Wednesday and Saturday. The Members for thecounty

        \ of temper, nor anxieties about popular applause. Lord Manners is distinguished\
        \ by far different traits. Soundness of judgment, quick decision, a rigid\
        \ adherence to justice, affability, and a dignified politeness, are the cha\
        \ racteristics of this gentleman. He commands respect from the meanest individual,\
        \ and obtains confidence without encouraging too much familiarity. Beloved\

        \ can be said of few, that in public confidence he is unrivalled, and that\
        \ he has not a single enemy. From a numerous body of gentlemen at the bar\
        \ in Ireland, the judges and master of the rolls are selected; but before\
        \ I proceed, it may be proper to take a . general view of their situation\
        \ as advocates. There is a society, with an establishment, called the King's\
        \ Inns, where students in the law are admitted to the bar ; but there are\
        \ no chambers for transacting the business, as in London. Barris ters, therefore,\
        \ live in all parts of the city; and during every stage of their pro fession,\
        \ mix with society at large, and participate in the general feelings of the\
        \ great mass of the people. They do not confine themselves to the practice\
        \ of one court, as is the case in London, but plead occasionally in all. Those\
        \ who have had an op portunity of witnessing the severe duties of an eminent\
        \ barrister in London, know that from the multiplicity of his business, he\
        \ is closely confined to his chambers, and se cluded from general society\
        \ : of course, little leisure is afforded him of acquiring a knowledge of\
        \ mankind or manners. But in this respect, the Irish barrister has the ad\
        \ vantage ; he is in consequence a more agreeable companion in private life.\
        \ The English lawyers, whose minds are exclusively directed to their profession,\
        \ have little inter course with what is termed \" the world.\" Compared with\
        \ the leadingmen in other professions, their acquaintance is contracted within\
        \ a narrow circle ; by which, perhaps, they are enabled to pursue that impartial\
        \ line of conduct, for which they are so much distinguished. In Ireland, while\
        \ she had a parliament, her barristers who had attained to any emi nence,\
        \ always found their way into the House of Commons. But they felt no anxiety\
        \ as general politicians, their object being that of haranguing for promotion\
        \ to the bench. No preparation for the office of judge, can, in my opinion,\
        \ be worse ; and it is one benefit of the Union, that a wider field is opened\
        \ for legal practice, and for the acquirement of legal knowledge The extinction\
        \ of the parliament is so recent, that there are still on the bench judges\

        the best head and most cultivated mind) that the blow which was likely to
        fall on Austria, would operate iu Portugal ; and finally, and most materially,
        against the convents, I wished him to understand that I considered this as
        the moment in which they ought to be occupied in making a provision for the

        The convent contained in this palace gave shelter formerly to 200 friars,
        who have their cells, refectories, cha- pels, and every thing usually found
        in large con- vents. The monks are at this time reduced to thirty. In this
        part of the palace is contained the handsomest and best library in Portugal.
        I saw several of the early editions of the classics, and many of the English
        provincial histories ; but the body of divinity, if I may judge from its bulk,
        must be unrivalled. The room which contains this library is a magnificent
        gallery, 100 yards long, and about 25 broad, paved with different marbles.
        This was the usual walk of the Prince Regent and his children, who used to

        a library, con- sisting of every publication respecting American affairs,
        or visits made by Brit- ish subjects to other parts of the world, gave that
        library to ''; the Society for pro- pagating the gospel in foreign parts."
        The library, to save storage, was removed to Gresham college; but the librarian
        died and the books were dispersed. Mr. Archdale''s work, and sundry other
        publica- tions of that period, are only to be found at present in the British
        museum. Doc- tor Romayne, who ten years ago was in London, in the most obliging
        manner caused copies to be made of all the valu- able information, that is
        contained in Mr. Archdale''s work, or in two other small books, respecting
        North Carolina, that were published about the end of the seventeenth century.

        \ WHETHER Ireland was known to the Ph\u0153nicians who frequented the coasts\
        \ of Cornwall for the purpose of procuring tin, is uncertain ; because no\
        \ authentic in formation on that subject has been preserved.* The earliest\
        \ notice, perhaps, to be depended on, which we have of it, is that of Eratosthenes,\
        \ librarian to Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, who flourished about two\
        \ centuries and a half before the Christian \xE6ra. The works of this eminent\
        \ mathematician and geographer have been lost ; but Strabo, who frequently\
        \ refers to them, and who seems to have been indebted to him for many observations,\
        \ praises his private collection of books,+ and remarks, that he was so well\
        \ acquainted with the western parts of Europe, that he determined the distance\
        \ of Ireland from Celtica.^ The first Roman author who speaks of it is C\xE6\
        sar; he calls it Hibernia, a name said to be given to it by the Romans on\
        \ account of its supposed coldness ; and he * Had the Ph\u0153nicians been\
        \ acquainted with Ireland, it is probable they would have concealed their\
        \ know ledge of it, because they were exceedingly jealous of their commerce,\
        \ and unwilling to let other nations know the sources from which they derived\
        \ their riches. The story of the Ph\u0153nician ship-master, who, on a voyage\
        \ to Britain, observing a Roman vessel following him in order to watch his\
        \ course, voluntarily run his own vessel on a shoal for the purpose of misleading\
        \ the Roman, is well known. The wily Ph\u0153nician, who was a better seaman,\
        \ found means to escape ; but the Roman, less skilful, was'Iost. The former,\

        the last volumes, as the extensive sources of in formation I have found in
        the British Museum, and the zealous assistance I have received from Mr. Planta,
        the principal librarian of that rich collection, have enabled me to elucidate
        some parts of the English history hitherto unknown, and to rectify errors
        of some importance, though adopted by learned and esteemed authors, who, having
        published historical, works previous to the establishment of the British Museum,
        had not the invaluable resource of consulting its manuscripts. These new-discovered
        facts and elucidations, introduced for the first time in the History of Great

        rapidity and concision to the narrative, by avoiding the necessity of con
        necting incoherent facts with one another, and the prolixity attending it.
        This way of speaking, when carried too far, has certainly the inconvenience
        of tiring the reader''s attention, and, moreover, as the Critical Review has
        most properly observed, the transition from the present tense to the past,
        often produces awkwardness and confusion. This method is however peculiarly
        adapted to chronological abridg ments; there is not a page, nay, a single

        I .say maliciously, thus positively, because it was so blotted as to render
        that identical passage perfectly illegible, not a word of any of the rest
        being obscured ; and because, if an accident, he would naturally have run
        to the librarian in the first impulse, and have used his efforts to get it
        remedied immediately ; instead of which, he allowed the blot to dry on, having
        succeeded un fortunately to the utmost in his miserable design. Every means
        has been resorted to, in order to take off the ink, but without effect. The
        paper with his signature is preserved and shewn with the book. In this volume

        by Beroaldus : a m. s. of Petrarch''s works, with portraits of himself and
        mistress, considered the most faithful likenesses which exist : a Horace interlined,
        it is supposed, by Petrarch himself: a Boccaccio written by one of his cotemporaries
        : the well-known Pandects, brought by the Pisans from Constantinople, which
        were taken by the Florentines at the subjugation ofthe Pisan republic. These
        Pandects have been noticed by former tourists as being in the old pa- lace,
        who say also that they were brought by the Pisans from the port of Amalfi

        \ Paris, the Chouan chiefs, and other royalists in La Vendee, Mere engaged\
        \ in a secret correspondence with certain emigrants in Eng land', and, through\
        \ them, with the British ministry. The vigilance of the deputies on mission\
        \ in that depart ment, in the month of 3Iay, detected this correspond ence\
        \ ; and Cormartin and six other chiefs were arrested on the evidence of certain\
        \ intercepted letters. About the latter end of the same month, the Chouans\
        \ began to embody in considerable force, and Grand Champ was blockaded, on\
        \ the 27th, by one thousand two hundred of the insurgents. On the following\
        \ day, at sour in the morning, however, the deputy Buc, with a large body\
        \ of republicans, came up with the rebel army, which consisted of about six\
        \ thousand, encamped in the old castle of Reste, and before Grand Champ. The\
        \ chiefs Mere surprised in their beds, and the Chouans were defeated and dispersed.\
        \ galleries for the people were arranged so as to admit no more than two hundred\
        \ and fifty spectators. The conduct of the directory was how calculated to\
        \ relieve the public mind from the apprehension of Ja cobin dominion. It became\
        \ evidently the determina tion of the government to adhere firmly to the consti\
        \ tution, and aM*e every faction into submission. When ever just complaints\
        \ were brought forward ofthe agents of the administration, they were dismissed\
        \ ; and every peaceable citizen rallied around a government which, after all\
        \ the terrible tempests of the revolution, seemed to promise a degree of tranquillity\
        \ and protection. The executive directory, soon after its instalment, published\
        \ a proclamation, by which it declared, that, being convinced that the happiness\
        \ of the French people M*as inseparable from the perfection of arts and sciences,\
        \ and the increase of human knowledge, \u2014 and desiring to manifest in\
        \ a solemn manner to all France, and to all civilised nations, its firm resolution\
        \ to concur, as far as its poM'er extended, to the progress and en couragement\
        \ of science, it had founded a national institution, composed of one hundred\
        \ and forty-four members, whom it had appointed, and ordered their installation\
        \ to take place in the hall of the former aca demy of sciences, in the palace\
        \ of the national museum, formerly the Louvre. Among the members were La Place,\
        \ La Lande, Bertholet, Fourcroy, Volney, Raynal, Marmontel, Bitauby, Pastoret,\
        \ &c. This proclamation of the directory, which the legislative body had sanc\
        \ tioned by a decree, directed further, that the national academy should hold\
        \ four public meetings in a year. An expedition to the coast of Brittanny\
        \ had in the mean time been meditated by the British government, for the purpose\
        \ of attacking France in the most vulne rable point. A number of regiments\
        \ were accordingly raised and embodied; consisting partly of the unfortu nate\
        \ Toulonese, who had been compelled to abandon their country, and partly of\
        \ those who had retired from France at different periods. As the number of\
        \ volunteers for this desperate undertaking was insuffi cient, a multitude\
        \ of prisoners were recruited from the gaols, a measure which had nearly proved\
        \ fatal, as some of the troops exhibited a spirit of mutiny imme diately after\
        \ they sailed. A new plan of public instruction was also establish ed. It\
        \ consisted of primary schools, central schools, and special schools. A primary\
        \ school was erected in each canton, where a master was appointed for the\
        \ boys, and a mistress for the girls, and where the pupils M'ere to remain\
        \ till twelve years of age. At those schools were taught reading, writing,\
        \ and the first ele ments of arithmetic. The youthful but promising Count\
        \ de Sombreuil, whose extraordinary courage had obtained a military decoration\
        \ from the King of Prussia ; and the Count d'Hervilly, a general anterior\
        \ to the revolution, were prevailed upon to engage in this expedition. The\
        \ chief command, however, was given to 31. de Puisaye, formerly adjutant-general\
        \ to Winipfien, who possessed considerable influence among the Chouans, havinn-\
        \ for merly been one of their leaders. On this account, he was chosen to direct\
        \ this important enterprise; but, unfortunately, he was destitute both of\
        \ military talents and of the confidence of the troops. One central school\
        \ was established in each depart ment, with nine professors, who were to teach\
        \ drawing, the ancient languages, history and belles-lettres, natural history,\
        \ mathematics, experimental philosophy, general grammar, and legislation.\
        \ The professors were to be chosen by a jury appointed by the department,\
        \ and to have the same revenue as the administrators of the department, upon\
        \ which they might retire after twenty five years of service. Each central\
        \ school was to have a library and librarian, a cabinet of natural history,\
        \ an apparatus of experimental philosophy, and a botanical garden. Five or\

        Since the time of Al drovandi most of the statues have been restored in the
        parts that were deficient ; in some the restorations are the work of modern

        The collection of books consists of between 90,000 and 100,000 volumes ; access
        to it is easy, and under proper regulations, individuals may be accommodated
        by taking books to their own houses. I was sorry to remark that they were
        badly arranged, and that there is no printed catalogue of them. The librarian
        and his assistants are very attentive, and as far as they can, remedy the
        evil I have mentioned. In the collection are some valuable specimens of early
        typography. Cicero''s Offices, printed on parchment by Faust, at Mentz, in
        1465. A translation of the New Testa ment by Luther, in 1522 ; in which the
        disputed passage of the three witnesses is not to be found in St. John''s
        Epistle. A Greek Testament, printed at Alcala de Henares, in Spain, where
        the same verse is seen, printed eight years before, in 1514. I was much pleased
        with some illuminated manuscripts; one a breviary most beautifully coloured,
        said to have been presented to our Henry VIII., by the Emperor Charles V.
        There is also the book of Esther, most curiously copied with a pen, and illustrated
        with drawings in a very uncommon style, which must have been executed at an
        enormous expense of time and labour. A very copious collection of the au tographs

        which reason he determined to destroy him. Antiochus being informed of his
        design, avoided the danger by a speedy retreat into Egypt ; where he rather
        chose to deliver himself up to the power of Ptolemy, the professed enemy of
        his house, than to trust a brother whom he had so highly offended. He however
        had reason to repent of this proceeding, for immediately after his arrival
        in Egypt, Ptolemy caused him to be seized and impri soned ; d he also placed
        a strong guard over him, and detained him several years in that confinement,
        till at last he found means to escape by the assistance of a courtezan ; but
        as he was quitting that kingdom, he had the misfortune to be as sassinated
        by a band of robbers. e Ptolemy, in the mean time, devoted the sweets of peace
        to the cultivation of the sciences in his dominions, and the enlargement of
        his father''s library at Alexandria with all sorts of books : but as a proper
        collection could not well be made without an able librarian, to whose care
        it would be likewise necessary to consign them, ? Evergetes, upon the death
        of Zenodotus, who had exercised that function from the time of Ptolemy Soter,
        the grandfather of that prince, sent to Athens for Eratosthenes the Cyrenian,
        who was then in great reputa tion, and had been educated by Callimachus, a
        native of the same country, s He was a man of universal learning, but none
        of his works have been transmitted to us, except his catalogue of the kings
        of Thebes in Egypt, with the years of their respective reigns, from Menes,
        or Misraim, who first peopled Egypt after the deluge, to the Trojan war. This
        ca talogue contains a succession of thirty-eight kings, and is still to be

        his brother had occasioned, his first cares were employed in the re-establishment
        of order and tranquillity in the dominions he possessed ; and when he had
        accomplished this, he turned his thoughts to the reduction of the oriental
        provinces which had revolted from him. This last attempt, however, was not
        attended with success ; for Arsaces had been allowed too much time to strengthen
        himself in his usurpation. Seleucus, therefore, after many ineffectual endeavours
        to recover those territories, was obliged to discontinue his enterprise in
        a dis honourable manner. He, perhaps, might have succeeded d A. M. 3778. Ant.

        \ him to come to him, he ordered bim to be bound with chains of gold, and\
        \ soon after put him to death. That son had done him great servi ces in the\

        does great credit to the taste of the gentlemen who planned and executed it.
        Amongst them I may mention Messrs Von Reden, Patje, Ramberg, Hoffner, and
        Brandes. They were the original proposers of the monument, which was erected
        by subscription. The government contributed liberally, and it was completed

        It is pleasing to record the modesty which did not al low these gentlemen
        to engrave their own names on the temple which they had raised to Leibnitz.
        To appropriate to ourselves a share of the honour we confer, in giving money
        to raise a memorial to an illustrious man, is often a great motive for giving
        it. And, if the names of artists, subscribers, and munificent princes, were

        a complete repair. The stone front is to be beautified; and the two weather-cocks
        are already re-gilt, and surmounted by a royal crown. Iu Castle Street, a
        little behind The Mews, is a library sounded by Dr. Tennison, in the year
        1685, for the use of bis school, over which it is placed, and now consists
        of upwards of five thousand volumes. In 1697, the Doctor, who was then vicar
        of St. Martin''s, and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, gave 1000/. towards
        a fund for the maintenance of his school ; and afterwards, by the con sent
        of Dr. Patrick, bishop of Ely, and another sum of 500/. which had been left
        to them jointly, in trust, to be disposed of in charitable uses : which two
        sums, together with two leasehold messuages, for the term of forty years,
        he vested in trustees, for the support of his school and library ; out of

        thirty boys, sons of inhabitants of St. Martin''s parish. We will now retrograde

        the abbot and monks of Westminster, whence it was called Convent Gar den,
        a name since corrupted into Covent, and sometimes Com mon Garden. At the dissolution
        of religious houses it fell to the Crown, and was given first to Edward Duke

        dynasties I have followed the text of Africanus, as quoted by Syncellus, in
        preference to that of Eusebius who has sadly defaced it. The general outline
        is the same, though the names of the kings, and the length of their respective
        reigns frequently differ, as well as the collocation and num bers of the dynasties.
        I have availed myself of the text of Eusebius to correct grammatical errors
        ; but where any material difference occurs, I have inserted the variation
        in a parenthesis, or observed it in a note. The numerical letters or figures
        I have given from Africanus without noticing those of Eusebius as very little
        dependence can be placed on either. The Laterculus or Canon of the Kings of
        Thebes was compiled from the archives of that city by Eratosthenes, the librarian
        to Ptolemy Phila delphus. It is to be found in Syncellus and other writers.

        is exceedingly well planned, spacious, and commodious ; and among the apartments
        is a very elegant circular room, with columns of the Ionic order. Of this
        collection, which con tains 350,000 printed volumes, and 12,000 ma nuscripts,
        the celebrated Zalusky library, that was removed hither from Warsaw, may be
        con sidered as the nucleus. The classification here adopted is at once simple
        and perspicuous, the books being arranged in three grand divisions ; viz.
        the sciences, arts, and philology. There are seven librarians, and as many
        sub-librarians ; of whom the former have salaries of 1200, and the latter
        900 rubles. These officers are obliged to sleep in the house. The library
        has of late years received a great acquisition of French works and manuscripts,
        which had been collected by Dubrovsky, who was in the suite of the Russian
        ambassador at Paris at the period of the Revolution, when he was enabled to
        obtain them for almost any thing. The whole of these he sold to government
        for 60,000 rubles. Two copies of every book published must be presented to
        this library ; and it may be added, that four hundred publications appeared
        the year before we visited Russia. The first manuscript I shall mention contains

        \ a burden to him ; for which reason he determined to destroy him. Anti ochus,\
        \ being informed of his design, avoided the danger by a speedy retreat into\
        \ Egypt; where he rather chose to deliver himself up to Ptole my, the professed\
        \ enemy of his house, than to trust a brother whom he had so highly offended.\
        \ He, however, had reason to repent of this pro ceeding, for immediately after\
        \ his arrival in \u2022Egypt-i Ptolemy caused him to be seized and imprisoned\

        \ years in that confine- ment, till at last he found means to escape by the\
        \ assistance of a courte zan ; but as he was quitting that kingdom he had\
        \ the misfortune to be assassinated by a band of robbers. been allowed too\
        \ much time to strengthen him self in his usurpation. Seleucus, therefore,\
        \ after many ineffectual endeavours to recover those territories, was obliged\
        \ to discontinue his enter prise in a dishonourable manner. He, perhaps, might\
        \ have succeeded better in time, if new commotions, which had been excited\
        \ in his do minions during his absence, had not compelled him to make a speedy\
        \ return, in order to sup press them. This furnished Arsaces with a new opportunity\
        \ of establishing his power so effectually, that all future efforts were incapable\
        \ of shaking it. Seleucus,8 however, made A. M. 3774. a new attempt, as soon\
        \ as Ant. J. C. 230. his affairs would admit : but this second expedition\
        \ proved more unfortunate than the first ; for he was not only defeated but\
        \ taken prisoner by Arsaces, in a great battle. The Parthians celebrated,\
        \ for many succeeding years, the anniversary of this victory, they considered\
        \ as the first day of their liberty, though in reality it was the first of\
        \ their slavery ; for the world never produced greater tyrants4 than those\
        \ Parthian kings to whom they were subjected. The Macedonian yoke, if they\
        \ had continued to submit to it, would have been much more supportable than\
        \ their oppressive government. Arsaces now be gan to assume the title of king,\
        \ and firmly esta blished this empire of the East, which, in pro cess of time,\
        \ counterpoised the Roman power, and became a barrier which all the armies\
        \ of that people were incapable of forcing. All the kings who succeeded Arsaces\
        \ made it an indis pensable law, and counted it an honour, to be called by\
        \ his name ; in the same manner as the Ptolemy, in the mean- A. M. 3765. time,\
        \ devoted the sweets of Ant. J. C. 239. peace to the cultivation of the sciences\
        \ in his domi nions, and the enlargement of his father's library at Alexandria\
        \ with all sorts of books: but as a proper collection could not well be made\
        \ without an able librarian, to whose care it would be likewise necessary\
        \ to consign them, Euergetes,1 upon the death of Zenodotus, who had held that\
        \ office from the time of Ptolemy Soter, the grandfather of that prince, sent\
        \ to Athens for Eratosthenes, the Cyrenean, who was then in great reputation,\
        \ and had been edu cated by Callimachus, a native of tbe same country. He\
        \ 2 was a man of universal learn ing; but none of his works have been trans\
        \ mitted to us, except his catalogue of the kings of Thebes in Egypt, with\
        \ the years of their re spective reigns, from Menes or Misraim, who first\
        \ peopled Egypt after the deluge, to the Tro jan war. This catalogue contains\
        \ a succession of thirty-eight kings, and is still to be seen in Syncellus.\
        \ When Seleucus saw him- 3 Justin. 1. xii. c. 4 & 5. 4 That the Parthian sovereigns\
        \ were greater tyrants than those who preceded them, is said without proof,\
        \ and to say that this victory began the slavery of those whom it freed from\
        \ the Macedonian yoke, is still greater ab surdity ; as if the people of the\
        \ East had never known slavery before. Whatever changes of dynasties have\
        \ taken place in the East, none have taken place in the government. Despotism\
        \ has always prevailed, and the fate ofthe people has been invariably the\
        \ same. A set of greater villains never filled a throne, than the Macedo nian\
        \ kings of Syria ; and their villany was generally asso ciated with imbecility.\
        \ If they had been possessed of talents, like Philip or Alexander, they might\
        \ perhaps have preserved their dominion. But, weak as well as wicked, it was\
        \ impossible they could preserve the domi nions acquired by Seleucus, the\
        \ first of the race ; and there is no probability in the assertion, that if\
        \ the people of the East had submitted to live peaceably under the Macedonian\
        \ sovereigns, that these would have proved better than their own. What ia\
        \ the history of these very Macedonian sove reigns, but that of a succession\
        \ of crimes, with hardly one redeeming virtue ? whereas, the Parthian sovereigns,\
        \ though despots, were generally a race of able monarchs compared with them.\
        \ If the Seleucides had been a race of able and enlightened princes, they\
        \ might have diffused the lights of literature, science, and art, over the\
        \ regions of the East, and dispelled the gloom of ignorance, with which it\
        \ has been perpetually covered. It was the most disgusting complication of\
        \ crimes, in the conduct of a Macedonian governor, that produced the revolt,\
        \ and they could not certainly change from better to worse in choos ing Arsaces\
        \ for their sovereign, in preference to the sway of a brutal deputy. We have\
        \ the facts before us, which preclude all hypothetical reasoning respecting\
        \ the future condition ofthe Orientals, if they had continued to live in subjection\
        \ to the Syro-Macedonian kings. The Macedo nian sovereigns of Bactria, ruled\
        \ eastern Persia for a cen tury after the revolt of the Parthians, but there\
        \ is not the smallest proof from history that the condition of the peo ple\
        \ in that region was materially benefited by the change, from a native to\

    - ["ALEXANDER'S SUCCESSORS. 303 Alexandria was undoubtedly indebted to this Mus\xE6\
        ura for the advantage she long enjoyed of being the greatest school in all\
        \ that part of the world, and of having trained up a vast number of men who\
        \ excelled in literature. It is from thence, in particular, that the Church\
        \ has re ceived some of its most illustrious doctors : as Clemens Alexandrinus,\
        \ Ammonius, Origen, soning, namely, that the ancient Egyptians were ignorant\
        \ of Greek, (that language not having been introduced into Egypt till the\
        \ era of the Ptolemies,) and, consequently, that had Serapis been an ancient\
        \ Egyptian god, his name could not have had a Greek etymon. It is very certain,\
        \ that if a king rose up in Egypt who knew not Joseph, as Moses tell us, that\
        \ Joseph could not have been worshipped as a deity ; and it is equally so,\
        \ that no person whose history was immediately connected with that nation,\
        \ in whose behalf so many tremendous judgments were inflicted on their gods,\
        \ their country, and them*. aelves, would ever be worshipped as a divinity\
        \ or undergo an apotheosis. If we are to credit the ancients, Serapis was\
        \ not origi- nally a native deity, nor worshipped by the ancient in- I habitants\
        \ of Egypt, as he must have been had the patriarch J Joseph been worshipped\
        \ under that name. Polybius, lib. i iv. p. 307. tells us that Serapis was\
        \ first worshipped as a ! god on the coast of the Propontis, on the Thracian\
        \ side, I over against Heirus, and that there Jason sacrificed to him, when\
        \ engaged in the Argonautic expedition. From thence, in all probability, the\
        \ worship of that deity was transferred to Sinope, itself a Greek colony,\
        \ and from Sinope brought into Egypt in the time and manner above related.\
        \ That he was a foreign deity is supported, inde- pendent of the authority\
        \ of Tacitus, by the suffrages of Origin, Clemens Alexandiinus, Plutarch,\
        \ in his treatise on Isis and Osiris, by the silence of Herodotus on the sub-\
        \ ject, and by the omission of the image of that god on the famous Isiac table.\
        \ The only objection against Herodotus and the Isiac table is, that all the\
        \ gods ot Egypt were not represented on that table, and that Herodotus did\
        \ not mention the names of all the Egyptian gods. But nega- tive objections\
        \ are no arguments of any weight against positive testimony ; and it is passing\
        \ strange, that if Sera- pis had been an ancient Egyptian deity, and worshipped\
        \ at the capital of Memphis too, that be cannot be recog- nized amongst the\
        \ gods anciently worshipped there, and that, in the absence of all history\
        \ concerning him, Vossius and his followers have been compelled to adopt a\
        \ Greek etymon for the name of a Coptic divinity, It is not true, also, as\
        \ has been said by Baumgarten, that as soon as the image of Serapis was landed\
        \ in Egypt the Egyptians immediately recognized him as their infer- nal Jupiter;\
        \ for Macrobius, in his Saturnalia, lib. j. c. 20. tells us, that Nicocreon,\
        \ who then reigned in Cyprus, sent to inquire at Alexandria what this god\
        \ Serapis was, which he would not have done had Serapis been anciently wor-\
        \ shipped by the natives, and Nicocreon, as the same au- thor informs us,\
        \ was a prince of great learning, and well- versed in the Egyptian mythology.\
        \ Origen speaks of him as a deity, brought into Egypt not long before fiis\
        \ time. For all these reasons it is manifest to me, at least, that Serapis\
        \ was a foreign deity, an imported god, and not one of ancient Egyptian manufacture.\
        \ However, his worship from the date of his importation soon outdid all the\
        \ hon- ours u>ually paid to Osiris, or almost all the other deities adored\
        \ in that land of pagan darkness, and, as if they de- lighted in darkness,\
        \ this Egyptian Pluto, this infernal deity, was elevated to a level in point\
        \ of adoration with the Thunderer of Olympus. The temple of this exotic deity,\
        \ who had succeeded to the bed and to the throne of Osiris, the husband of\
        \ Isis, and which rivalled the pride, and equalled the magni- ficence, of\
        \ the temple of the Capitoline Jupiter, was erected on the spacious summit\
        \ of an artificial mount, elevated one hundred steps above the adjacent level;\
        \ and the interior cavity was strongly supported by arches, and distributed\
        \ into vaults and labyrinths. The con- secrated buildings were surrounded\
        \ by a quadrangular portico. The stately halls, and exquisite statues, displayed\
        \ the triumph of the arts ; and the treasures of ancient learning were preserved\
        \ in the famous library \\i hich had succeeded that of the Bruchion. The colossal\
        \ statue of the god was composed of a great number of various me- tallic plates,\
        \ artificially conjoined, and so broad was its majestic figure, that it touched\
        \ on cither side the walls of the sanctuary. The aspect of Serapis, his sitting\
        \ posture, and the sceptre which he wielded in bis left hand, were extremely\
        \ similar to the representations of Jupiter. He was distinguished from that\
        \ deity by the basket, or bushel, which was placed on his head, and by the\
        \ emblematic monster which he grasped in his right hand; the head and body\
        \ of a serpent branching into three tails, which were again terminated by\
        \ the triple head of a dog, a liou, and a wolf. coop. Athen. lib. i. p. 22.\
        \ This museum, or college, of the literati was suppressed by the cruet and\
        \ tyrannical Caracalla, in A. D. 216, on account of some severe and satirical\
        \ lampoons which the Alexandrians had made upon him, on the occasion of the\
        \ death of his brother Geta. He also stripped the city of all its privileges,\
        \ after having previously ordered his troops to massacre the in. habitants\
        \ and pillage the place. Though Demetrius Phalereus was president of the mu\
        \ seum, we are not to imagine that he was Ptolemy's libra rian, as Aristeas\
        \ seemingly insinuates ; for this would have been too mean an employment for\
        \ a man who had been the prince of Athens, and had governed it ten years with\
        \ absolute sway, was a great lawgiver, on eminent philosopher, and the most\
        \ able politician of bis age. The emperor Antunine ranks him with the greatest\
        \ princes of those times, and even puts him on a level with Philip of Macedon,\
        \ and his son the Great Alexander. To say, therefore, that he was librarian\
        \ to Ptolemy, would be de grading a person of his merit and reputation. Another\
        \ person than he is found in this employment, under the reigns both of the\
        \ first Ptolemy and his successor Phila delphus, namely Zenodotus of Ephesus,\
        \ who, being pro fessionally a grammarian, was therefore a very fit person\
        \ to take charge of a library, and therefore there can be no doubt but that\
        \ he wuuld be assisted in his function by the advice of Demetrius himself,\
        \ the president of this new literary institution, as in the choice of valuable\
        \ books for the use of the literati who were to live in the museum. It must\
        \ be observed, th2t though the first library was in the quarter jf the Bruchion,\
        \ where stood the museum and the royal palace, yet, when the library was filled\
        \ to the number of 400,000 volumes, another library was erected within the\
        \ Serap\xE6um, as a supplement to it, and on that account was called the daughter\
        \ of the former. The books lodged in this gradually increased to 300,000 volumes,\
        \ and these two put together composed a total of 700,000 volumes, of which\
        \ the royal libraries of the Ptole mies were said to consist After the burning\
        \ of the Bru chion quarter with its library, that of the Serap\xE6um still\
        \ remained; and there it was, undoubtedly, that Cleopatra deposited the Pergamenian\
        \ collection of ii00,< 00 volumes which Antony gave her. The entire library\
        \ of the Sera p\xE6um, therefore, would contain 5U0,000 volumes ; and as there\
        \ can be little doubt but that this collection would re ceive various additions\
        \ in the lapse of four centuries, which succeeded, down to the fatal epoch\
        \ of its destruc tion by the archbishop Theophilus, it must have been a much\
        \ larger library than that consumed by the command of the khalif Omar, on\

        \ was, in honour of whom the temple was built \u2014 whether a foreign deity,\

        \ old forgotten deity worshipped at Memphis, and again raised to the honours\
        \ of godship \u2014 has been matter of keen dispute amongst the learned. Bochart\
        \ and Witsius are of opinion that Serapis was a foreign god, while Vossius,\
        \ De Idololat. lib. i c. 19. strives to support the strange notion of the\
        \ fathers, as Julius Firmicus, Ruffinus, &c. that the patriarch Joseph was\
        \ worshipped there under that name. This ridiculous and ill-grounded opinion\
        \ has also been embraced by Ouzelius, the learned Dr. Spencer, and many other\
        \ modem writers of no mean reputation. The only reason advanced for this strange\
        \ conceit is, that Serapis was generally represented with a bushel on his\
        \ head, which, they think, denotes the bushel with which Joseph measured out\
        \ his corn to the Egyp tians, in the time of the famine ; whereas, it may\
        \ as well represent the bushel with which Ptolemy measured out the same article\
        \ to the inhabitants of Sinope, which he sent them for their god. Vossius,\
        \ and those who follow his opinion, will have it also that Serapis was an\
        \ ancient Egyptian deity, the same with Apis, and derive his name from Apis\
        \ and the Greek word Soros, a coffin ; so that, according to them, Serapis\
        \ is the same as Apis en Soro, or Apis in his coffin. Their meaning is, that\
        \ tbe sacred bull, worshipped by the Egyptians, when alive was called Apis,\
        \ when dead, Serapis ; fur, from these words Apis and Soros, they deduce Serapis\
        \ ; which at first, according to them, was soroapts, and by corruption came\
        \ to be Serapis, and fir this they quote Nymphiodorus, Clemens Alexan drinus,\
        \ Ruffinus, and Eusebius. They seem, howerer*, not to have been aware of a\

        \ and were therefore guilty, not only of sacrilege, (which Brennus could not\
        \ be, as pro fessing a different faith,) but also of a breach of trust. When\
        \ Sylla besieged Athens, he was in great want of money to carry on his military\
        \ operations. He had re course, therefore, to the sacred and inviolable treasures\
        \ of the Greek temples ; and wrote a letter to the Amphic tyons assembled\
        \ at Delphi, desiring them to send him the treasures of the god, promising\
        \ most solemnly that he would return to Apollo, whom he himself revered, Ihe\
        \ value of whatever should be sent him. One Caphis, a Phocian warrior, and\
        \ his confident, was deputed to de liver this letter to tbe Amphictyons, and\
        \ excuse, to the assembly, the step which Sylla was forced to take. When arrived\
        \ at Delphi, Caphis wept in presence of the Am phictyons, and told them the\
        \ mournful message, and which nothing short of the greatest distress could\
        \ have induced Sylla to send. The oracle, indeed, made no reply ; but the\
        \ sound of the lyre of Apollo was heard from the interior of the sanctuary;\
        \ and Caphis, whether he was really terrified at the pretended prodigy, or\
        \ willing to save the treasure by filling Sylla with religious fear, would\
        \ not meddle with the consecrated wealth of the god till he had told Sylla\
        \ what had happened. But Sylla was not a man to be touched with religious\
        \ scruples, or filled with religious fear ; money was what he wanted ; and\
        \ whether it were private or public property\u2014 whether it belonged to\
        \ a man or to a god \u2014 gave him little concern, provided he got it. But,\
        \ knowing the superstition of the Phocian, he told him that he was surprised\
        \ that he should not comprehend that music was a sign of joy, and not at all\
        \ that of anger or resentment ; and therefore desired him to take the treasures,\
        \ as, in doing so, he was acting agreeably to the will of the god. Pursuant\
        \ to this order, all the gold, silver, and brass ; all the vases, presents,\
        \ and offerings ; which the superstition of the most distant, as well as neighbouring\
        \ nations, had brought or sent hither, were loaded on carts, and, amidst tbe\
        \ lamentations and outcries of the Amphictyons and Delphians, sent to the\
        \ Roman camp, where the gold, silver, and brass, were coined by Sylla's orders.\
        \ The person employed by him to superintend the coinage was Lucullus, one\
        \ of the qu\xE6s tors, who made so beautiful a coin that it was ever after\
        \ highly valued, and known by the name of the Lucullian money. The treasures\
        \ of the god \xC6sculapius, at Epidau rus, not much inferior in value to those\
        \ of the Del phian god, were at the same time, by Sylla's orders, brought\
        \ to the camp, and, by his qu\xE6stor, turned into money. What says our blessed\
        \ Lord respecting the objects of these remarkable calamities? \"Do ye think\
        \ they were sinners above all men who dwell at Jerusalem ? Nay; but except\
        \ ye repent ye shall all likewise perish.\" Our Lord does not deny that they\
        \ were sinners, but he says they were not greater sinners than others. These\
        \ facts and sayings, adduced from scripture, ought to make us aware of the\
        \ impropriety of determining upon the conduct of persons, from God's external\
        \ conduct to them, as if the dispensations of providence were a sure criterion\
        \ of the moral character of individuals and so cieties. The error is common,\
        \ both amongst those who profess a high regard to religion and to those who\
        \ are comparatively indifferent concerning it. Yet, after all, the wonderful\
        \ story is vouched by the sole contemporary authority of the poet Callimachus,\
        \ a votary of the Delian god, (Hymn in Delum, v. 171, &c.) to which may be\
        \ added his Scholiast, but who was not contemporaneous with the event. The\
        \ other authorities, as those of Justin, (1. xxiv. c. 8. 1. xxxii. c. 3.)\
        \ Cicero, (De Divinat. 1. i. c. 37.) Livy, (I. xl. c. 58 ) Propertius, (1.\
        \ iii. 33. v. 53.) and Pausanias, (I. x. p. 632,653.) all rest on this ; three\
        \ of whom lived about 250 years posterior to the event, and Justin and Pausanias\
        \ upwards of four centu ries after it: and as Gibbon himself lays a mighty\
        \ stress on the want of sufficient evidence in any thing in which our common\
        \ faith is concerned, so may we where Pagan ism is concerned. This same Callimachus,\
        \ on whose authority so much stress has been laid, was librarian to Ptolemy\
        \ Philadel phus and Ptolemy Evergetes ; to flatter which latter prince, for\
        \ the loss of his wife Berenice's hair, he, in con junction with Conon the\
        \ astronomer, affirmed that her hair was taken up to heaven, and that the\
        \ seven stars near the tail of the lion, which till then, as it were by good\
        \ luck, hail not belonged to any constellation, were her hair ; and wrote\
        \ a poem on set purpose to celebrate this new and hitherto unheard of apotheosis.\
        \ Now, the whole etory of the miracle at Delphi, as related by him, may have\
        \ as little foundation for its truth as his poem on Berenice's hair. Polybius,\
        \ indeed, who is farther from being a credulous or superstitious writer than\
        \ most of his day, reckons this deliverance of Greece from the Gauls to have\
        \ been very extraordinary, though he mentions none of the particulars, because\
        \ he only touched upon it en passant, as Athen\xE6us has done. Hist. lib.\
        \ ii. p. 171. and Deipnos, lib. vi. p. 234. But still he lived a century and\
        \ a half posterior to that event, not cotemporary with it. But still, though\
        \ we should grant the story to be true, it was not miraculous, as we have\
        \ shown in a former part of this note. Sylla, thus furnished with money, was\
        \ enabled to pay his men, and all the other necessary \"expenses attending\
        \ the siege of Athens. Now, what sort of god, or gods, were these, who could\
        \ not protect their own property? Why was not a providential interposition\
        \ made in behalf of the Delphian temple, against Sylla, as well as against\
        \ the Gauls? Was not the crime of Sylla much greater than that of Brennus\
        \ ? Did not Sylla, equally with the Greeks, believe in the divinity of the\
        \ Delphian Apollo? and was not his godship most scurvily used, and rascally\
        \ treated by his professed votary, who, as if on set purpose to insult the\
        \ professed object of his religious homage, pre tended his godship's leave\
        \ to strip him of all his property, and made use of that very property to\
        \ deprive his pro fessed votaries of their political freedom ? If we were\
        \ disposed to moralize, ]ike our author, we might say, that it was a just\
        \ punishment on the infatuated votaries of the Delphian god, that all the\
        \ treasure which for rges had been accumulated there, as proofs of the gratitude\
        \ and veneration of the worshippers, were, in the course of events, seized\
        \ and taken by a foreign general, and em ployed for the very purpose of reducing\
        \ the Greeks under the Roman yoke. In the year 66, the emperor Nero, having\
        \ consulted the Pythoness of Delphi, was by her reviled as an Orestes and\
        \ an Alcm\xE6on, (parricides who had murdered their respec tive mothers, as\
        \ we are told by Lucian of Samcsata, The. mistius the orator, and Julian the\
        \ apostate,) and that she never condescended to give him any further communica\
        \ tions. Provoked at this contemptuous and contumelious treatment, the tyrant\
        \ caused all the issues from the temple to be shut up; commanded several persons\
        \ to be mur dered in it in order tbat it might be profaned ; stripped Apollo,\
        \ or rather, his priests, of the lands he possessed at Cirrha, in the vicinity\
        \ of Delphi ; and carried away with These writers were declared enemies to\
        \ the Gauls, and could exaggerate the story at their pleasure ; for who was\
        \ to contradict them at 200 or iOO years after the event had happened ? Cicero\
        \ and Justin accuse them of having plun dered the treasures of Delphi, though\
        \ others say that this was not accomplished ; and Cicero tells us that they\
        \ car ried it home too, but, being grievously plagued for their sacrilege,\
        \ they were advised to throw their ill gotten spoil into the lake of Thoulouse.\
        \ The natural course, one would think, would have been to send it back to\
        \ the tem ple of that deity, whose wrath they had felt, in like manner as\
        \ the Philistines were compelled to send home tl e ark. But the story is a\
        \ complete fiction of Cicero. The trea sure which was consecrated and deposited\
        \ in Thoulouse, was not fetched from Delphi t.t all, but was dug from some\
        \ rich mines in the vicinity ; as Strabo and Athefi\xE6us inform us, from\
        \ the authority of Posidonius. It was this immense treasure, consisting of\
        \ 100,000 Ibs. of gold, and as many of silver, which the proconsul, the infamous\
        \ C\u0153pio, took out of Thoulouse. Now, if this story of Cicero, and of\
        \ Justin who copies it, be a notorious fiction, what ground have we to believe\
        \ in the pretended miraculous stoim of thunder, lightning, and hail, and the\
        \ fall of rocks? The temple of Delphi had been plundered before, not only\
        \ by Xerxes hut by the Phocians themselves, in whose territory Delphi lay\
        \ ; and the amount of the plunder was estimated at 10,000 talents. Now, the\
        \ crime of the Phocians was greater than that of", 1]

        \ where they remained almost a hundred and thirty years ; till the heirs of\
        \ Neleus's family, who after several generations were fallen into extreme\
        \ poverty, brought them out to sell to ApelHcon, a rich Athenian, who sought\
        \ every where after the most curious books for his library. As they were very\
        \ much da maged by the length of time, and the damp place where they had lain,\
        \ Apellicon had copies immediately taken of them, in which there were many\
        \ chasms; because the originals were either rotted in many places, or worm-eaten\
        \ and obliterated. These blanks, words, and let ters, were filled up as well\
        \ as they could be by conjecture, and that in some places with suffi cient\
        \ want of judgment. From hence arose the many difficulties in those works\
        \ which have ever since exercised the learned world. Apel licon being dead\
        \ some short time before Sylla's arrival at Athens, he seized upon his library,\
        \ and with these works of Aristotle, which he found in it, enriched his own\
        \ at Rome. A famous grammarian of those times, named Tyrannion, who lived\
        \ then at Rome, having a great desire for these works of Aristotle, ob tained\
        \ permission from Sylla's librarian to take a copy of them. That copy was\
        \ communicated to Andronicus the Rhodian, who afterwards imparted it to the\
        \ public, and to him the world is obliged for the works of that great philoso\
        \ pher. the slightest distrust. As for the inhabitants of the Bosphorus, he\
        \ prepared a great fleet and a numerous army, which gave reason to believe\
        \ his designs were against the Romans. And, in fact, he had not restored all\
        \ Cappadocia to Ario barzanes, but reserved part of it in his own hands ;\
        \ and he began to suspect Archelaus, as having engaged him in a peace equally\
        \ shameful and disadvantageous. When Archelaus perceived it, well knowing\
        \ the master he had to deal with, he took refuge with Murena, and solicited\
        \ him warmly to turn his arms against Mithridates. Murena, who passionately\
        \ desired to obtain the honour of a triumph, suffered himself to be easily\
        \ per suaded. He made an irruption into Cappado cia, and made himself master\
        \ of Comana, the most powerful city of that kingdom. Mithri dates sent ambassadors\
        \ to him, to complain of his violating the treaty the Romans bad made with\
        \ him. Murena replied, that he knew of no treaty made with their master. There\
        \ was in reality nothing reduced to writing on Sylla's part, the whole having\
        \ passed by verbal agree ment. In consequence, he continued to ravage his\
        \ country, and took up his winter-quarters in it. Mithridates sent ambassadors\
        \ to Rome, to make his complaints to Sylla and the senate. There came a commis-\
        \ A. M. 3922. sionerfrom Rome, but with- Ant. J. C. 82. out a decree of the\
        \ senate, who publicly ordered Mu rena not to molest the king of Pontus. But,\
        \ as they conferred together in private, this was looked upon as a mere collusion\
        \ ; and indeed Murena persisted in ravaging his country. Mithridates therefore\
        \ took the field, and, hav ing passed the river Halys, gave Murena battle.\
        \ defeated him, and obliged him to retire into Phrygia with very great loss.\
        \ Sylla, who had been ap- A. M. 3923. pointed dictator, not being Ant. J.\
        \ C. 81. able to suffer any longer that Mithridates, contrary to the treaty\
        \ he had granted him, should be molested, sent Gabinius to Murena to order\
        \ him in ear nest to desist from making war with that prince, and to reconcile\
        \ him with Ariobarzanes. He obeyed. Mithridates having put one of his sons,\
        \ only four years old, into the hands of Ariobarzanes, as a hostage, under\
        \ that pretext retained the cities in which he had garrisons, promising no\
        \ doubt to restore them in time. He then gave a great feast, in which he pro\
        \ mised prizes for such as should excel the rest in drinking, eating, singing,\
        \ and rallying: fit objects of emulation ! Gabinius was the only one who did\
        \ not think proper to enter these lists. Thus ended the second war with Mith\

        \ the honour of a triumph, to which he had no great claim. Mithridates at\

        \ being compelled so to do by Sylla, who died the same year. But he contrived\
        \ a stratagem to deprive him entirely of it. Tigranes had lately built a great\
        \ city in Armenia, which, from his own name, he called Tigranocerta. Mithri\

        is only partly correct: the love of books, which formed the passion of the
        two learned scholars, whom Hume notices, fortunately intervened to save the
        royal collec tion from the intended scattering ; but the pic tures and medals
        were, perhaps, objects too slight in the eyes of the book-learned ; they were
        resigned to the singular fate of appraise ment. After the restoration, very
        many books were missing ; but scarcely a third part of the medals remained
        : of the strange manner in which these precious remains of ancient art and

        Sometimes, indeed, a written agreement is entered into by the parties concerning
        their future mode of life when married ; the husband, for instance, promising
        never to take his wife out of Rome for the purpose of going to live in the
        country, which in Italy is deemed a pro digious hardship. The multitude of
        independent native princes who became feudatories of the Pope, and of those
        foreign princes among whom Italy was successively parcelled out, all formerly
        made a point of preserving in their domestic establishment as much as they
        could of their abdicated state ; and even at this day some of the Ro- man
        princes and dukes, reduced in their circumstances as they have been by the
        revolution, retain, as master of ceremonies, a noble still poorer than themselves
        ; a lawyer to assist in the dispensation of civil justice to their feudal
        tenants no longer in existence ; another for the criminal department ; a secretary,
        a librarian, a steward, and several accountants, besides a train of menial
        servants. Formerly a prince and princess, a duke and duchess, had each their
        separate establish- ment ; different liveries for their servants, and carriages
        with distinct armorial bearings. Some of these ladies of high rank were always
        attended by their gentlemen, who formed a part of the household, yet was nobly
        born. Many people at Rome remember Princess Braschi, for instance, handed
        in and out of a drawing-room by her gentleman ; while the prince her husband,
        if he hap pened to be there at the same time, followed, but never offered
        his arm to her. Cardinals need not be priests, and may leave the church and

        \ to the unloading of my baggage. I remained there a few hours, as 1 found\
        \ it cooler on board than on shore. The vessel was as they said, full of visitors\
        \ all day, for Captain Ryk, with his usual libe rality, denied access to no\
        \ one of genteel appearance. Citizens are by no means allowed to visit American\
        \ vessels of war, unless they are known to an officer, and on this account\
        \ the curiosity of the inhabitants of this place to see a foreign vessel of\
        \ war is great. When I returned to the city, I visited Mr. Quincy, who took\
        \ me to the Court-house to see the arsenal of the thirteen volunteer companies\
        \ of this place. One of these companies has been orga nized ever since 1638;\
        \ all of these consist of young men of good families, who do not wish to serve\
        \ in the same companies with the common crowd, but have united, and, in elegant\
        \ uniforms, compose the flank companies of the battalions of militia. A large\
        \ hall in the Court-house is appropriated for their exercises, when the weather\
        \ is inclement. Every company consists of about sixty men. The greater number\
        \ of the companies are armed like in fantry, with bayonets according to the\
        \ English mode, and the ri flemen alone with rifles. Not only the arms of\
        \ the company, but the swords of the officers are kept in the chambers of\
        \ the Court house. From the Court-house, Mr. Quincy took me to the Athen\xE6\
        um, where the principal journals of the United States are found, and a library\
        \ of about twenty thousand volumes, which were partly presented and partly\
        \ purchased. A regular librarian showed us every thing; we noticed particularly\
        \ several interesting medals, and the collection made by Thomasson in Birmingham,\
        \ which represents the Elgin marbles. In the vestibule of the house, and in\
        \ the large reading room, are plaster busts, which Lawyer Thorn dike brought\
        \ from Rome and presented to the Athen\xE6um. The handsome house itself, which\

        \ the right to take books home with them; the library contains likewise a\
        \ large collection of copperplates, and amongst others a handsome edition\
        \ of Hogarth's prints. The library is arranged in two great halls, and as\
        \ a curiosity they show Dr. Franklin's library chair. The statue of this famous\
        \ man stands in a niche over the entrance of the house, and was presented,\
        \ as the inscription says, by Mr. Bingham, the merito rious father of Mr.\
        \ Bingham of Montreal. After that we went to the Philosophical Society, which\
        \ also owns a building, and possesses a rich library and cabinet. * The librarian,\
        \ Mr. John Vaughan, a venerable gentleman, equally esteemed for his bene volence\
        \ and urbanity, performed the honours. He showed us the handwriting of several\
        \ celebrated individuals of the revolu tion. The cabinet contains, amongst\
        \ other things, a mineralogical cabinet, a collection of shells, &c. Finally,\
        \ we went to the State House, and saw the plain and not very large hall in\

        \ and Hierozoicon, is to be found in that published by the learned John Leusden,\
        \ of the works of Bochart, in 1700, in 2 vols. folio. Briet was a Jesuit,\
        \ and librarian of the uni versity of Paris. In 1648, he published his Parallels\
        \ of Ancient and Modern Geography, but the work is incomplete, as it went\

        \ is made of different stades at different times, and in different places,\
        \ nor between road and horizontal distance. He gives the ancient divisions\
        \ of the various countries of Europe, down to the time of Constantine, -with\
        \ the modern divisions and nomenclature, hut still there is no illustration\
        \ of the physical part of geography attempted \u2014 no detail of rivers and\
        \ mountains is given, and nothing is mentioned in the subdivision of provinces\
        \ but the names of places. Valesius and Sanson gave the notitia of ancient\
        \ Gaul, Palmerius illustrated great part of the ancient geography of Greece.\
        \ No writer, how ever, of eminence, had vet completed a survey of the ancient\
        \ world. This arduous work was reserved for, and accomplished by Christopher\
        \ Cellarius, who performed it with fidelity and exactness, in A. D. 1703,\
        \ in 2 vols. 4to, entitled Notitia Orbis Antiqui. All the passages in ancient\
        \ authors that respect the subject are quoted, after the example of Cluvier.\
        \ But as the plan descends no lower than the time of Constantine, the geography\
        \ of the middle and lower ages are wanting. An epitome of the work has been\
        \ published by Bishop Patrick. The fame of Cellarius as an enlightened and\
        \ faithful guide in ancient geography continued till the time of D'Anville,\
        \ whose superior repu tation both in ancient as well as modern geo graphy\
        \ so completely outshone it, that his work is almost no longer consulted.\
        \ As Rollin observes, Sanson was deemed an eminent geographer in his day,\
        \ and his maps were highly esteemed. But they were far from being accurate,\
        \ as he was not furnished with a competent number of observations, nor suffi\
        \ ciently profound in his researches. He copied some of Ptolemy's errors,\
        \ and committed more of his own. Fie was too hasty in bis compositions, and\
        \ too careless in correcting what he had pub lished The source of the Nile\
        \ is fixed south of the equator ; and the Mediterranean Sea, with the regions\
        \ adjacent, are extended beyond their true dimensions. India, Tartary, and\
        \ China are very incorrectly delineated. The labours of Sanson terminated\
        \ with his life, in 1667, but he left two sons, who inherited his fame, and\
        \ published several geographical productions. Other geogra phical works successively\
        \ appeared, as the Atlas of Father Scherer, in 1696 ; the Geographical Dictionary\
        \ of Corneille, in 1708 ; that o De Varea, in 1713, in two vols. toho ; and\
        \ the Great Geographical and Critical Dictionary of Martinierefin 10 vols.\

        \ Moll, in Holland; and Wittsens Geographical Account of the Northern and\
        \ Eastern parts of Europe and Asia, with a large map of these regions, and\
        \ those of Hauber, Hubner Stats, Zritung, and Ebeling. But they are all mere\
        \ compilations, executed with labour, and may more properly be denominated\
        \ meagre, ill digested histories of the world, interspersed with a few patches\
        \ of real geographical informa tion by the way, too bulky tor common use,\
        \ and quite incompetent to give satisfactory informa tion on subjects of mathematical\
        \ and physical geography to men of science and information. Though Mercator\
        \ may be called the father of geographical science, yet, strictly speaking,\
        \ mathematical geography, even though its prin ciples were well understood\
        \ and illustrated by Varinius and Riccioli, was not studied with the attention\
        \ it deserved and required, till the com mencement of the 18th century ; and\
        \ till that period no maps hitherto constructed could be said to be at all\
        \ accurate. The obvious causes were, want of observations, deficiency of mate\
        \ rials, imperfection of instruments, and the imper fect state of astronomical\
        \ science. If the posi tions of all the principal places were founded on astronomical\
        \ observations, and if the interme diate distances were geometrically ascertained,\
        \ an exact map could be easily constructed. But if these are wanting, no learning,\
        \ however great, no industry, however unremitting, can com pensate the defect.\
        \ The longitudes during this long period were not at all accurately fixed.\
        \ Observers of latitudes were but few, and were for the greater part stationed\
        \ in the principal cities of Europe. The positions of many towns, the courses\
        \ of rivers, aud the forms of sea-coasts, were but very vaguely ascertained,\
        \ by the rude estimates of travellers, the imperfect computa tions of journalists,\
        \ and the incorrect observa tions of navigators. By the aid of itinerary measures,\
        \ such as those of the Roman roads, the ancients estimated the distances of\
        \ places with some degree of precision ; but modern measures. being more various,\
        \ and differing widely from each other, have not, and could not obtain an\
        \ equal degree of precision. The Roman roads were much better than the modern,\
        \ in respect of durability and straightness, especially in Italy and Gaul,\
        \ and consequently gave the ancient geographers advantages which the modern\
        \ geo graphers wanted. But in the 18th century, these defects began to be\
        \ removed. The most essen tial improvements originated in France. Societies\
        \ were formed, voyages were undertaken by order of the sovereign, Louis XIV.,\
        \ accurate obser vations and surveys were made, the result of which was an\
        \ almost geometrical knowledge of many parts of the globe. The labours of\
        \ Picard, La Hire, Cassini, Maupertuis, Bouguer, aud Condamine, paved the\
        \ way for a more exact geography than the world had yet seen. _he discovery\
        \ of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, and their utility for fixing\
        \ longitudes with precision, belongs to the elder Cassini. In consequence\
        \ of this, the longitude of the Medi terranean was shorn of that enormous\
        \ length which Ptolemy and almost all succeeding geo graphers had assigned\
        \ it. In 1694, geography was also materially improved in consequence of the\
        \ famous controversy between Newton, and Cassini, and Huvgens, respecting\
        \ the sphericity of the globe, whether it was a prolate or oblate spheroid,\
        \ which controversy was continued till near the middle of the last century,\
        \ by the mathematicians and natural philosophers of the Continent and England.\

        \ hundred years before Christ, had composed works of this kind, as we have\
        \ observed above. The Romans, having made themselves masters of the world,\
        \ and united the East and West under the same power, it is not to be doubted,\
        \ but geography must have derived great advan tages from it. It is easy to\
        \ perceive, that most of the completest geographical works were com piled\
        \ during the Roman emperors. The great roads of the empire measured in all\
        \ their extent, might have contributed much to the improve ment of geography\
        \ ; and the Roman Itineraries, though often altered and ineorrect, are still\
        \ of great service in composing some maps, and in the inquiries necessary\
        \ to the knowledge of the ancient geography. Antoninus* $ Itinerary, as it\
        \ is commonly called, because supposed to have been compiled in his reign,\
        \ is ascribed by the learned to the cosmographer \xC6thicus. We have also\
        \ a kind of Table or oblong Map, which is called the Theodosian Table, from\
        \ its being conjectured to have been composed about the time of Theodosius.\
        \ The name of Peutinger is also given to this table, which is that of a con\
        \ siderable citizen of Augsburg in Germany, in whose library it was found,\
        \ and whence it was sent to the famous Ortelius, the greatest gcogra* pher\
        \ of his time. Alexander's expedition, who extended his con quests as far\
        \ as the frontiers of Scythia, and into India, opened to the Greeks a positive\
        \ know ledge of many countries very remote from their own. That conqueror\
        \ had two engineers, Diognetus and B\xE6ton, in his service, who were ordered\
        \ to measure his marches. Pliny and Strabo4 have preserved those measures;\

        windows on the sides of the building : the east end is a circular blank wall
        ; at the west end is the only entrance, under a handsome stone tower, which
        tower is only attached to the west end of the structure, the other three sides
        being quite free from the body, which is crowned by a light cupola, supported
        by pillars and arches. The interior is extremely plain, and has been condemned
        as a bad specimen of modern Greek architecture. At the east end is an arch
        ornamented with stucco, beyond which is a picture of Ananias restoring St.
        Paul to sight. This painting is a copy of an ancient master, (Cortona,) by
        Nathaniel Dance, esq. president of the Royal Academy, brother of the architect,
        and presented to the church by that gentleman. There are no monuments particularly
        deserving attention, except a bust of Mr. Joseph Patience, architect, who
        seems " Patience on a monument smiling at Dance;" for in very truth he appears
        astonished at the architecture around him, which, Medusa-like, seems to have
        ossified his countenance. Perhaps, the sculptor was an unsuccessful candidate
        for some ornamental work in the church, and carved this effigy to commemorate
        his anger and contempt. The monuments were destroyed with the old church,
        except two, which are mentioned by Strype. A portion of the old London-wall
        is yet to be seen in the western wall of the churcli. Amongst the relics mentioned
        by Malcolm, are " a bone of Saynt Davy, clossed in silver." Amongst its rectors,
        the most eminent was William Beloe, a poet, better known as the translator
        of Herodotus and Aulus Gellius, and a librarian of the British Museum. Here
        was formerly the residence of an anchorite, for it is recorded in the parochial
        annals, that the " ankers" were benefactors to the church, Mr. Malcolm supposes
        that his dwelling might be formed under the city wall, between this church
        and St. Mary Axe ; for from several circumstances it may be inferred, that
        gardens and open spaces, rather than houses, faced the inner surface of the

        the cause of science, the King had assigned a sum of fifteen thousand rixthalers
        for the purpose of filling up several lacuna which existed among thedifferent
        collections of books; and that he had also added a sum of three hundred rix-
        thalers to the already existing annual revenue of the Royal Library, and had
        increased the salaries of the librarians. Dining one day with Monsieur D''Alopeus,
        the Russian ambassador, I sat by the side of the minister of the King of Saxony,
        whose conversation, principally on subjects con nected with the fine arts,
        gave me some notion of the state of painting in Prussia, and of the different
        collections of pictures in the capital. The only one which I visited, and
        which in point of importance may be considered as the first, is that in the
        Royal Palace. This may be said to con tain the best and only specimens of
        Italian masters to be found in Berlin ; but amongst them there are some of

        \ University has already been productive of much good to the town, and is\
        \ well frequented. The number of students amounts already to upwards of five\
        \ hundred. There are twenty-nine gratuitous presen tations of two hundred\

        for the good effects of that friendly disposition which I experi enced during
        my short stay at St. Petersburgh. The room in question is part of the Palace

        palaces which I have endeavoured to describe. Until within the last two years,
        the superb collection of antiques and cameos, contained in the Hermitage,
        was displayed in some of the rooms on the first floor. They have since been
        transferred to an extensive suite of rooms on a lower floor, where several
        cabinets, disposed with great taste, and richly fitted up, serve to exhibit
        this valuable and extensive museum. Antique as well as modern statues, groups,
        bronzes, and other objects of virtu, are profusely distributed around and
        in the centre of the arched and well-lighted saloons, forming an ensemble
        worthy of the reputation of a Louvre. The museum is under the chief superintendence
        of the Conseiller Koehler, who is likewise librarian for the foreign department
        of the Library of the Hermitage. Monsieur Koehler is a profound and learned

        Berlin, who stand high for cha racter and learning, are members of this society,
        which holds its meetings at the house of the president every fort night, throughout
        the year. The Journal of Medicine, edit ed by Hiifeland, gives an account
        of its sittings, and of the papers read, and discussions which take place
        in the course of them. The meetings begin at five and end at seven o''clock

        seems strongly prevalent throughout that part of Germany which I have visited.

        from the French Repertoire, the number is considerable ; but the most able
        amongst them are Labanov, Gnieditch, Gendre, Katenine, ancl Prince Chakhovsky
        himself. It may be stated, in conclusion, that in literature, the Russians
        have made more rapid progress within the last fifty years, than in the other
        branches of knowledge which they, however, cultivate with no small degree
        of ardour. According to M. Sopikoff, who published an Essay on Russian Bibliography,
        in five volumes, it appears, that al though the art of printing was introduced
        in Russia one hundred and fifteen years after its invention, and eighty years
        after its introduction by Caxton in England, not fewer than 80,000 volumes,
        in the Slavonic Russian lan guages, have been published between 1551 and 1813
        ; and from the information I obtained at the different booksellers at St.
        Petersburgh, as well as from an examination of cata logues of works printed
        since the last mentioned period, that number may be looked upon as having
        been nearly dou bled since. In point of typography, St. Petersburgh has no
        reason to envy other nations. The printers in that city produce works executed
        in a much superior style to the Germans, equally as good as the French, and
        only inferior, as are all other nations, except the Italians, to the English.
        Periodical literature, including newspapers, cannot be said to have flourished
        at any period in St. Petersburgh. Some exceptions ought perhaps to be made
        in favour of the present time, when a few really excellent publications of
        that kind are conducted with great spirit, and are, I un derstood, greatly
        encouraged by the superior and middle classes of society. Although it is not
        my intention to enu merate the writers who have distinguished themselves in
        this branch of literature, I cannot omit stating, that M. Greitsch, one of

        she had obtained possession, at the parti tion of Poland, of a collection
        of books, which she re moved from Warsaw, to which capital it belonged. That
        library had been originally formed by the family of the Counts ZaulQtsky,
        by whom it was bequeathed to the State. After their death, it received no
        addition from the Polish Government, so that most of the important works pub
        lished since 1770 are altogether wanting. As the Counts Zaulotsky were in
        the Church, the largest part of their li brary was that which refers to theological
        and ascetic works. It occupies, in the present edifice, the whole of the upper
        galleries, which are very extensive. The Imperial Library, in its present
        state, was only made public in 1814, by the late Emperor ; who could not fail
        to remark, while abroad, the many advantages arising to the people from such
        establishments. The Library is open to the public, without any distinc tion,
        on Tuesdays, from eleven till three o''clock ; and every Wednesday. Thursday,
        and Friday, from ten in the morn ing till nine in the evening in the summer,
        and till sunset in the winter. Every visitor must first get a billet dAentree
        from one of the librarians, in the ante-room on the ground floor, who inscribes
        the name of such visitor in a register. Any number of books may be obtained,
        particularly works of re ference, which are taken into the reading-room, on
        the same floor. This apartment is large, and its arched roof is sup ported
        by pilasters. Beyond it are two smaller rooms, con taining all the Russian
        works published from the earliest pe riod of Russian typography, on subjects
        of every description, to the number of 15,000. The librarian who has in charge

        And the audience actually took place in the Cabinet of Natural History. The
        collections themselves were no less objects of admi ration to Peter''s officers
        and counsellors. He was one day, (whilst engaged in examining those collections)
        expatiating to his Attorney-general, Paul Ivanovitch Jagouchinsky, and other
        senators and great lords of his court, on the plea sure as well as the utility
        of science, when turning to the librarian Schoumacher, he bade him, from that
        time forward, freely admit all classes of persons to the Museum, taking care
        to have proper assistants to show and explain to the visitors every object
        they wished to examine. The man of law having an eye to the expense which
        the state would incur by an establishment of this nature, suggested that the
        visitor ought to pay one or two roubles for his admis sion. " Paul Ivanovitch,"
        was the answer of the Sovereign, " who would take the trouble to come and
        admire my exo tics, if I exhibited them for money ? No, no ; my intention
        is, that they should not only be shown gratuitously to all, but also that
        whenever a party of people come on purpose to visit these cabinets, a cup
        of coffee, or a glass of wine, or some other refreshment shall be offered
        to them at my ex pense." The latter practice was continued until the death
        of the Empress Anne. Peter had a firm conviction that the mere contemplation
        of the various objects of science, and still more so the study of them, would
        tend to advance his great work of reform and amelioration among his subjects
        more than any other means he could devise ; he therefore never lost sight
        of his favourite object ; and when he fell ill of the com plaint which ultimately
        put an end to his existence, among other charges, and with his dying breath,
        he recommended to the Empress Catherine Alexievna, who was to succeed', 1]

        ofthe late Emperor to create one for that purpose. All the old revolutionary,
        and most of the modern political works, are excluded. In regard to religious
        works the thing is quite different, and the greatest latitude is allowed for
        the admission of books upon every creed. Before the Em peror Alexander made
        this library public, there was actu ally no National Establishment of the
        kind in St. Peters burgh ; for although the Academy- of Sciences has a very
        extensive and valuable library, and, as we have seen, a larger and more choice
        collection of books is to be found at the Hermitage; yet these could no more
        be considered in the light of public libraries than those belonging to the
        convent of St. Alexander Nevskoi, to the Land Cadet Corps, to the Mine Corps,
        or to private individuals, however liberally the latter may have acted in
        permitting the studious to have access to their collections. As yet, the attendance
        of the public to the library is not very numerous, seldom exceeding a hundred,
        or a hundred and twenty in a week, notwithstanding the many faci lities afforded
        them ; but the Institution is too much in its infant state to expect more,
        and will admit of consi derable improvements. The mode in which the books
        are classed is advantageous; but neither their arrangement nor the binding
        is worthy of an Imperial Library, or of such a magnificent City as St. Petersburgh.
        I have rea son, however, to know that it is the intention of the reigning
        Emperor to enlarge and embellish this Establish ment, as part of a vast project
        of improvements in this part of the town, which has been confided to the eminent
        architect, Monsieur Rossi. The attendants on the librarians and the readers,
        who fetch and return the books, are veteran soldiers, dressed in their military

        had hitherto been illustrious and enduring. Indeed, the prosperity which this
        little kingdom of Gra- nada enjoyed under the dominion of the Moors, has rarely
        been surpassed by the most flourishing states of modern or of ancient times
        ; and the whole story of its downfall at the moment of its greatest power,
        and without any prelude of that decay which usually annoimces the overthrow
        of states, is one of the most touching that the pen of history has ever traced.
        The story of the Moorish, or rather Saracenic dom- ination in Spain, as compiled
        from Arabic manuscripts by the Jeromite monk and librarian of the Escurial,
        Jose An- toiio Conde, is full of the most romantic incident ; while the later
        events which closed the struggle by that ten years war which terminated with
        the triumphal entry of Ferdi- nand and Isabella into the proud capital of
        this heroic king- dom, have been related with a gorgeous and poetic richness
        of description which, in abating nothing of the fidelity of history, yet serves
        to fill the mind with a series of brilliant pictures that recall the creations
        of Homer, and half per- suade the reader that he is poring over another Iliad,
        with a theme no less noble than the first. The " Conquest of Granada" has
        been neither appreciated nor understood. It contains the most faithful record
        extant of that romantic war, which is not embellished, like the civil wars
        of Gra- nada, of Perez de la Gita, from the creations of a sickly im- agination,
        but from abundant and varied research, and inti- mate acquaintance with the
        feelings and manners of the age. Hence the " Conquest of Granada," in becoming
        poet ical, does not cease to be true, containing, as it does, no fact unsubstantiated
        by historians and chroniclers. Though this victory of Ferdinand and Isabella
        was a Christian triumph, in name at least, it was not a triumph of humanity

        of Raphael. One is called Our Lady of the Fish, or simply the Fish, from a
        well-drawn fish that figures in it ; another the Visitation, in which the
        Virgin, appearing in the pres ence of Elizabeth, exhibits the utmost embarrassment.
        The last is called the Pearl, a famous painting, formerly owned by the kings
        of England, but which was sold either by Cromwell or by Charles II. for two
        thousand pounds ster ling. It is now esteemed above all price. The subject
        is the Holy Family, and the whole piece is allowed by paint ers to possess
        in an unusual degree that perfection of de sign, beauty of expression, and
        inimitable grace, for which Raphael is said to be unequalled. Indeed, I have
        never seen any thing so beautiful as the face of the Virgin, whether on canvass
        or in nature. The Escorial likewise possesses a fine library of thirty thousand
        volumes ; four thousand of which are manuscripts, and half of these Arabian.
        A very valuable collection of Arabian manuscripts, arranged in a room of the
        convent, was destroyed by fire in 1671. Others, however, still re main, which
        furnished Conde, a late librarian, materials for his excellent history of
        the Arabs in Spain. The convent of the Escorial was formerly tenanted by one
        hundred and sixty monks of the order of Saint Jerome, and then its yearly
        revenue amounted to one hundred and thirty thousand dollars, proceeding from
        estates, and from a flock of thirty-six thousand merino sheep, which lived

        \ to their dates. There is also a large mass of papers, thrown together without\
        \ any arrangement at all. In fact, the whole collection is now in very great\
        \ disorder, and therefore much less available for historical research. I looked\

        \ ments. January, 1825, another newspaper was issued from the same office,\
        \ called The Preston Pilot, which is also published on the Saturday. No works\
        \ of any great note have been printed in this town, though several men of\
        \ literary eminence have received their education here.* The town of Preston\
        \ is deeply indebted to an alderman of this borough, of the name of Shepherd,\
        \ a physician of eminence, who died on the 4th of December, 1761, bequeathing,\
        \ by will,\" \" all and every of his books, of what nature or kind soever,\
        \ to his executors, in trust, for the mayor aud aldermen of the borough, or\
        \ corporation of Preston;\" and confiding to the said mayor and aldermen the\
        \ power to give to any person they should direct, the privilege to read or\
        \ inspect such books. The testator further bequeathed \xA3200, to be placed\
        \ out at interest, and to be applied by the mayor and aldermen to the purpose\
        \ of paying the librarian's salary; and the interest of the residue, being\
        \ \xA31000, arising out of his personal estates, he directed to be applied\
        \ by them in purchasing books for enlarging and increasing the library. Some\
        \ years ago a spacious library room, for the reception of these books, with\
        \ a private reading room attached, was erected adjoining the free school in\
        \ Preston, which is open at stated hours for the admission of persons by ticket\
        \ from the mayor or any of the aldermen. Important as was this munificent\
        \ donation, it must be obvious that Dr. Shepherd's library, even if it was\
        \ open without restriction, would by no means be equal to the literary requirements\
        \ of a town like Preston. Under the influence of this persuasion, a public\
        \ library was established in 1825, in Fishergate, named the \" Palatine Library,\"\
        \ which already numbers 120 subscribers, and con sists of about 1500 volumes.\
        \ The Preston institution for the diffusion of knowledge resembles in its\
        \ principal features a mechanic's institute. This excellent establishment\
        \ consists of a library with 2300 volumes, a museum of natural history and\
        \ miscellaneous rarities, and a large collection of insects formed by Mr.\
        \ William Helme, a weaver, and a reading and lecture room for the accommodation\
        \ of the members. The hall of the society is in Cannon-street, and was opened\
        \ in October, 1828. The number of subscribers exceeds 300. There is also a\
        \ law library, established in 1833, in which a society for the discussion\
        \ of legal subjects holds its meetings. It may not be improper to mention\
        \ in this place, that Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the great transatlantic philosopher,\
        \ twice visited Preston; first in the year 1771, and afterwards in 1775, and\
        \ that he was closely connected with one of the most * Dr. John Preston, the\
        \ father of the nonconformists, descended from the de Prestons; John Weaver,\
        \ the author of the Funeral Monuments; and the Rev. John Arkwright, were all\
        \ of Preston. It has been supposed that the Chief Baron Tomson was a native\
        \ of Preston, but this is an error ; the learned baron was born at Camberwell,\
        \ near London, on the 6th of January, 1745, and died on the 15th of April,\
        \ 1817. He had a sister, who took up her abode in Preston when it was \" the\
        \ resort of well-bred but ill-portioned old maids and widows,\" and hence\

        \ head librarian of the university ; a situation which, as it procured an\
        \ easy and quick access to books, was peculiarly agreeable to his taste and\
        \ habits. Some time after this, he was also appointed Casuistical Professor.\
        \ In the year 1762 he suffered an irreparable loss by the death of his wife\
        \ ; a loss in itself every way afflicting, and rendered more so by the situation\
        \ of his family, which then consisted of eleven children, many of them very\
        \ young. In the course of the next few years he received several preferments,\
        \ which were rather honourable expressions of regard from his friends, than\
        \ of much advantage to his fortune. By Dr. Cornwallis, then bishop of Litchfield,\
        \ afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, who had been his pupil at Christ's\
        \ College, he was appointed to the archdeaconry of Stafford shire, and to\
        \ a prebend in the church of Litchfield. By his old acquaintance, Dr. Green,\
        \ bishop of Lincoln, he was also made a prebendary of that church. But, in\
        \ the year 1767, by the intervention of the duke of Newcastle, to whose interest,\
        \ in the memorable contest for the high stewardship of the university, he\
        \ had adhered, in opposition to some tempta tions, he obtained a stall in\
        \ Durham cathedral. The year after this, the duke of Grafton, who had a short\
        \ time before been elected chancellor of the university, recommended the master\
        \ of Peter-house to his majesty for the bishopric of Carlisle. This recommen\
        \ dation was made, not only without his solicitation or that of his friends,\
        \ but without his knowledge, until the duke's intention in his favour was\
        \ signified to him by the archbishop. In 1777 Dr. Law gave to the public a\
        \ handsome edition, in three volumes quarto, of the Works of Mr. Locke, with\
        \ a Life of the Author, and a Preface. Mr. Locke's writings and character\
        \ he held in the highest esteem, and seems to have drawn from them many of\
        \ his own principles. Dr. Law held the see of Carlisle almost nineteen years\
        \ ; during which time he twice only omitted spending the summer months in\
        \ his diocese, at the bishop's residence at Rose Castle ; a situation with\
        \ which he was much pleased, not only on account of the natural beauty of\
        \ the place, but because it restored him to the country in which he had spent\
        \ the best part of his life. In the year 1787, he paid this visit in a state\
        \ of great weakness and exhaustion ; and died at Rose, about a month after\
        \ his arrival there, on the 14th of August, and in the 84th year of his age.\

        Concerning the day when the first English blood was spilled at Swansey, in
        this war, there seems, among historical writers, to be some discrepancy ;
        and the time of the arrival of the Plymouth forces at Swansey is also left
        in doubt. They are thus stated in a " Description of Bridgewater,"* published
        in the Mass. Hist. Soe. Collections, vol. VII. p. 156, Second series. " At
        the commencement of hostilities, June 21, 1675, seventeen of their number,"
        (of the people of Bridge water,) " well armed and furnished with horses, ''
        the first that were on their march in the country,'' went to Metapoiset, a
        small settlement about twelve miles from Swansey, '' to streangth en the garrison
        at that place.'' They were met by people from Swansey, driven from their habitations,
        and filled with terror, who advised and persuaded them to return ; but they
        fearlessly pursued their course and accomplished their object. They were in
        '' many perils '' while there, but returned safe ; after the greatest part
        of the garrison, consisting of seventy persons, most of whom were women and
        children, were safely conducted to Rhode Island. Six persons, who were killed
        at that time, as they were, with their teams, conveying their corn into the
        garri son, were the first that fell in that war." In the following quotation
        from " Baylies'' Memoir of Plym outh Colony," [vol. II. pt. 3d, p. 33,] they
        are stated to have been slain on the 22d of June. " The Bridgewater company

        felt, and another, much less indeed in point of size, but more agreeable in
        point of position, was erected at the south-east angle of the church, and
        is at present occupied in part by the gallery belonging to the Hammermen''s
        Incorporation. In the same angle there is a slender octagonal tower, capped
        with a stone spire. This tower contains a staircase, by which adulterers and
        such like offenders were led to the prison to do penance in the jougs, the
        rings of which still remain. The prison was taken down in 1826, and more appropriate
        embellishments substituted in its place. Upon one of the couples of the roof
        of this apartment there was engraved a rudely-formed kind of escutcheon, charged
        with the figure 4, upon the upright line of which, terminating below in a
        W, there was repre sented a Saxon E, with the date 1610. Under the escutcheon
        were the letters ivllioz, and under that, but of a larger size, i. avgs; the
        meaning of which would have puzzled Old Mortality himself, at least it is
        beyond my depth of comprehension. In the west end of the front aisle there
        is a small apartment, in which the clergymen who officiate in this and the
        South Church, assemble before and after service; it also contains a considerable
        library, but few are acquainted with its contents except the clergy men themselves.
        In the seventeenth century the General Assembly of the Church manifested a
        laudable anxiety for the instruction of the people, and one of the means resorted
        to for this purpose was the establishment of libraries, presbyterial and parochial.
        In 1704, there were nine teen presbyterial and fifty-eight parochial libraries
        existing, formed of books given at different times by the crown and by well-disposed
        persons. Of the parochial libraries, three, by Act xii. Assembly 1705, were
        ordered to be allotted to the Synod of Angus and Mearns ; but whether the
        one in Dundee, which existed before that time, formed one of them I have never
        heard. It is certain, however, that the community are proprietors of it, and
        that the parish minister, and the kirkmaster for the time, are joint librarians,
        and the magistrates and council are visitors.', 1]

        house of an Armenian, sor attempting to look into a Turkish book in a bazaar
        ; and Spon and Wheler complained of the same treatment. We sound no such feeling
        here. The librarian was civil and attentive, showed every book we wished to
        see, and freely suffered us to examine them ; and finding I was an imaun attached

        These libraries have received accessions of printed books from the press introduced
        into Constantinople in 1727. Three attempts were made to establish it. The
        first pro tluced eighteen books in twenty-eight years ; the second, six in
        ten years ; and the third, more successful, made by Abdul Hamed, father of
        the present Sultan, at Scutari, about forty books in as many years. The early
        efforts of the press were expended on military works, in which it was aided
        by one set up by the French embassy at Pera, from which issued translations
        into Turkish of some of the most celebrated European works, not only on military
        but naval tactics, which it is probable gave the first incentive to that alteration
        in the Turkish system which led to the destruc tion of the janissaries. The
        types of the first press were nearly worn out, and the printing bad ; but
        a new set was obtained for that at Scutari, which produced many neat and perfect
        impressions. I visited this printing office in 1 822, and obtained copies
        of several works executed there. The superintendent gave me a catalogue of

        been stripped of their costly furniture ; and although the massive candelabra

        monkish superstition was wont to flourish, when the mitred abbot, with four
        hundred priests, and even royalty itself, assisted at the ceremonial. With
        a lingering step, and many a longing look thrown back, did I leave this marble-studded
        hall. From the chapel we passed into the sacristy, and were thence conducted
        through corridors of immense length, lined on both sides by cells, to the
        kitchen, which was fitted out on a scale of magnitude and convenience apparently
        ill-suited to the abstemious habits professed by its late inmates. In the
        great dining-hall the seats and table-frames were of Brazil wood, supporting
        marble slabs. Dozens of these corridors and winding passages were passed in
        succession ; and on ascending an immense staircase, we were ushered into the
        library, with the exception of the chapel, the place of greatest interest
        here. It is one of the largest in Europe ; of fine proportions, and lighted
        from the top ; the books are in good preservation, and mostly on old divinity
        and jurisprudence, with, however, some antique aud very valuable editions
        of the Scriptures in Arabic and other oriental dialects. It is clean, and
        well aired ; but the present librarian could afford us but little information,
        not being able to read himself! The whole of this vast assemblage of literature,
        the accumulation of centuries, is about to be removed to a library erecting
        at Lisbon, and designed to hold the books of all the monastic establishments
        in the kingdom. From thence we proceeded to the flat roof, where alone we
        could judge of the prodigious extent of the building, and there our wonder
        ceased at its holding 10,000 men. The convent forms a grand square, intersected
        in the centre by rows of chambers of a lesser height. In the midst are fountains,

        a mortal wound, he requested that, after his death, crosses might be placed
        at either end of his grave. The Catholic ministers, in giving an account of
        their first missionary labors in this country, speak of the custom of the
        natives in wearing crosses. Such must have been introduced by the Northmen
        Christians. I mentioned this circumstance, lately, to the librarian of the
        Ameri can Antiquarian Society, Worcester ; and he said that a cross had been
        sent to that institution by a gentleman of Ohio. I saw this emblem of the
        Christian faith. It must have been hid from the light of heaven for centuries.
        This silver cross is about two and a half inches long. It was found on the
        breast of a female skeleton, one which was dug from a mound at Columbus, over
        which a forest of trees had grown. On this cross the capital letters I. S.
        are perfectly visible. And what can these letters imply, but the initials
        of the sacred name, Iesus Salvator? Who can doubt, then, that the " Sun of
        Righteousness " cast his bright beams on the land west of the dread Atlantic,
        long before the time of Columbus ? In 1006, Thorfins or Thorfin commanded
        one of the three ships that came from Iceland to Greenland. He was of royal
        lineage. In the spring of 1007, Thorfin, with three ships and one hundred
        and sixty men, besides cattle and all necessary materials for establish- ing
        a colony, set sail for Vinland. They sailed to Helluland or Labrador ; from
        thence to Markland or Nova Scotia ; and from thence to Kjarlanes, or Cape
        Cod. Sailing south by the east side of the promontory which terminated at
        Kjar- lanes, they passed along beaches or trackless deserts of sand. How descriptive
        of this bleak and sterile coast ! Those who have sailed from Boston to Narragansett
        Bay, are ready to say that I am not drawing an ideal picture. Continuing their
        course they arrived at an island. They called it Shaumey. This is supposed
        to be Martha''s Vineyard. Nine men went away in one of the ships and never
        returned. It is said they were driven on the coast of Ireland, where they
        were seized as slaves. In the spring, Thorfin and one hundred and fifty others
        went to the main land. They called the place Hop, the residenee afterwards
        of king Philip. Here they found large numbers of skrellings or natives. Thorfin
        carried on a traffic with them, by exchanging bits of colored cloth for furs.
        In consequence of their frequent attacks, in 1009 they returned to Greenland.
        Then, it will be recollected, the North- men had not the use of fire-arms
        with which to defend themselves against the assaults of the savages. These
        lords of the wilds had a rude kind of engine, by which they hurled large stones
        against their foes ; and it is possible that the white man would never have
        driven the red man from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains, but for the in
        vention of gunpowder. I cannot forbear to speak of the valor of one of this
        crew of the Northmen, a female. When all the rest were disposed to flee before
        the savage foe, she exclaimed : " If I only had a weapon, I ween I could fight
        better than any of you." Ah ! when we consider the pa-', 1]
    - ["DISCOVERY OF AMERICA. 11 of the manuscripts, from which the publication has\
        \ been made, suffi cient to raise them above any just suspicion. These documents,\
        \ as Professor Rafn says, have been known to Ice landic scholars ; but these\
        \ have been so few, comparatively, and the means of these few so limited,\
        \ that they have not been able to give them suitable examination, much less\
        \ to be at the expense of publish ing them. How long did the ancient classics,\
        \ for instance, lay concealed in the monasteries of Europe, for the want of\
        \ some one to exhibit them to public view ? These Icelandic documents may\
        \ have been hid, in like manner, in the libraries of priests. And we may say\
        \ that the Society of Antiquarians, in Copenhagen, in bringing these documents\
        \ to light, resembles the conduct of the poet laureate, Petrarch, in the fourteenth\
        \ century, who, at his own expense, had the valuable manuscripts of an tiquity\
        \ dragged from the dust of the cloisters, transcribed, and exhibit ed to the\
        \ world. Who does not admire the lovely scenery, where the beautiful and sublime\
        \ are blended, displayed in the succession of Falls at Trenton ? Yet these\
        \ were concealed for ages, till a master-spirit revealed them to an admiring\
        \ world. And does not the raven wing of night hide the works of art, also,\
        \ till disclosed in a similar way ? The learned of Iceland, though, like the\
        \ generality of poets, poor ; yet they were not disposed, like Milton, to\
        \ sell their manuscripts for a paltry sum. It is well known the Norwegians\
        \ have long claimed the honor of dis- covering and colonizing America before\
        \ the time of Columbus. Instead of this discovery being a new-fangled theory,\
        \ as some say, there have been several works published in Europe, upwards\
        \ of a cen- tury, which speak of these facts. Wormius speaks of this discovery,\
        \ in a Latin translation, published at the University of Oxford, in or about\
        \ 1716. In Adam of Bremen's account, published 1629, he uses the following\
        \ striking language : \" Non fabulosa opinione, sed certa re- latione Danorum\
        \ ;\" that is, in a free translation, \" This is not a fabu- lous opinion,\
        \ but a true narrative, given by the Danes themselves.\" Dr. Franklin, in\
        \ a letter to a distinguished antiquary formerly of Swit- zerland, says, positively,\
        \ that the Danes came into New-England before the time of Columbus. Dr. Mather\
        \ published an account, also, of this discovery, in 1772. The celebrated Dr.\
        \ Henderson, who travelled in Iceland, says that the fact of this early discovery\
        \ was well known to the Icelanders \u2014 that it was authenticated by Northern\
        \ historians. It is a remarkable fact, that Iceland, where these documents\
        \ relating to the early discovery were preserved, were the Athens of the North,\
        \ during the Dark Ages. During the Middle Ages, the Icelanders were the most\
        \ intelligent people in the North. Even now, as Henderson says, youth can\
        \ repeat passages from Latin and Greek authors, who have never been but a\
        \ few miles from the place of their birth. Truly, the hardy Icelanders were\
        \ our librarians and historians. Iceland appears to have been a medium of\
        \ communication between Norway and Greenland, \u2014 a stepping-stone, as\
        \ it were, from one conti nent to another.", 1]

        \ LEARNED MEN. A.D. 1547 to 1603. The Elizabethan age was more pre-emi nent\
        \ in literature than science, and its men of letters chiefly excelled in the\
        \ production of works of history and the imagination. Its sweet poetry helped\
        \ to correct the auste rities of puritanism, but there were still no sound\
        \ teachers of moral and political philo sophy. The next reign was more advanced,\
        \ and minds appeared who sought to enlarge the circle of knowledge by more\
        \ compre hensive deductions than those derived from classic and scriptural\
        \ quotations. The lite rary character of the time will appear from the following\
        \ notice of the chief writers who flourished in the latter half of the sixteenth\
        \ century. Sir Thomas Smith was an acute meta physician, accomplished statesman,\
        \ anil able soldier. He was professor of Greek at Cambridge, and suggested\
        \ a new mode of accenting that language ; he also funned a new alphabet for\
        \ the English tongue, consisting of twenty-nine letters. To him collegiate\
        \ bodies are indebted for the sta tute which directs, that the third part\
        \ us the rent on college leases should be re served in corn. Sir Thomas died\
        \ in 1577, at his seat, Mounthall, in Essex, aged 67 years. Edward Hall, who\
        \ died in 1547, was a Londoner, bred at Eton and King's Col lege, Cambridge.\
        \ He was a judge in the sheriff's court, and member of the house of commons.\
        \ His \" Chronicle ofthe Wars between the Roses \" is valuable, and curi ous\
        \ as affording delineations of the man ners, dress, and customs of the people\
        \ dur ing that turbulent era. John Leland was chaplain, librarian, and antiquarian\
        \ to Henry VIII. To him is owing the preservation of numerous manu scripts,\
        \ which the libraries of religious houses contained, and which, by accepting\
        \ the office of visitor at their dissolution, he saved from destruction. He\
        \ became in sane, either from the excessive fatigue of arranging these papers,\
        \ or some other cause, and died in 1552. Apart of his volumi nous collections\
        \ was printed by Hearne, in 9 vols. 8vo, under the title of \" The Itinerary\
        \ of John Leland.\" The rest of his works remain in MS. in the Bodleian library.\
        \ William Fleetwood was an eminent law yer, and appointed recorder of London\
        \ in 1569. He was the author of a \" Tieatise on the Office of Justice of\
        \ the Peace,\" and other law tracts. Wood says, he was \" a good antiquary,\
        \ but of a marvellous merry and pleasant conceit.\" He descended from a respectable\
        \ Lancashire family, aud died at his seat, at Great Missenden, in Buck inghamshire,\
        \ in 1593. Sir Walter Raleigh, who was beheaded in 1618, belongs to the next,\
        \ rather than the present reign, but as his prosperous days ended with the\
        \ death of Elizabeth, he may be suitably noticed in this place. He was the\
        \ son of a Devonshire gentle man, and a distinguished warrior, states man,\
        \ and writer. His expedition to Ame rica, while under sentence tor high treason,\
        \ and his urging, and personally witnessing, the execution of the earl of\

        \ that there were six men to carry the coffin to the vault ; that there were\

        \ did not believe there was any tombstone, but as all the vaults, in obedience\

        \ scholasticism. 46 The members of the University having so stoutly supported\
        \ the duke of Burgundy, it was fair that he should support them in his turn.\
        \ And first of all, he terminated, to their advantage, the affair which had\
        \ for a whole year embroiled the two jurisdictions, the civil and ecclesiastical.\
        \ The first was found to be in the wrong. The University, the clergy repaired\
        \ to take down the two thieves, the two scholars, whose skeletons still wavered\
        \ in the breeze at Montfaucon. A whole people of priests, of monks, of clerks,\
        \ of scholars, animated by a frenzied joy, bore them through Paris as far\
        \ as the parvis Notre-Dame, where they were remitted to the ecclesiastical\
        \ jurisdiction, and de posed at the feet of the bishop *. The provost besought\
        \ pardon from the rectors, doctors, and regents +. This triumph of two corpses,\
        \ which was the burial of the royal justiciary power, took place in the light\
        \ of a May sun : saddened by the light of the torches carried by this black-robed\
        \ multitude J. On the 14th of May, the very evening before the University\
        \ gained this great victory, two messen gers from pope Benedict XIII. had\
        \ had the hardi hood to come to brave in Paris this choleric power. They were\
        \ the bearers of menacing bulls, in which the enemy, who was believed to be\
        \ prostrate on the ground, seemed fuller of life than ever \xA7. It was an\
        \ Aragonese gentleman (Benedict XIII. was from Aragon) who had ventured on\
        \ this stroke. A deputation from the University came with loud clamour, demanding\
        \ justice. A grand assem bly was held at the hotel Saint-Paul, in presence\
        \ of the king, of the duke of Burgundy, and of the princes ; where a violent\
        \ sermon was delivered by Jean Petit's discourse, too, would scarcely deserve\
        \ a remark, were it the mere work of the pedant, the undigested abortion of\
        \ a pedagogue's brain. But no ; we must not forget that Jean Petit was a doctor\
        \ of high estimation and authority. This foul and monstrous mass of confusion\
        \ and inconsistency, this savage mixture of so many ill understood things,\
        \ belongs to the age, and must not be charged on the man. I see in it the\
        \ grin ning countenance of the decaying middle age, the mask, \u2014 half\
        \ human, half brute-like \u2014 of the scho lastic in its death-struggle.\
        \ Still, history presents no more shocking object. This medley of equivocations,\
        \ of mistakes, of truths travestied, and of sorry reasonings, in which the\
        \ absurd is magisterially based on the false, is laugh able ; we laugh, but\
        \ we shudder. These ridiculous syllogisms have assassination for their major,\
        \ and the conclusion leads us back to it. History escapes as she may. False\
        \ science, like a tyrant, mal treats her and does her violence. The one muti\
        \ lates and hacks facts, as the other does men ; slaying the emperor Julian\
        \ with the lance of the crusader, and murdering C\xE6sar with the knife of\
        \ the Bible, so that the whole wears the air of an indistinct massacre of\
        \ men and of doctrines, of ideas and of facts. Though there had been a glimpse\
        \ of good sense in this treatise on assassination, though the crimes of the\
        \ duke of Orleans had been proved, and he had deserved death, still this would\
        \ not have justi fied the duke of Burgundy's treachery. What ! for faults\
        \ of such old date, after a solemn reconci liation, after having eaten together,\
        \ and partaken of the same host in holy communion ! . . . . And to kill him\
        \ by night, in ambush, disarmed, was that knightly ? A knight should attack\
        \ his enemy with equal arms, slay him in open lists. A prince, a great sovereign,\
        \ ought to make war at the head of an army, and overcome his enemy in battle\
        \ ; battles are the duels of kings. After all, Jean Petit's harangue was less\
        \ an apology for the duke of Burgundy, than a declama tion against the duke\
        \ of Orleans : it was an outrage after death ; as if the murderer returned\
        \ to his victim, lying stretched on the ground, fearful lest he should revive,\
        \ and endeavoured to kill him a second time. The murderer had no need of apology.\
        \ Whilst his doctor was perorating, he had in his pocket good letters of pardon,\
        \ which washed him white as snow. In these letters, the king sets forth that\
        \ the duke has explained to him, how for his good and that of his kingdom,\
        \ \"lie has caused to be removed from this world\" his brother, the duke of\

        of prejudice and of party spirit, as Malmesbury, Hoveden and others, represent
        him to have been possessed of great pene tration, and universal knowledge
        in learning ; and that Anastasius the librarian, his con temporary, in his
        letter, 23d March, 875, to Charles the Bald, says, " that he was a man eminent
        for his sanctity, and that he ascribes to the special influence of the spirit
        of God, his translation of the works of St. Denis, finding it extraordinary
        that such a work could have been written by a barbarian (this epithet is unfit)
        of Scotia, situated at the extremity of the earth, without the special aid
        of the spirit of God." Dempster, says Ware, vainly endeavours to change the
        country of John Erigena, because his con temporaries called him Scotus ; which,
        how ever, was the general name of the Irish in that century ; Erigena, signifies
        indeed a native of Erin, which is the real name of Ireland ; as Angligena
        signifies an English man, and Francigena a Frenchman. When we consider the
        advantages which the Scoto-Milesians enjoyed with respect to religion and
        the sciences, in the first ages of Christianity, could we suppose them not
        to have possessed, likewise, cultivated minds and polished manners ? The sciences
        which enlighten and ornament the understanding, flourished amongst them more
        than in any other nation. That Christian morality which regulates the motions
        of the heart, formed men among them who were celebrated for the sanctity of
        their morals. Notwithstand^ ing these advantages, an astonishing mixture of
        vice and virtue was discoverable among them, and as a certain author remarks,
        " they were ardent in every thing, whether good or evil : " In omnes affectus
        vehemen tissimi." Whilst one part of that people devoted themselves to God,
        by renouncing all intercourse with the world, and thereby served as a model
        to the neighbouring nations ; the spirit of discord was still kept up, either
        by the tyranny of their princes, the ambition of their nobles, or the frequent

        Picts, the inhabitants of the Orkneys, Hebrides, and the Isle of Man, they
        were always in arms, one against the other, and the gospel which they had
        just received with so much respect, was not able to remove that spirit of
        discord which was the cause of such disorders. consider that passion, which
        in truth, savours of ferocity, as a virtue, and as true heroism. Every man
        in particular has some ruling propensity, and it is almost the same with nations.
        The passions have different shades and different degrees of enormity among
        different people. Like other nations which were their con temporaries, the
        Scoto-Milesians possessed a mixture of virtue and vice ; they were super stitiously
        attached to their religion ; noble in their sentiments, humane, hospitable,
        and sincere friends, but implacable enemies. They considered it a dishonour
        to seek re dress for an insult by resorting to justice; and a spirit of revenge,
        common to both prince and people, was the cause of their frequent wars. Their
        kings, unattended by guards, com manded their armies in person, always marching
        at the head of their troops. The manner of fighting at that time was very
        different from what it is at present, and their battles much more bloody,
        from which it cannot be a matter of surprise, that so many fives were lost
        in war. It might appear, that this martial spirit, and their frequent wars,
        must have injured agriculture, trade, and literature ; but as their campaigns
        were of short duration, and that a war was frequently terminated by a single
        battle, they had sufficient time for cultivating their lands, and feeding
        their flocks ; two things, which essentially formed the sources of wealth,
        and maintained, both in their food and raiment, that noble simpli city which
        prevailed universally amongst them. Luxury, which commonly implies abundance
        among a certain number, and indigence amongst others, was unknown to the Irish,
        who were accustomed, for many ages, to live on the productions of the earth.
        Each tribe possessed their hereditary right of territory, and the chief distributed
        among the different branches of his tribe, fiefs and lands, from whence they
        easily derived their subsistence. They were unacquainted with that pomp and
        false splendour which fre quently place people, of the lowest rank, above
        men of honour : virtue, birth, and a diversity of colours in their dress,
        were the distinguishing marks of rank among them ; the great did not despise
        the little, and the latter joyfully acknowledged their depen dence. Avarice
        was not known among a peo ple who amassed nothing ; whatsoever they themselves
        had no need of, was appropriated to the wants of hospitality, and their houses

        It was said at the time to have cost five hundred guineas. The Philadelphia
        Library passed through the Revolution with out suffering any special detriment;
        both of the opposing parties had the benefit of it. In August, 1774, it was
        ordered " that the librarian furnish the gentlemen who are to meet in congress
        iu this city with such books as they may have occasion for during their sitting,
        taking a receipt from them ;" and the British army officers who occupied the
        city during the winter of 1777-78 were in the habit of using the library,
        but invariably paid for the privilege. At the close of the war the number
        of books was about 5000. The present building has a quiet, venerable appearance,
        and its interior, though plain, is impressive. Besides the books, the rooms
        contain portraits of Lord Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, Wil liam Penn, John Penn,
        James Logan, Benjamin Franklin, Rev. Samuel Preston, a benefactor (the portrait
        by West), William Mackenzie, a donor of books, Joseph Fisher, a donor of money,
        Thomas Parke, Zachariah Poulson, and others. There are various relics, such
        as William Penn''s writing-desk; a colossal bust of Minerva which formerly
        stood behind the Speaker''s chair in the first Congress under the Constitution
        ; a mask of Wash ington''s face from the original and used for Houdon''s statue
        ; a reading-desk of John Dickinson, author of The Farmer''s Letters; James
        Logan''s library-table, and other curiosities. Many of the books are now excessively
        rare and of great value ; there are manuscripts in various languages; incunabula
        or specimens of the work of the earliest printers; finely-illustrated volumes
        of antiquities; many costly and large illustrated books; and the collection
        of books on America is unusually full and valuable, especially on the local
        history of the city and State, including complete files of newspapers from
        1719 to the present day, and all the important maps. The arrangement of the
        books on the shelves is by sizes, not by subjects, which presents a uniformity
        of appearance ; they are readily utilized by classified alphabetical catalogues.

        \ and resources, and the title of the United States to the same. Mr. Greenhow,\

        \ leisure to compare the statements in the Memoir with the various works and\
        \ documents upon which they are founded, I can vouch only for the zeal, industry,\
        \ and good faith of Mr. Greenhow, by whom they were prepared. I am, sir, your\
        \ most obedient servant, JOHN FORSYTH, Secretary of State. From the Journal\

    - ["PREFACE. XIX the manuscript of my translation as far as it had then proceeded,\
        \ and requested his advice respecting my intention of laying it before the\
        \ Board. On this latter point his opinion was such as, with a little more\
        \ thought, I might have anticipated, namely, that he did not see how the Board\
        \ of the University could lend their sanction, by any public reward, to writings\
        \ so convivial and amatory as were almost all those of Anacreon. He very good-naturedly,\
        \ however, lauded my translation, and advised me to complete and publish it\
        \ ; adding, I well recollect, \" young people will like it.\" I was also indebted\
        \ to him for the use, during my task, of Spaletti's curious publication, giving\
        \ a facsimile of those pages of a MS. in the Vatican Library which contain\
        \ the Odes, or \" Symposiacs,\" attributed to Anacreon.* And here I shall\
        \ venture to add a few passing words on a point which I once should have thought\
        \ it profanation to question, \u2014 the authenticity of these poems. The\
        \ cry raised against their genuineness by Robertellus and other enemies of\
        \ Henry Stephen, when that eminent scholar first introduced them to the learned\
        \ world, may be thought to have long since entirely subsided, leaving their\
        \ claim to so ancient a paternity safe and unquestioned. But I am forced,\
        \ however reluctantly, to confess that there appear to me strong grounds for\
        \ pronouncing these light and beautiful lyrics to be merely modern fabrications.\
        \ Some of the reasons that incline me to adopt this unwelcome conclu sion\
        \ are thus clearly stated by the same able scholar, to whom I am indebted\
        \ for the emen dations of my own juvenile Greek ode : \u2014 \"I do not see\
        \ how it is possible, if Anacreon had written chiefly in Iambic dimeter verse,\
        \ that Horace should have wholly neglected that metre. I may add that, of\
        \ those fragments of Anacreon, of whose genuineness, from internal evidence,\
        \ there can be no doubt, almost all are written in one or other of the lighter\
        \ Horatian metres, and scarcely one in Iambic dimeter verse. This may be seen\
        \ by looking through the list in Fischer.\" The unskilful attempt at Greek\
        \ verse from my own pen, which is found prefixed to the Translation, was intended\
        \ originally to illus trate a picture, representing Anacreon con versing with\
        \ the Goddess of Wisdom, from which the frontispiece to the first edition\
        \ of the work was taken. Had I been brought up with a due fear of the laws\
        \ of prosody before my eyes, I certainly should not have dared to submit so\
        \ untutored a production to the criti cism of the trained prosodians of the\
        \ English schools. At the same time, I cannot help adding that, as far as\
        \ music, distinct from metre, is concerned, I am much inclined to prefer the\
        \ ode as originally written to its pre sent corrected shape ; and that, at\
        \ all events, I entertain but very little doubt as to which of the two a composer\
        \ would most willingly set to music. For the means of collecting the materials\
        \ of the notes appended to the Translation, I was chiefly indebted to the\
        \ old library adjoining St. Patrick's Cathedral, called, from the name of\
        \ the archbishop who founded it, Marsh's Library. Through my acquaintance\
        \ with the deputy librarian, the Rev. Mr Cradock, I enjoyed the privilege\
        \ of constant access to this collection, even at that period of the year when\
        \ it is always closed to the public. On these occa sions I used to be locked\
        \ in there alone ; and to the many solitary hours which, both at the time\
        \ I am now speaking of and subsequently, I passed in hunting through the dusty\
        \ tomes of this old library, I owe much of that odd and out-of-the-way sort\
        \ of reading which may be found scattered through some of my earlier writings.\
        \ o' Early in the year 1799, while yet in my nineteenth year, I left Ireland,\
        \ for the first time, and proceeded to London, with the two not very congenial\
        \ objects, of keeping my terms at the Middle Temple, and publishing, by sub\
        \ scription, my Translation of Anacreon. One of those persons to whom, through\
        \ the active zeal of friends, some part of my manuscript had been submitted\
        \ before it went to press, * When the monument to Provost Baldwin, which stands\
        \ in the hall of the College of Dublin, arrived from Italy, there came in\
        \ the same packing-case with it two copies of this work of Spaletti, one of\
        \ which was presented by Dr. Troy, the Roman Catholic Archbishop, as a gift\
        \ from the Pope to the Library of the University, and the other (of which\
        \ I was sub sequently favoured with the use) he presented, in like manner,\
        \ to my friend. Dr. Kearney. Thus, curiously enough, while Anacreon in English\
        \ was considered \u2014 and, I grant, on no unreasonable grounds \u2014 as\
        \ a work to which grave collegiate authorities could not openly lend their\
        \ sanction, Anacreon in Greek was thought no unfitting present to be received\
        \ by a Protestant bishop, through the medium of a Catholic arch bishop, from\
        \ the hands of his holiness, the Pope.", 1]

        might arise Avith France or England, both of which were then interfering with
        our commerce ; and it was proposed to raise a company of minute-men to be
        ready in case of need. The town met to consider the proposals of the militia-men
        who had volunteered for the public service as soldiers, and voted that each
        soldier, Avhen equipped to the satisfaction of his commanding officer, and
        producing a certificate thereof to the selectmen, should receive nine shillings
        as bounty, and when called into actual service should receive nine dollars
        a month, including the wages given by Congress. For several years, a debate
        was carried on as to the proper location of a neAV Pound, and the materials
        of Avhich it should be built. In 1784, Charles Barrett, Esq. built the present
        pound, on his own land, at the corner of the old burying ground, and at his
        own expense, and made a free gift of them both to the town, for which a vote
        of thanks Avas passed. Thus that matter was set at rest. In 1789, a meeting
        Avas held to choose an agent, to defend in a suit brought against the tOAvn
        by Dr. John Preston. It Avas probably brought for medical services rendered
        to the poor. It was agreed to leave the matter to the discretion of the Selectmen
        ; but it was also voted, " not to employ Dr. John Preston in future to doctor
        the toAvn''s poor." This vote, however, was reconsidered two years afterAvards.
        In 1791, an attempt Avas made to raise money to procure a tOAvn Library, in
        connection Avith the Demosthenian Society, which had been established by the
        scholars of the Academy, but it failed. A tOAvn library Avas, hoAvever, soon
        after estab lished by subscription, and held in shares. In 1799, it was voted
        " that the United States'' LaAvs, conveyed to this tOAvn by Ephraim Hartwell,
        Esq., be deposited in the hands of the librarian of the Town Library, (so
        called in distinction from the Demosthenean ;) said librarian is, in consequence
        of this vote, authorized to loan said books at his discretion, to any person
        in this or in the Ninth District, who shall apply for the same." This Library
        Avas burnt in 1812 ; and at that time numbered betAveen three and four hundred
        volumes. One of the practices of which there is frequent mention in', 2]

        Marsden was unmarried, never having found time to think of a wife, and having
        been wedded to study even since his early youth. He was chief librarian, and
        held the keys of knowledge both literally and figurately. He was avowedly
        a silent man, and, except on one or two subjects, rarely said more than yes
        or no. Absent to a degree, his mind never seemed at home, and a sudden question
        startled him as much as a sudden accident. But he was a good and kind man,
        and although he never made any professions, a staunch friend when once he
        became attached. He was pre-disposed to like Herbert for his grandfather''s

        \ before he said, \" It's a' ower \u2014 she has passed away even with that\
        \ last word.\" \" Impossible,\" said Oldbuck, hastily advancing, as did his\
        \ nephew. But nothing was more certain. She had expired with the last hurried\
        \ word that left her lips ; and all that remained before them were the mortal\
        \ relics of the creature Avho had so long struggled with an internal sense\
        \ of concealed guilt, joined to aU the distresses of age ancl poverty. \"\
        \ God grant that she be gane to a better place !\" said Edie, as he looked\
        \ on the lifeless body ; \" but oh ! there was something lying hard and heavy\
        \ at her heart. I have seen remarkable for creating and possessing a most\
        \ curious and splendid library, than for his acquaintance with the literary\
        \ treasures it contained. In arranging his books, fetching and replacing the\
        \ volumes which he wanted, and carrying on all the necessary intercourse which\
        \ a man of letters holds with his library, it was the Duke's custom to employ,\
        \ not a secretary or librarian, but a livery servant, called Archie, whom\
        \ habit had made so perfectly acquainted with the library, that he knew every\
        \ book, as a shepherd does the individuals of his flock, by what is called\
        \ headmark, and could bring his master whatever volume he wanted, and afford\
        \ all the mechanical aid the Duke required in his literary researches. To\
        \ secure tho attendance of Archie, there was a bell hung in his room, which\
        \ was used on no occasion except to call him individually to the Duke's study.\
        \ His Grace died in Saint James's Square, London, in the year 1804 ; the body\
        \ was to be conveyed to Scotland, to lie in state at his mansion of Fleurs,\
        \ and to be removed from thence to the family burial-place at Bowden. At this\
        \ time, Archie, who had been long attacked by a liver complaint, was in the\
        \ very last stage of that disease. Yet lie prepared himself to accompany the\
        \ body ofthe master whom he had so long and so faithfully waited upon. The\
        \ medical persons assured him he could not survive the journey. It signified\
        \ nothing, he said, whether he died in England or Scotland ; he was resolved\
        \ to assist in rendering the last honours to the kind master fi-om whom he\
        \ had been inseparable for so many years, even if he should expire in the\
        \ attempt. The poor invalid was permitted to attend the Duke's body to Scotland\
        \ ; but when they reached Fleurs he was totally exhausted, and obliged to\
        \ keep his bed, in a sort of stupor which announced speedy dissolution. On\
        \ the morning ofthe day fixed for removing the dead body of the Duke to the\
        \ place of burial, the private bell by wliich he was wont to summon his attendant\
        \ to his study was rung violently. This might easily happen in the confusion\
        \ of such a scene, although the people of the neighbourhood prefer believing\
        \ that the bell sounded of its own accord. Ring, however, it did ; and Archie,\
        \ roused by the well-known summons, rose up in his bed, and faltered, in broken\
        \ accents, \" Yes, my Lord Duko-yes-I will wait on your Grace instantly ;\xBB\
        \ and with these words on his lips, he is said to have fallen back and expired.",

        The women were occupied in milking the goats with which we supplied them for
        the nourishment of their little ones. The Bishop had hired twelve large carriages
        to convey the wo men and children to the place of rendezvous, and the men
        were to follow on foot. Each person was pro vided with a bournou, two foulards,
        bread, and other provisions, and the little caravan, preceded by the Bishop''s
        carriage, set off, unescorted by any troops. The first halting place was Bouffarick,
        a village about seven leagues from Algiers. An unforeseen circumstance almost
        caused the project to fail, at the very moment when those con cerned in it
        were most sure of its accomplishment. A French column, commanded by General
        Baraguay d''Hilliers, had that very morning taken possession of the farm of
        Mouza''ia. The kalifat, on seeing the place he had designated seized by the
        enemy, thought that he was betrayed, and retreated, carrying with him the
        French prisoners. The news of this unfor tunate event soon reached the Bishop,
        who never theless was determined to set all matters right, and clear his countrymen
        from the suspicion attached to them. He dispatched the Abbe Suchet, Mr. Berbrugger,
        the librarian of Algiers, andToustain the interpreter, to explain the mistake
        to Mahomet-ben- Allah ; but it was not without some difficulty that the messengers
        of the Bishop contrived to fix new terms for the treaty, and to appoint the
        time and place where the exchange of prisoners was to be effected. At last
        it was agreed that the parties should meet', 1]

        \ of this transit in different parts of the world ; particularly from a set\
        \ of such observations made in a southern latitude, between the 140th and\
        \ 180th degrees of longitude, west from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich\
        \ ; and that vessels, properly equipped, would be necessary to convey the\
        \ observers to their destined stations ; but that the Society were in no condition\
        \ to defray the expense of such an undertaking. In conse quence of this memorial,\
        \ the Admiralty were directed by his Majesty to provide proper vessels for\
        \ this purpose. Accordingly, the Endeavour bark, which had been built for\
        \ the coal-trade, was purchased and fitted out for the southern voyage ; and\
        \ I was honoured with the command of her. The Royal Society soon after appointed\
        \ me, in conjunction with Mr. Charles Green the astronomer, to make the requisite\
        \ observations on the transit. It was at first intended to perform this great,\
        \ and now a principal business of our voyage, either at the Marquesas, or\
        \ else at one of those islands which Tasman had called Amster dam, Rotterdam,\
        \ and Middleburgh, now better known under the name of the Friendly Islands.\
        \ But while the Endeavour was getting ready for the expedition, Captain Wallis\
        \ returned from his voyage round the world, in the course of which he had\
        \ discovered several islands in the South Sea ; and amongst others, Otaheite.\
        \ This island was preferred to any of those before mentioned, on account of\
        \ the conveniences it afforded ; and because its place had been well ascertained,\
        \ and found to be extremely well suited to our purpose. I was therefore ordered\
        \ to proceed directly to Otaheite ; and, after the astronomical observations\
        \ should be completed, to prosecute the design of making discoveries in the\
        \ South Pacific Ocean, by proceeding to the south as far as the latitude of\
        \ 40\xB0 ; then, if I found no land, to proceed to the west between 40\xB0\
        \ and 35\xB0, till I fell in with New Zealand, which I was to explore ; and\
        \ thence to return to England, by such route as I should think proper. In\
        \ the prosecution of these instructions, I sailed from Deptford the 30th of\
        \ July, 1768 ; from Plymouth the 26th of August ; touched at Madeira, Rio\
        \ de Janeiro, and Straits Le Maire ; and entered the South Pacific Ocean by\
        \ Cape Horn, in January the following year. I endeavoured to make a direct\
        \ course to Otaheite, and in part succeeded ; but I made no discovery till\
        \ I got within the tropic, where I fell in with Lagoon Island ; Two Groups\
        \ ; Bird Island ; Chain Island ; and on the 13th of April arrived at Otaheite,\
        \ where I remained three months, during which time the observations on the\
        \ transit were made. I then left it ; discovered, and visited the Society\
        \ Isles, and Oheteroa ; thence proceeded to the south till I arrived in the\
        \ latitude of 40\xB0 22', longitude 147\xB0 29' West ; and on the 6th of October\
        \ fell in with the east side of New Zealand. I continued exploring the coast\
        \ of this country till the 31st of March, 1770, when I quitted it, and proceeded\
        \ to New Holland ; and having surveyed the eastern coast of that vast country,\
        \ which part had not before been visited, I passed between its northern extremity\
        \ and New Guinea ; landed on the latter ; touched at the island of Savu, Batavia,\
        \ the Cape of Good Hope, and St. Helena* ; and arrived in England on the 12th\
        \ of July, 177 1- In this voyage I was accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander\
        \ ; the first a gentleman of ample fortune ; the other an accomplished disciple\
        \ of Linn\xE6us, and one of the librarians of the British Museum : both of\

  - - ["DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND. 141 by Dr. William Hunter. A year\
        \ or two after, lectures on electricity, with the Franklinian experiments,\
        \ were given by Solomon Southwick, the father of the gentleman of the same\
        \ name in Albany. From about 1756, there was more gen eral literature in Newport,\
        \ and through the island, than perhaps any other part of America, which was\
        \ owing to a very well-selected public library given by Abraham Redwood, esquire,\
        \ a very op ulent and generous person belonging to the society of friends.\
        \ He gave five hundred pounds sterling for the books in London. These were\
        \ selected with great judgment by the colony agent, and some were added by\
        \ private donations. President Styles was its librarian be tween twenty and\
        \ thirty years. After a British army took possession of the island, this valuable\
        \ selection of books was despoiled of a great portion of the English classics,\
        \ histories, voyages, and travels, and whatever came under the head of entertaining\
        \ books. The li brary is still respectable. Among military men, Rhode Island\
        \ gave to the nation General Greene and Commodore Perry. The once very beautiful\
        \ scenery which embellished the island, and its character for healthful ness,\
        \ drew to it every summer numbers of opulent invalids, with not a few men\
        \ of property, who sought pleasure and agreeable residence. It was the perma\
        \ nent residence of many men of inde pendent fortune, past the meridian of\
        \ life, from different parts of Europe and the West India islands, and who\
        \ chose that spot in which to spend their days. This accounts for the large\
        \ number of tories, or gentlemen who wished for no alteration in government\
        \ and the habit ual order of things. Besides very handsome country-seats,\
        \ that island contained three gardens that merited, in some measure, the name\
        \ of botanical gardens, having greenhouses and hothouses, with curious foreign\
        \ plants. Those belonging to Malborne. Redwood, and Bowler, were the most\
        \ distinguished. The most elegant and costly dwellinghouse in the twelve col\
        \ onies was the country-seat of Colonel Malborne, which was accidentally de-\
        \ stroyed by fire previous to the revolu tionary war. The beautiful spot now\
        \ belongs to another family. Before the revolution, Rhode Island with its\
        \ capital (Newport) was the most agreeable spot on the Atlantic shores. It\
        \ enjoyed a very considerable com merce : the most lucrative, although not\
        \ the most moral, was the trade to Africa. Newport was then, from the causes\
        \ al ready mentioned, a lively, genteel, and literary town, and Providence\
        \ was com paratively small. But after the British took possession of it, the\
        \ town of Prov idence rose rapidly on the ruins of the capital. Upward of\
        \ nine hundred build ings, of all descriptions, were destroyed by the British,\
        \ principally for fuel ; and what was equally, if not more, to be la mented,\
        \ they also destroyed, through necessity, all the beautiful woods and ornamental\
        \ trees on that fine island. During these calamities, Providence, Bristol,\
        \ Warren, and several towns on the Narraganset shore, increased in size and\
        \ consequence, leaving the island, like an old battered shield, held up against\
        \ the enemy. If the general government can do anything to recover it to a\
        \ con dition in any respect equal to its formei consequence, they ought, in\
        \ gratitude, so to do ; for where is the spot in the United States that has\
        \ suffered so much as Newport on Rhode Island I While we are disposed to eulogize\
        \ Rhode Island, there is one thing we have always regretted, and that is its\
        \ penal code. In point of health and pro priety, her prisons were far behind\
        \ those of other states ; and the severity of their punishments far more rigorous\
        \ than in most of the other colonies and states. Their whipping at the cart's-tail\
        \ fell but little short of the Russian knot ; and their ear-croppings aud\
        \ brandings long continued after other states had me liorated their punishments\
        \ for theft aud forgery. The following shows the population of the state at\

        \ night, for many hours continuously. The next interesting feature of the\
        \ Capitol to be described is the Rotundo. It occu pies the centre, and is\
        \ ninety-six feet in diameter, and the same number of feet high. The dome\
        \ is hemispherical and filled with large plain caissons ; the room in its\
        \ circuit is divided into eight panels, intended for paintings, seven of which\
        \ are already filled ; and stationed between these panels are four bas-relievos\
        \ of historical subjects, one representing the Preservation of Capt. Smith\
        \ by Pocahontas, one the Landing of the Pilgrims on Plymouth Rock, one the\
        \ Conflict between Daniel Boone and the Indians, and the other Penn's Treaty\
        \ -with the Indians. In addition to these specimens of sculpture are also\
        \ displayed, encircled with floral wreaths, the heads of Columbus, Raleigh,\
        \ La Salle, and Cabot ; \u2014 all these pro ductions of the chisel being\
        \ from the hands of Causici and Capellano. In niches on the out side of the\

        \ from the chisel of Persico. Of the paintings four are by Col. John Trumbull,\
        \ one by Weir, one by Vanderlyn, and one by Chapman ; \u2014 the order for\
        \ the remaining vacancy not having yet been filled. The subjects of Trumbull's\
        \ pictures are first, the \" Declaration of Inde pendence\" the essential\
        \ object of which was, to preserve the portraits of the men who were the authors\
        \ of that Declaration. As Col. Trumbull was one of the aids of General Washington\
        \ in the Revolutionary War, he had the best of opportunities for obtaining\
        \ the portraits from the living men, and the consequence is that we have authentic\
        \ likenesses in this picture of the worthies personated. The second of Trumbull's\
        \ pictures represents the \" Surrender of General Burgoyne.\" To the intelligent\
        \ spectator it will tell its own story. The third of the Revolutionary paintings\
        \ represents the \" Surrender of the British Army, commanded by Lord Cornwallis,\
        \ at York-town, in Virginia.\" This picture contains the portraits of the\
        \ principal officers of America, France and England. The fourth and last of\
        \ Trumbull's paintings represents the \" Resignation of General Washing ton\
        \ at Annapolis. The subjects of the remaining pictures are the \" Embarkation\
        \ of the Pilgrims from Leyden,\" by Weir; the \" Landing of Columbus,\" by\
        \ Vanderlyn ; and the \" Baptism of Pocahontas,\" by Chapman. As these illustrate\
        \ scenes connected with the very earliest history of our country, none but\
        \ the leading figures are to be considered in the aspect of authentic portraits.\
        \ The Congressional Library is unquestionably one of the chief attractions\
        \ of the Capitol. The principal room, of which there are three, faces the\
        \ west, and is a large and handsome affair, ninety-two feet long, thirty-four\
        \ wide, and thirty-six high ; divided into twelve alcoves, ornamented with\
        \ fluted pilasters, and in every direction are displayed portraits and busts,\
        \ cases of medals and other works of art. The number of volumes which it contains\
        \ is about 50,000, and the catalogue, which is arranged on the system of Lord\
        \ Bacon, comprises the following table of chapters : Ancient History, Modern\
        \ History, of all the countries of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, American\

        \ Capitol, was founded upon one which was purchased by Congress, in 1814,\
        \ of Thomas Jefferson, for $23,000. The yearly average increase is about 1,800\
        \ volumes. The sum of $5,000 is annually appropriated by Congress for miscellaneous\
        \ books, and $1,000 for law books. In 1851 the library lost many valuable\

        \ at the Literary and Phdosophical Institution rooms, in the Corn Exchange,\

        \ Many valuable and instructing books were presented to Mr. Fredrick Munroe,\

        \ proportioned, and of exceedingly correct formation. We believe that Mr.\
        \ Dugdale is about to engrave upon a steel plate not larger than a sixpence,\
        \ the whole of the Lord's Prayer, the writing of which, on paper within so\
        \ small a space, as has hitherto been considered a work of great merit. Let\

        \ the Blackburn Standard of Wednesday, June 10th, 1835. Energy of mind. \u2014\
        \ It appears to us that energy of mind, like strength of body, must be acquired\
        \ by exercise, and that the consciousness of desert in encountering difficulties,\
        \ must be felt to enable us to accomplish any great work. It is essential\
        \ to success that a young man should study to acquire confidence in his own\
        \ powers. This is a condition of mind entirely different from conceit. It\
        \ exhibits in a secret resolution to make great efforts by persevering aid,\
        \ to gain the object of his ambition. The man of genius is not to be considered\
        \ a plodding fellow ; to the contrary, the genuine man of genius and talent,\
        \ does everything by a sudden act which costs nothing but an effort of mind,\
        \ steadily persevered in. All eminent men have been distinguished by fixing\
        \ upon some great and interesting object, and possessing themselves with such\
        \ a lively conception of it, has led them on through years of tod, in pursuit\
        \ of their favourite object Mr. Joseph Hodgson, the Blackburn Poet, was born\
        \ at Rishton, January 13th, 1783, and was aged ten years when Louis, King\
        \ of France was guillotined, at the revolution of 1793. He is now librarian\
        \ to the Blackburn Mechanics' Institution for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,\
        \ and cultivates the art of poetry with great success. The poetry is deserving\
        \ of great praise, and evinces considerable talent. It is hoped that the natives\
        \ of the town will value him as a genius springing up amongst them of no ordinary\
        \ caste. We hope they will reflect credit upon him for their pathos and beauty.\
        \ His poems are exceedingly sentimental, and written with great spirit and\
        \ freedom of verse. They are as follows : \u2014 \" The Poet's Memorial of\
        \ Respect to Sir Robert Peel;\" \"The Poor Man's Lamentation for the Death\
        \ of Sir Robert Peel ;\" \" The Baptism ;\" \" A Chanson on Queen A^ictoria,\
        \ and her Visit to Manchester in 1851 ;\" \"A new song on the Pope's Arrogance\
        \ and Papal Aggres sion.\" Many others are in his possession, which, it is\
        \ hoped, will be published in a neat volume ; and as he is deserving of being\
        \ encouraged by those now living, they ought to feel a sympathy for him, as\
        \ he is getting on far in years. We have had the pleasure of conversing with\
        \ him personally, and have to say that he possesses a library of rare, singular,\
        \ and curious old and valuable books, which he has collected together for\
        \ many years. He is very intelligent, and is endowed with knowledge of a superior\

    - ['240 PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS, B.C. 284-246. Chap. vi. At the head of this library
        had been Demetrius Pha- Hieronym. lereus, who, after ruling Athens with great
        praise, was inDan.xi. banished from his country, and fled to Ptolemy Soter,
        under whom he consoled himself for the loss of power Cicero, in the enjoyment
        of literary leisure. He was at the same Brutus- time the most learned and
        the most polished of orators. He brought learning from the closet into the
        forum, and, by the soft turn which he gave to public speaking, made that sweet
        and lovely which had before been grave and severe. Cicero thought him the
        great master in the art of speaking, and seems to have taken him as the model
        upon which he wished to form his own style. Suidas. He wrote upon philosophy,
        history, government, and poetry; but the only one of his works which has reached
        our time is his treatise on elocution ; and the careful thought which he there
        gives to the choice of words and to the form of a sentence, and even the parts
        of a sentence, shows the value then set upon style. Indeed he seems rather
        to have charmed his hearers by the softness of his words than to have roused
        them to noble Plutarch., deeds by the strength of his thoughts. He not only
        apophtheg. advised Ptolemy Soter what books he should buy, but which he should
        read, and he chiefly recommended those on government and policy ; and it is
        alike to the credit of the king and of the librarian that he put be fore him
        books which, from their praise of freedom and hatred of tyrants, few persons
        would even speak of in Diogenes the presence of a king. But Demetrius had
        also been consulted by Soter about the choice of a successor, and had given
        his opinion that the crown ought to be left to his eldest son, and that wars
        would arise between his children if it were not so left ; hence we can hardly
        wonder that, on the death of Soter, Demetrius should have lost his place at
        the head of the Museum, and Ckero, been ordered to leave Alexandria. According
        to one nrn Knninn -. _ _ _ pro a ino. account was put to death by the bite

        Rhodes, had been, like Erato- sthenes, a hearer of Callimachus. His only work
        which we now know is his Argonautics, a poem on the voyage of Jason to Colchis
        in search of the golden fleece. It is a regular epic poem, in imitation of
        Homer, and, like other imitations, it wants the interest which hangs upon
        reality of manners and story in the Iliad. Aristo- Quintiiian., phanes and
        his pupil Aristarchus, the great critics of lb'' x'' L the day, with whose
        judgment few dared to disagree, and who had perhaps quarrelled with the poet,
        de clared that it was not poetry ; and after that, the most that Quintilian
        would say for it was that it ought not to be overlooked, and that it never
        falls below medio crity. It is not wanting in graceful expressions and well-turned
        sentences, but it possesses no depth of feeling or happy boldness of thought,
        and Longinus dismisses it with the cold praise of being free from fault. Suidas,
        His master Callimachus showed his dislike of his chus. young rival by hurling
        against him a reproachful poem, in which he speaks of him under the name of
        an Ibis. This is now lost, but it was copied by Ovid in his poem of the same
        name ; and from the Roman we can gather something of the dark and learned
        style in wdiich Cal limachus threw out his biting reproaches. We do not know
        from what this quarrel arose, but it seems to have been the cause of Apollonius
        leaving Alexandria. He removed to Rhodes, where he taug-ht in the schools
        during all the reign of Philopator, till he was recalled by Epiphanes, and
        made librarian of the Museum in his old age, on the death of Eratosthenes.
        Suidas. Lycophron, the tragic writer, lived about this time at Alexandria,
        and was one of the seven men of letters sometimes called the Alexandrian Pleiades,
        though writers are not agreed upon the names which fill up the list. His tragedies
        are all lost, and the only work of his which we now have is the dark and muddy
        poem', 1]

    - ['241 THE MUSEUM. Soon after this we find Zenodotus of Ephesus filling Chap,
        vi the office of librarian to the Museum. He was a poet, suidas. who, with
        others, had been employed by Soter in the education of his children. He is
        also known as the first of those Alexandrian critics who turned their thoughts
        towards mending the text of Homer, and to whom we are indebted for the tolerably
        correct state of the great poet''s works, which had become faulty through
        the carelessness of the copiers. Zenodotus was soon fol lowed by other critics
        in this task of editing Homer. But their labours were not approved of by all
        ; and Diogenes in when Aratus asked Timon which he thought the best edition
        of the poet, the philosopher shrewdly answered, '' That which has been least
        corrected.'' At the head of the mathematical school was Euclid ; who is, however,
        less known to us by what his pupils have said of him than by his own invaluable
        work on geometry. This is one of the few of the scientific writings of the
        ancients that have come down to us. The discoveries of the man of science
        are made use of by his successor, and the discoverer perhaps loses part of
        his reward when his writings are passed by, after they have served us as a
        stepping-stone to mount by. If he wishes his works to live with those of the
        poet and orator, he must, like them, cultivate those beauties of style which
        are fitted to his matter. Euclid did so ; and the Elements have been for more
        than two thou sand years the model for all writers on geometry. He begins
        at the beginning, and leads the learner, step by step, from the simplest propositions,
        called axioms, which rest upon metaphysical rather than mathematical proof,
        to high geometrical truths. The mind is indeed sometimes wearied by being
        made to stop at every single step in the path, and wishes with Ptolemy Soter
        for a shorter road ; but, upon the whole, Euclid''s neat- ness and clearness
        have never been equalled. The Proclus, writings of Hippocrates, Eudoxus, Leon,

        \ have been informed to-day of the origin ofthe appli cation. I have had a\
        \ curiosity to ascertain the meaning of the term. It is well known to many\
        \ that Anvers is the French pronunciation of Antwerp, a once flourishing city\
        \ of Netherlands, and still possessing magnitude and importance. By the kind\
        \ assistance of Mr. Sibley, the Assistant Librarian of Harvard, I have been\
        \ directed to an old geo graphical folio, in which the signification of the\
        \ name is discussed. The opinion of the most judicious antiquarians is there\
        \ stated. Aen werp, from which Antwerp is derived, is an old Flemish word\
        \ denoting addition, accession, progress. The waters of the river Scheldt,\
        \ on whose banks it is situated, carried down a large quantity of alluvial\
        \ material, which they deposited on the site of Antwerp, and laid the foundation\
        \ of the city. The soil on which it stands is added to the natural soil \u2014\
        \ thence the name. It was applied to us with a kind of prophetic intimation.\
        \ We accept it as our motto, and as indicative of our condition. Addition,\
        \ \u2014 gradual, steady addition, \u2014 like the deposits which a river\
        \ makes of the soil which is diffused through its waters, \u2014 a rich addition,\
        \ as all alluvial soil is known to be. Addition to our agricultural resources,\
        \ \u2014 addition to arts and trade, \u2014 progress in re sources, wealth,\
        \ industry, enterprise, virtue, humanity, the spirit and principles of religion,\
        \ and every element that contributes to elevate, adorn, and bless a Town,\
        \ State, and Nation. The river of our pros perity, which flows down from the\
        \ past, continues to make its constant, silent deposit of the selectest materials,\
        \ enlarging, deepening, enriching the foundations on which we hope to stand\
        \ till the end of time. There is one respect in which we claim not only to\
        \ have made a great advance, but to stand before the age. I refer to the great\
        \ subject of Demonology and spiritual communica tions. Whatever there is in\
        \ spiritual manifestations, either by rapping or turning over tables, that\
        \ is supposed to indicate progress in this world or the other, we can exhibit\

        \ us that in his youth he could repeat 100 ver ses after having once read\
        \ them. It is said that Dr. Leyden had so strong a memory, that he could repeat\

        \ placed behind a screen, when Voltaire came to read him a new poem of considerable\
        \ length. The gentleman afterwards perplexed the poet by asserting, in jest,\
        \ that the poem was his, and repeating it word for word as a proof of the\
        \ truth of his assertion. Locke in his description of memory (which description,\
        \ as Campbell observes, is \" absolutely poetical,\"*) mentions that it is\
        \ recorded of \" that prodigy of parts, Monsieur Pascal, that till the decay\
        \ of his health had impaired his memory, he forgot nothing of what he had\
        \ done, read, or thought in any part of his rational age.\" It is said that\
        \ the admirable Crichton was similarly gifted, and could repeat backwards\
        \ any speech he had made. Magliabecchi, the Florentine Librarian, could recollect\
        \ whole volumes, ancl once supplied an author from memory with a copy of his\

        \ without books, he could refer to a particular subject in them, and write\
        \ as fully on it as another man would with all his books about him. Woodfell's\

        \ hear patiently of liberties and privileges it did not enjoy. These aspirations\
        \ for equality first, perhaps, broke out into audible complaints in the year\
        \ 1753. The country was in so thriving a state that there was a surplus revenue\
        \ after payment of all charges. The house of commons determined to apply this\
        \ to the liquidation of a debt. The government, though not unwilling to admit\
        \ of such an application, maintained that the whole revenue belonged to the\
        \ king, and could not be disposed of without his previous consent. In England,\
        \ where the grants of parliament are appropriated according to estimates,\
        \ such a question could hardly arise; nor would there, I presume, be the slightest\
        \ doubt as to the control of the house of commons over a surplus income. But\
        \ in Ireland, the practice of appropriation seems never to have prevailed,\
        \ at least so strictly; and the constitutional right might perhaps not unreasonably\
        \ be disputed. After long and violent discussions, wherein the speaker of\
        \ the commons and other eminent men bore a leading part on the popular side,\
        \ the crown was so far victorious as to procure some motions to be carried\
        \ , which seemed to imply its authority; but the house took care, by more\
        \ special applications of the revenue, to prevent the recurrence of an undisposed\
        \ surplus. From this era the great parliamentary history of Ireland begins,\
        \ and is terminated after half a century by the union: a period fruitful of\
        \ splendid eloquence, and of ardent, though not always uncomprising, patriotism.\

        \ literature and art, of which being deprived , he accounted these de privations\
        \ not among the least of the many he now endured. Mr. Upcott has also a note\
        \ of Charles to Secretary Nicholas, at the time the King was with the Scots,\
        \ in which he orders certain volumes to be sent to him, and points out their\
        \ particular situation in one of his apartments at Whitehall. There was an\
        \ interval, a short interval, between the dissolution of the third Parlia\
        \ ment in 1G28, and the rising troubles in Scotland in 1G38, when we may describe\
        \ the King as at peace with himself, as no longer daily harassed by a discontented\
        \ Parliament, and as yet a stranger to ad versities unparalleled in the history\
        \ of princes. During these ten years, Charles indulged more uninterruptedly\
        \ a passion for the arts of imagination. Picture, sculpture, archi tecture,\
        \ and music, and not less literature, charmed these few happier years. Nor\
        \ were these tastes a late acquirement with Charles the First: they were no\
        \ feeble pursuit, taken up as the resource of the idler; \u2014 no cold reflected\
        \ taste, caught up from others. They were the virgin fancies of his studious\
        \ days; and when banished from them, in his wan derings, and in the camp or\
        \ in the prison, they still occupied his musings. Many evidences of such recollections\
        \ still exist. I have seen a written order by Charles the First, when in confinement\
        \ in the Isle of Wight, addressed to the learned Patrick Young, his librarian,\
        \ about the bocks at St. James's, and to the great antiquary, Sir Symonds\
        \ D'Ewes, the keeper of his medals, concerning their respective objects; The\
        \ domestic habits of this Sovereign seem ennobled by their intellectual refine\
        \ ment. Ingenious himself in all the arts of ingenuity, his sensibility to\
        \ art was that of an artist, his critical discernment that of the connoisseur.\
        \ With some Monarchs, pride or pomp have shed a golden patronage over Art,\
        \ as over one of their lesser glories: with Charles the First, the passion\
        \ was the devotion of a votary, loving Art only for itself. Though avowedly\
        \ neither a painter nor a poet, he could handle the pencil and compose a verse.\
        \ He suggested subjects to the two great painters of his age, to his great\
        \ architect, and to dramatic poets. Se cret history only reveals this softening\

        David Shumway, Truman Ste phens, Enoch Bush and Horatio G. Hough, were chosen
        its first trustees. A good selection of about two hundred vol umes was made,
        and the library was continued till the spring of 1835, when it was broken
        up and distributed among its remaining shareholders. Asa L. Sheldon, was for
        many of the later years the librarian. A wooden building two stories high
        and furnished with a small cupola, was built in the village in 1828, for an
        academic school and probably with the ultimate design of obtain ing an incorporation.
        The expense waa defrayed by sub scription, and the property was to be managed
        by trustees elected by the contributors. The first Trustees were Rev. David

        \ instant across his mind, that he once, as a reward for some excellent lessons,\
        \ had bought, and given to his little Tullia, a tiny paper-knife much like\
        \ this, and on which he had had engraved J. R. to C. W. It was a present which\

        was destitute of helps in the wild woods amid which I passed the earlier part

        more than he talked of it, and was saving up every penny he could spare for
        that purpose; but his object was not to build a country-house for himself,
        but a more commodious hermitage for his old benefactors. Steadily keeping

        accustomed to border warfare, knew better bow to cope with a savage foe.*

        of the artillery, ammunition, and other stores were destroyed. It was not
        until the thirteenth that the general uttered a word, except for military
        directions. He then bestoAved the warmest praise on his gallant officers,

        \ service was not re quired. A very full table of historical works, general\
        \ and local, precedes the opening pages of this volume, which, it is thought,\
        \ will be found of great convenience. A supplementary list of towns and plantations\
        \ in Northern Maine, containing such information respecting their history,\
        \ condition, and fitness for settlement, as could be obtained from sources\
        \ most worthy of credit, follows immediately after the towns of Vermont. To\
        \ this succeeds, in the form of Appendixes, a list of Post-Offices not found\
        \ in the body of the work ; a table of the Lights upon the coast, with a complete\
        \ description of the same ; Epitaphs of several distinguished men ; lists\
        \ of the Sena tors and Representatives in Congress from each State during\
        \ the whole period of its history ; also of Governors, and Electors of President\
        \ ; of Gubernatorial, Presi dential, and Electoral Votes ; and tables showing\
        \ the Number of Electoral Votes and the Ratio of Representation. The Illustrations\
        \ are, with not more than half a dozen exceptions, made from original ambrotypes\
        \ or photographs, recently taken expressly for the work, the drawing and engraving\
        \ of which were committed to the most competent and faith ful artists ; and\
        \ it is believed that those best acquainted with the respective locali ties\
        \ here portrayed will testify to their accuracy. The Maps have been projected\
        \ with great care from the most recent surveys. The triangulations of the\
        \ United States Coast Survey were scrupulously followed in delineating the\
        \ coast line, and the drawings were submitted to men best able to point out\
        \ their errors and pass upon their correctness. The general topographical\
        \ execution, the fulness of detail, and the neatness of the engravings, it\
        \ is hoped, will be a sufficient evidence of their accuracy. The authors gratefully\
        \ acknowledge the important aid received from gentlemen in all parts of their\

        \ the third and fourth piers, are the sepulchral slabs which cover the remains\
        \ of Bishop Trimnel, who died in 1723 ; and Dean Trimnel, his brother, who\
        \ died six years later.1 Here we conclude our survey of the interior of the\
        \ cathedral,2 and proceed by the ancient wooden staircase in the terminal\
        \ aisle of the south transept, through a doorway just over the entrance from\
        \ the dark cloister, to the Cathedral Library. This room is built over the\
        \ cloister, with a modem roof leaning against the transept wall.3 This room\
        \ was built (according to Gale4) in 1668 ; and it is divided into two parts\
        \ ; the larger one, to the east of the lobby, is the Library ; and the smaller\
        \ one, to the west, was originally the Audit House, and more recently the\
        \ choristers' schoolroom.5 The Library is a long, low room, with oaken presses\
        \ curiously carved, and orna mented with gilded knobs, after the fashion of\
        \ the latter half of the seventeenth century. It contains a collection of\
        \ from between three and four thousand volumes,5 principally on divinity,\
        \ and the larger part of them the gift of Bishop Morley. These works are accessible\
        \ to the clergy of the diocese by application to the canon in resi dence ;\
        \ and a book is kept in which borrowers enter their names and the titles of\
        \ the books they take. The Bodleian Library Catalogue is used, and there is\
        \ another catalogue for works not contained in that. There is also a volume\
        \ in which gifts and bequests to the Library are recorded.7 Besides the books,\
        \ there are some exceedingly curious and valuable MSS., among which are \u2014\
        \ (1) In the nave, near the second arch on the north side, is the following\
        \ inscription : \u2014 (4) P. 37. (5) This school having been discontinued,\
        \ the room is (I am informed by the present librarian, Mr. Garrett) about\
        \ to be added to the Library, the additions to the col lections of books requiring\
        \ more space. The doors of this room are formed of parts of the monstrous\
        \ and gorgeous Jacobean canopy which, until the restorations, concealed the\
        \ centre of the magnificent reredos. \"Filionatu maxima, Prancisco Gulielmo\

        it from the park. The church stands at the south-eastern angle, and an ambulatory,
        or cloister, with the infirmary over it, extending from the north transept
        to the porter''s lodge, forms the eastern side. To the south of the buildings
        is the park, and close to the church the cemetery ; on the east is the Master''s
        garden ; and on the west are the gardens of the brethren, and another garden
        belonging to the Master. To the north of the hospital, beside the high road,
        is a small village, which has sprung up, in the course of centuries, appa
        rently in consequence of the charity. The architecture1 of the outer gate
        presents no features requiring remark, but the entrance to the quadrangle
        is by a noble gateway and massive tower, quite worthy of the name of Beaufort.
        The arches are good, four-centred arches, rather flat, but well moulded, without
        shafts, and the outer one has rich spandrels with shields. Three string-courses
        beneath the stories of the tower are ornamented with bosses, alter nately
        busts.3 and foliage. A plain square-headed window, of two lights, and divided
        by a transom, on each front, lights what is called the " Founder''s Chamber."
        The upper story, on the outer side, displays three elegantly tabernacled niches
        ; and in that on the left there still remains the figure of the cardinal kneeling
        in prayer.3 Only one niche4 appears on the side next the quadrangle, and it
        is now empty. The chamber is lighted by several small windows on the south
        front and sides. The parapet is quite plain, as is the string-course beneath
        it, but the buttresses have gables with crockets and finials. A handsome octagonal
        turret at the south west angle, accessible by a low arched doorway from the
        quadrangle, contains a spiral stair, and rises boldly above the roof, giving
        " much character to the outline."5 The vault of the gateway is richly groined,
        the central boss displaying " fruit and foliage in the shape of a cross."
        On the eastern side is the porter''s lodge, in the wall of which one of the
        masters, Robert Sherburne, has inserted his favourite motto, " DiLExi sapientiam,"
        with his initials and the date, 1503. (1) I have found the essay " On the
        Architecture of the Church and Hospital of the Holy Cross," by Mr. E. A. Freeman,
        in the Winchester Vol. of Arch. Instit., a very valuable help in my survey
        and description of this sub ject. I have also used Britton''s "Architectural
        Anti quities;" Dollman''s "Examples of Ancient Domestic Architecture," Part
        II. ; a lecture on " The History and Antiquities of the Hospital of St. Cross,"
        by the Rev. L. M. Humbert, the present Master, to whom I am further indebted
        for much valuable personal assistance and infor mation. I have also to acknowledge
        my obligations to W. T. Alchin, Esq. (Librarian to the City of London Library,
        Guildhall), for the use of his MS. collections relatiug to St. Cross. of the
        cardinal''s predecessor in the see of Winchester, William of Wykeham" (Duthy''s
        "Sketches," p. 278.) (3) It has been conjectured that the central niche was
        occupied by the Holy Cross, and that on the left baud by the figure of the
        first founder of the hospital, Bishop De Blois. (Ibid.) (4) This niche was
        originally occupied by a figure of the Ule9sed Virgin, crowned. Milner (vol.
        ii. p. 184) has given an absurd local story of its being the figure of a woman
        with a milkpail on her head, placed there because the foundation of the hospital
        was suggested to Bishop De Blois by such a woman, whom he casually met in
        the meadows hard by its present site. This figure, "more than three-quarters
        of a century" ago, " fell accidentally to the ground, and nearly crushed oue
        of the brethren in its fall " (Ibid. ; Duthy''8 " Sketches," p. 280). (2)
        "Amongst them, it is said, are represented the cardinal''s father, ''old John
        of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,'' Henry IV., Henry V., and probably also
        Henry VI., together with his accomplished, undaunted, and unfortunate ques

    - ["102 HISTORY OF HAMPSHIRE. Next after Walkelyn's, however, William of Wykeham's\
        \ name is most closely connected with Winchester Cathedral. We have spoken\
        \ so fully of his work in our description,1 that we shall need to do no more\
        \ in this place than recapitulate out former statements, and refer to Professor\
        \ Willis's copious account of the alterations effected by him, and the manner\
        \ in which they were accomplished.2 William of Wykeham's work. All the piers\
        \ of the nave were cut away or recased, and thus transformed from the Norman\
        \ to the Perpendicular style ; the circular arches were removed, and the present\
        \ lofty arches erected, the Norman trisoria being replaced by the pierced\
        \ parapets over the arches, which are merely ornamental in their character\
        \ ; and Perpendicular windows were substituted for the plain round-headed\
        \ Norman windows within the aisles and the clerestories, and lierne vaults\
        \ thrown over both the aisles and body of the nave. It is quite certain that\
        \ all this was not completed at Wykeham's death ; and the portions which were\
        \ left for his successors to complete, appear to have been the piers on the\
        \ north side of the nave, all the windows,3 and the upper part of the walls\
        \ and the vault of the body of the church.4 But the design and the plan of\
        \ the operations were Wykeham's, and to him, therefore, this extensive alteration\
        \ and improvement is justly attributed.5 There are no means of determining\
        \ exactly when much, which must be placed after Wykeham's time, and before\
        \ the times of Hunton, Fox, and Silkstede, was done. The next definitively\
        \ fixed event in our story is the lengthening of the Lady Chapel,6 by Priors\
        \ Hunton and Silkstede, \"between 1470 and 1524.\"7 \"The Norman side-aisles\
        \ of the presbytery were taken down and replaced by the present ones, in imitation\
        \ of Wykeham's aisles in the nave, by Bishop Fox and Prior Silkstede, between\
        \ 1-500 and 1528. The side screens of the presbytery were also erected in\
        \ 1524. \"8 Most of what we have described as Perpendicular in the former\
        \ part of this section must be regarded as the work of this period, but we\
        \ have no means of deter mining the dates more exactly. Works of Bishop Fox,\

        \ the Perpendicular style is said not to have com menced till about 1377,\
        \ this statement needs to be guarded. Edington's chantry (as described above,\
        \ p. 67, note 3 ) confirms the conclusions maintained in this note. The wood-work\
        \ of the stalls in the choir ought to be ascribed to Edington's time. (See\

        \ Wykeham's Registers contain a mine of highly curious and interesting information\

        \ would elucidate many of the knotty points in this architectural history.\
        \ (6) See pp. 42, 64 to 66, above. The style of the ex ternal arcade round\
        \ the lower part of this prolongation of the Lady Chapel, would seem to point\
        \ to an earlier date, but in the present state of our documentary in formation\
        \ we must regard this as of the date given above. And it must be carefully\
        \ remembered, that whilst an earlier style may be, and often is, imitated,\
        \ the imitation of a later style is an absolute impossibility. (7) Willis,\

        \ \"the Georgian, or Iberian monastery,\" one of the largest monasteries in\
        \ the peninsula, according to Webber Smith, and Mr. Curzon says of it, that\
        \ it might almost be denominated a small fortified town (See p. 129), so numerous\
        \ are the buildings and courts which are contained within its encircling wall.\
        \ It is situated near the sea, and in its general form is nearly square, with\
        \ four or five square towers pro jecting from the walls. On each of the four\
        \ sides there are rooms for above two hundred monks. I did not learn precisely\
        \ how many were then inhabiting it, but I should imagine there were above\
        \ a hundred. As, however, many of the members of all the religious communities\
        \ on Mount Athos are employed in culti- vating the numerous farms which they\
        \ possess, it is probable that not more than one-half of the monks are in\
        \ residence at any one time. The monastery was founded by Theophania (Theo\
        \ dora 1), wife of the Emperor Romanus, the son of Leo Sophos,1 or the Philosopher,\
        \ between the years 919 and 922. It was restored by a Prince of Georgia or\
        \ Iberia, and enlarged by his son, a caloyer. The church is dedicated to the\
        \ \"repose of the Virgin.\" It has four or five domes, and is of considerable\
        \ size, standing by itself, as usual, in the centre of the great court, and\
        \ is ornamented with columns and other decorations of rich marbles, together\
        \ with the usual fresco paintings on the walls. The library is a remarkably\
        \ fine one, perhaps alto gether the most precious of all those which now remain\
        \ on the holy mountain. It is situated over the porch of the church, which\
        \ appears to be the usual place where the books are kept in these establishments.\
        \ The room is of good size, well fitted up with bookcases with glass doors,\
        \ of not veiy old workmanship. I should imagine that about a hundred years\
        \ ago, some agou menos, or prior, or librarian, must have been a reading man\
        \ ; and the pious care which he took to arrange the ancient volumes of the\
        \ monastery has been rewarded by the excellent state of preservation in which\
        \ they still remain. Since his time, they have probably remained undisturbed.\
        \ Everyone could see through the greenish uneven panes of old glass that there\
        \ was nothing but books inside, and therefore nobody meddled with them. I\
        \ was allowed to rummage at my leisure in this mine of arch\xE6ological treasure.\
        \ Having taken up my abode for the time being in a cheerful room, the windows\
        \ of which commanded a glorious prospect, I soon made friends with the literary\
        \ portion of the community, which consisted of one thin old monk, a cleverish\
        \ man, who united to many other offices that of librarian. He was also secretary\
        \ to my lord the agoumenos, a kind hearted old gentleman, who seemed to wish\
        \ everybody well, and who evidently liked much better to sit still on his\
        \ divan than to regulate the affairs of his convent. The rents, the long lists\
        \ of tuns of wine and oil, the strings of mules laden with corn, which came\
        \ in daily from the farms, and all the other complicated details of this mighty\
        \ c\u0153nobium \u2014 over all these, and number less other important matters,\
        \ the thin secretary had full control. Some of the young monks, demure, fat\
        \ youths, came into the library every now and then, and wondered \"Oh !\"\
        \ said the agoumenos, \"take some more;\" and, without more ado, he seized\
        \ upon an unfortunate thick quarto manuscript of tbe Acts and Epistles, and\
        \ draw ing out a knife cut out an inch thickness of leaves at the end before\
        \ I could stop him. It proved to be the Apocalypse, whicli concluded the volume,\
        \ but which is rarely found in early Greek manuscripts of the Acts : it was\
        \ of the eleventh century. I ought, perhaps, to have slain the tomecide for\
        \ his dreadful act of profana tion, but his generosity reconciled me to his\
        \ guilt, so I pocketed the Apocalypse, and asked him if he would sell me any\
        \ of the other boobs, as he did not appear-to set any particular value upon\
        \ them. \"Malista, certainly,\" he repbed; \"how many will you have ? They\
        \ are of no use to me, and as I am in want of money to complete my buildings\
        \ I shaU be very glad to turn them to some account.\" After a good deal of\
        \ conversation, finding the agou menos so accommodating, and so desirous to\
        \ part with the contents of his dark and dusty closet, I arranged that I would\
        \ leave him for the present, and after I had made the tour of the other monasteries,\
        \ would return to Caracalla, and take up my abode there until I could hire\
        \ a vessel, or make some other arrangements for my return to Constantinople.\
        \ Satisfactory as this arrange ment was, I nevertheless resolved to make sure\
        \ of what I had already got, so I packed them up carefully in the great saddlebags,\
        \ to my extreme delight. The agou menos kindly furnished me with fresh mules,\
        \ and in the afternoon I proceeded to tbe monastery of Philotheo, which is\
        \ only an hour's ride from Caracalla, and stands in a little field surrounded\
        \ by the forest. It is distant from the sea about four miles, and is protected,\
        \ like all the others, by a high stone wall surrounding the whole of the building.\
        \ The church is curious and interesting ; it is ornamented with representations\
        \ of saints, and holy men in fresco, upon the walls of the interior and in\
        \ the porch. I could not make out when it was built, but probably before the\
        \ twelfth century. Arsenius, Philotheus, and Dionysius were the founders,\
        \ but who they were did not appear. The monastery was re paired, and the refectory\
        \ enlarged and painted, in the year 1492, by Leontius, o Pao-iXevs Kax^iov,\
        \ and bis son Alexander. I was shown the reliquaries, but they were not remarkable.\
        \ Tbe monks said they had no library; and there being nothing of interest\
        \ in tbe monastery, I determined to go on. Indeed the expres sion of the faces\
        \ of some of these monks was so unpre possessing, and their manners so rude,\
        \ although not absolutely uncivil, that I did not feel any particular inclination\
        \ to remain amongst them, so leaving a small donation for the church, I mounted\

        \ less than two years. This period is divided into four terms ; during which\
        \ residence is indispensable. The first term com mences about the 25th of\

        pre sident of the Antiquarian Society, to which he gave a considerable number
        of books and manuscripts. Edmund Law, the next bishop, was a native of Lan
        cashire, being born at Cartmel in that county in 1703. He received his early
        education at Cartmel and Kendal, and afterwards entered St. John''s College,
        Cambridge, from which he removed to Christ''s College, where he obtained a
        feUowship. In 1737 he was presented by the university to the living of Greystoke,
        and in 1743 was appointed archdeacon of Carlisle by Bishop Flem ing ; and
        as the archdeaconry has the rectory of Salkeld annexed to it, he went to reside
        there in 1746. In 1754 he took the degree of D.D., and two years after wards
        he was elected master of Peter House, upon which he resigned his office of
        archdeacon. About 1760 he received the appointment of head librarian of the
        uni versity. He subsequently became archdeacon of Staf fordshire, prebendary
        of Lichfield, and in 1767 received a prebendal staU in Durham Cathedral. He
        was elected bishop of Carlisle in the following year, and held the see till
        1787, when he died at Rose Castle on the 14th of August, in his eighty-fourth
        year. He was buried in his cathedral. During his residence in Christ''s Col
        lege he pubUshed a translation of Archbishop King''s " Essay on the Origin
        of Evil," with notes, and pre pared for the press an edition of Stephen''s
        " Thesaurus." He also formed an acquaintance with several literary celebrities,
        among others the learned Dr. Jortin, Dr. Taylor, the editor of Lysias and
        Demosthenes, and Dr. Waterton, the master of Magdalene College. In 1734 or
        1735 he published an " Inquiry into the Ideas of Space, Time," &c ; and while
        resident at Salkeld his " Considerations on the Theory of Reli gion." About
        1777 he edited Locke''s works, which he published in three volumes quarto,
        with a preface and life of the author. Bishop Law devoted a great portion
        of his time to metaphysical studies, and is said to have held the writings
        of Locke in the highest esteem. " He was distinguished by a mild and tranquil
        dis position, and the amenity of his manners endeared him to all who knew
        him. His countenance always wore the same kind aud composed aspect, truly
        indicating the calmness and benignity of his temper." He was succeeded in
        the see of Carlisle by became tutor to Lord Pulteney, with whom he travelled
        for some time, and, in recognition of his services, was rewarded by the Earl
        of Bath with considerable church preferment. He was consecrated bishop of
        CarUsle in 1 787, having previously held the dignities of canon and dean of
        Windsor. In 3 79 J he was translated to Salis bury, and died the 18th May,
        1807. Bishop Douglas held the office of chancellor of the most noble order
        of the garter, was a fellow of the Royal Society, a vice president of the
        Antiquarian Society, and a trustee of the British Museum. The next bishop
        was The Hon. Edward Venables Vernon, who was ap pointed on the translation
        of Bishop Douglas, at which time he was canon of Christ Church, Oxford. This
        prelate, the second son of George, Lord Vernon, was born on the 10th of October,
        1757, educated at West minster School, and afterwards removed to Christ Church,
        Oxford. He subsequently became Fellow of All Souls'' College, chaplain to
        the king, prebendary of Gloucester, and canon of Christ Church. In 1791 he
        was appointed to the bishopric of Carlisle, and upon inheriting the Harcourt
        estates, assumed the surname of Harcourt. In 1808, Bishop Harcourt was translated
        to York, and the see was offered to Dr. Thomas Zouch, prebendary of Durham,
        who declined to accept it, in consequence of his advanced age and retired
        habits. Samuel Goodenough was elected bishop on the 26th of January, 1808,

        of the Royal and Linnean Societies, and one of the council of the first named

        as a member of Trinity Col lege, and graduated M.A. in 1805, but subsequently
        placed his name on the boards of St. John''s College. Having married a daughter
        of Archbishop Manners Sutton, he was by him collated, in the year 1809, to
        the rectories of Bishopbourne and Ivychurch. He sub sequently became, in 1811,

        \ room was subsequently added. This institution possesses the books, coins,\
        \ t&c, left to the inhabitants of Penrith by the late Mr. Harrison AVilkinson,\
        \ who, iu his will expressed a hope that the contribution would induce some\
        \ person with competent means to found a public library on an adequate scale,\
        \ the want of which in early life he had experienced, and which was still\
        \ wanted for the advancement of education. The British School, erected in\
        \ 1847, is situated in Canny Croft. It was erected by subscription and a government\
        \ grant in 1847, on a site given by the Duke of Devonshire, and consists of\
        \ one large room, with two class-rooms, and a good playground. The school\
        \ was opened in 1848. It is under government inspection, and has an average\
        \ attendance of seventy children. The Penrith Book Society and the Gentlemen's\
        \ News Room have been in existence many years. A Ragged School was commenced\
        \ at the Town Head iu August, 1853, and is now attended by forty children.\
        \ The Young Men's Christian Association Public Library was founded in 1853,\
        \ and has for its object \"to bring into circulation among young men the best\
        \ works in sacred literature.\" The ordinary subscription is 6s. per annum,\
        \ apprentices of limited means, 4s. The library contains about 300 volumes.\
        \ In connection with this association are classes for the study of Biblical\
        \ literature, and lectures. In addition to these schools there are Sunday-schools\
        \ attached to the various places of worship. RELIGIOUS, CHARITABLE, AND OTHER\
        \ SOCIETIES. The Penrith Church Missionary Association, and a branch of the\
        \ British and Foreign Bible Society were established in 1815, and have continued\
        \ in operation ever since. The Working Men's Reading Room was established\
        \ in 1853, on the model of a similar institution in Car lisle, whose rule\
        \ \" that no member who is not a working man, or who is able to live independently\
        \ of his labour, shall be eligible to vote at any of the society's meetings,\
        \ to hold office, or to sit upon any committee,\" is followed here. Each member\
        \ pays an entrance fee of sixpence, a penny a week subscription, and an annual\
        \ levy of sixpence. On the formation of this institution, the members took\
        \ the old Catholic chapel for their news room and library ; and shortly afterwards\
        \ set about erecting a building more suitable for their purpose. An appeal\
        \ was made to the public, and \xA3350 was soon obtained. Ground was at once\
        \ purchased, and a building erected at a cost of about \xA3050. The new structure,\
        \ The Good Samaritan Society was established here many years ago, by the Wesleyans,\
        \ for the purpose of administering relief to destitute persons, without dis\
        \ tinction of religion or country. An Agricultural Society was established\
        \ at Penrith about twenty-seven years ago. The show is held annually in September.\
        \ A farmers' club was also established here about a dozen years ago, in connection\
        \ with which there is a library and reading room. The club meets twice a month\
        \ for the discussion of subjects relating to agriculture. The town possesses\
        \ flourishing societies of Free Masons, Oddfellows, Foresters, and Druids,\
        \ which have conferred great and lasting benefits upon Penrith and the surrounding\
        \ district. which is sufficiently large for the holding of lectures, Sic,\
        \ was opened in September, 1855. In connection with the reading room is a\
        \ dwelling house for the librarian. The number of members at present is upwards\
        \ of 200. The library comprises nearly 2,000 volumes. There is also a a Co-operative\
        \ Building Society, formed in October, 1850, after the model of one at Carlisle.\
        \ The amount of each share is \xA330. Since 1850 the society has purchased\
        \ four parcels of building land, which have been allotted to the members.\
        \ The first purchase was Newlands Place, containing one acre and three-quarters,\

        even the fault of exaggeration. But we have since heard that many things are
        not Ger man merely, but continental. In Switzerland we have re lied wholly
        upon the people and their own chronicles. The Swiss are all chroniclers, and
        remarkably faithful in writing of themselves. We have found them always ready
        to open their stores for our researches, and never manifesting any fear of
        our pen. We are particularly indebted to Dr. Prof. Osenbrugg, of Zurich University,
        for a series of observations made by him self in various tours in Switzerland
        to see the country and to write about the people. The descriptions of prisons,
        court trials, and various facts in jurisprudence, were fur nished us by him,
        and we are only sorry that we cannot do justice to the original, in which
        law and poetry are blended in an unusually happy manner. Dr. Oesterler,*of
        the same city, and the librarian of the Biblioteke, were invaluable assistants
        in our studies. The "American Minister Resident," at Berne, furnished us cordially
        with introductions and special passports, to en able us to travel with profit
        and pleasure, and we are espe cially indebted to the firm of "Dalp & Co."
        for any courtesy to facilitate us in our work. Whether we travelled alone,
        or in what sort of company, we do not this time inform the public, as it does
        not essen tially concern them, and we will not subject others to the reproach
        of the evil-minded and vulgar, but may say it is no such marvellous thing
        in these days to travel in any tole rably civilized country. There is sufficient

        There was one carriage, indeed, the horses of which had a sympathy absolutely
        magnetic with the ponies of Lady Rainford''s phaeton. Whenever the latter
        drew up at the librarian''s door, you might feel sure that the more stately
        quadru peds would instantly round the corner, and hurry to the same destination.
        From the richly blazoned vehicle drawn by these sagacious animals, would alight
        a tall, stately, rather over-dressed dame, who generally left her companions
        seated in the carriage. One of these was a lady far advanced in life. She
        looked cheerful and amiable, with her lively but wandering glance, that seemed
        to range with interest over all objects, and to rest upon none. The other
        was a girl, of about twenty, with as pleasant a face as you would wish to
        see ; a rosy face lit by frank blue eyes, and set in a waving frame of golden
        ringlets. But our present concern is with her parent, the lady who has just
        descended, and who is saiUng majesticaUy into the shop. She pretends not to
        see Lady Bainford and Caroline who are engaged with the librarian, and addresses
        her self to his wife. It is to be hoped that the latter is well acquainted
        with the most select phrases in the EngUsh tongue, and with a sprinkling of
        French ones, for her customer uses both. The latter, however, are rather words

        \ to the breadth ofthe sheet. Upon this parawaik, with a pencil of stea tites,\
        \ he keeps his accounts and memorandums. Books in the Pali text are sometimes\
        \ composed of thin stripes of bamboo, deli cately plaited and varnished over\
        \ in such a manner as to form a smooth and hard surface, on a leaf of any\

        \ monastery there is a repository of books, which are usu ally kept in lacquered\
        \ chests. When at the capital, Colonel Symes paid a -visit to the royal library,\
        \ of which he gives us the following interesting description. \"It is,\" says\
        \ he, \"a large brick building, raised on a terrace, and covered by a roof\
        \ of a very compound structure. It consists of one square room, with an en\
        \ closed virando, or gallery, surrounding it. The room was locked, and, as\
        \ we had not a special order for seeing it, the person who had the care of\
        \ the library said that he was not at liberty to open ' the doors, but assured\
        \ us there was nothing in the inside different from what we might see in the\
        \ virando, where a number of large chests, curiously ornamented with gilding\
        \ and japan, were ranged in regular order against tbe wall. I counted fifty;\
        \ but there were many more, probably not less than a hundred. The books were\
        \ regularly classed, and the contents of each chest were written in gold letters\
        \ on the lid. The librarian opened two, and showed me some very beautiful\
        \ writing, on thin leaves of ivory, the margins of which were ornamented with\
        \ flowers of gold, neatly executed. I saw also some books written in the ancient\
        \ Pali, \"the religious text. Every thing seemed to be arranged with perfect\
        \ regularity; and I was informed that there were books on divers subjects;\
        \ more on divinity than any other; but history, music, medicine, painting,\
        \ and romance, had their separate trea tises. The volumes were disposed under\
        \ distinct heads, regularly numbered; and if all the other chests were as\
        \ well-filled as those that were submitted to our inspection, it is not improbable\
        \ that his Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any potentate\
        \ from the banks of the Danube to the borders of China.\" The B. are said\
        \ to possess several historical works, con taining an account of the lives\
        \ and actions of the different families of their princes; but they are fabulous,\
        \ and abound with omens and prodigies. They have also translations of the\
        \ history of China and Siam, and of the kingdoms of Kathee, Ko-shampyee, Pegu,\
        \ Saymmay, and Layuzayu. In scientific pursuits, the B. are far behind the\
        \ Hindus. Then astronomy is very defective, and their geography still more\
        \ so. The Birman year commences on the 18th of April. The common year is lunar;\
        \ but they are likewise acquainted with the solar year of 3G5 days. The year\
        \ is divided into 12 months, alternately consisting of 30 days and 29 days;\
        \ and is consequently 11 days shorter than the solar year. In order to bring\
        \ it nearly to coin cide with the solar year, an intercalary month is added\
        \ every third year. This, however, does not make the coincidence com plete,\
        \ and consequently the principal festivals revolve round the whole months.\
        \ The skill of theh* surgeons extends only to the dressing of wounds, and\
        \ the setting of bones. In medicine, the Birmans have several books. In law,\
        \ the B. have numerous trea tises, particularly the Institutes of Menu, and\
        \ copious commenta ries upon them. The king who sat on the throne when the\
        \ Brit ish embassy under Symes was sent to this country, bad caused the Institutes\
        \ of Menu to be translated from the English of Sir W. Jones. The B. are fond\
        \ of poetry and music. They have epic as well as religious poems of liigh\
        \ celebrity; and they are fond of reciting, in heroic numbers, the exploits\
        \ of their kings and generals. It is said that the prowess of the great Alompra,\
        \ trie deliverer of his country, is celebrated in verses not unworthy of his\
        \ courage and his fortune. The members of the British embassy s<r.v one of\
        \ their dramatic representations at Pegu, and gave it considerable praise.\
        \ The dialogue was spirited, without rant; the action animated, without being\
        \ extravagant; and the dresses of the principal performers were showy, yet\

        \ throughout the B. empire, and is cultivated more gen erally than in India,\
        \ which will be man, or beast, or nadt,\u2014a being superior to man \u2014\
        \ according to the merits or demerits of its predecessor. At last, after a\
        \ successive series of dissolutions and regenerations, all beings attain the\
        \ state oiniban or nertoan,\u2014 a state of ecstasy, or of per fect abstraction\
        \ from all sensation, thought, or desire. \u2014 The tem ples are usually\
        \ in the form of a pyramid, and some of them are of great height. Besides\
        \ images of Godama, the temples contain the images of the favourites of their\
        \ god, with representations of ani mals, such as elephants, monkeys, and lions.\
        \ The votaries of Godama say prayers at sunrise, and before they retire to\
        \ rest; and they make use of rosaries formed of various kinds of seeds. The\
        \ public acts of religion are reserved for particular solemnities, such as\
        \ the dedication of a temple, or the celebration of an annual festival. Offerings\
        \ are made; but the religion of Buddha forbids to sacrifice any animal. The\
        \ offerings consist of fruits, boiled rice, and flowers, with various figures\
        \ of paper and gold-leaf. The rich present white umbrellas, with ornaments\
        \ of gold, slip pers, canes, pillows, and gilded utensils; the poor, who cannot\
        \ afford offerings so expensive, present imitations of them in paper To gild\
        \ part of a temple is considered a very meritorious act. For three months\
        \ of the year, a kind of lent is observed, during which the more scrupulous\
        \ fast from sunrise to sunset. At the conclusion of this period, a whole month\
        \ is celebrated as a kind of festival. The rahans, or the priests of Godama,\
        \ do not appear to take any part in the religious acts performed in the temples;\
        \ few of them, indeed, are present at processions, or at religious ceremo\
        \ nies of any kind. They live together in colleges, or convents, founded for\
        \ that purpose by the munificence of the rich. The decency of their lives,\
        \ and their hospitality to strangers, are said to be eminent; and the respect\
        \ paid to them by the other classes of the community is considerable. No rahan\
        \ ever kindles a fire, lest by that act he deprive an animal of life; he consequently\
        \ dresses no victuals, but depends upon receiving them in that state from\
        \ the charity of others. He is allowed, however, to eat every kind of food\
        \ which may be presented ; even animal food is not forbidden to him. Every\
        \ rahan is, by his religious profession, bound to procure his food by ';the\
        \ labour of bis feet,\" as they term it. In the morning, as soon as he can\
        \ distinguish the veins on his hands, he issues from his convent, with his\
        \ sabeit, or ves sel of wicker-work, under his arm. Stopping at every door\
        \ in his way, but observing the deepest silence, he receives into his sabiet\
        \ such ready-dressed provisions as the inhabitants think proper to afford,\
        \ and passes on without returning thanks. He is forbidden to use solicitations;\
        \ and is not permitted even to give notice of his being at the door. The provisions\
        \ thus obtained, after satisfying the immediate necessities of the collector,\
        \ are given to the poor, or to the needy stranger. In every convent of rahans\
        \ there is a superior called zara, or 'reader,' who is sup posed to enjoy\
        \ considerable power among those of his own con vent, as they always approach\
        \ him with respect. The zaras of the principal convents live in splendid apartments,\
        \ have numer ous attendants, and enjoy several privileges denied to the princi\
        \ pal nobles. Their authority, however, does not extend beyond their own colleges.\
        \ Before a person be admitted into the priest hood, and received into a convent\
        \ of rahans, lie undergoes a pub lic examination, to discover whether or not\
        \ he be free of bodily infirmities. The initiation is pompous, and expensive\
        \ ; but a per son who has attached himself to this profession, is not supposed\
        \ to be bound to it for life: he may, when he pleases, without scan dal, quit\
        \ his convent, and engage in the active concerns of life. The kiounis, or\
        \ convents of the rahans, are different in their struc ture from common houses,\
        \ and resemble the architecture ofthe Chinese. Convents of young women are\
        \ said formerly to have existed, into which virgins entered, making a vow\
        \ of perpetual celibacy. T/te White elephant] Besides these wholly religious\
        \ characters, there is a very important personage, the second dignitary in\
        \ the kingdom, \u2014 the White elephant, who has a regular cabinet, com posed\
        \ of ministers, secretaries, under-secretaries, &c, &c. This animal is not,\
        \ as has been supposed, an object of worship among the B\u201E but merely\
        \ forms an indispensable part of the regalia of sovereignty. The title of\
        \ ' Lord of the White elephant,' or right ful possessor of an incarnate symbol\
        \ of Buddha, confers actual supremacy in the Buddhic states. The residence\
        \ of the White elephant is contiguous to the royal palace, with which it is\
        \ con nected by a long open gallery, supported by numerous wooden pillars,\
        \ at the farther end of whieh a curtain of black velvet em bossed with gold,\
        \ conceals the august animal from the eyes of the vulgar; and before this\
        \ curtain, the offerings intended for him are displayed. His trappings are\
        \ of gold, studded with large dia monds, pearls, sapphires, rubies, and other\
        \ precious stones; and his betel-box, ankle-rings, and the vessel out of wliich\
        \ he feeds, are all of pure gold. The elephant, thus treated, appears to be\
        \ an animal whose colour has been changed by a disease of the leprous kind;\
        \ but is by the Birmans supposed to contain a human soul, in the last stage\
        \ of many millions of transmigrations, and about to be absorbed into the essence\
        \ ofthe Deity. Language and Writing,] The language of the B. has 33 simple\
        \ sounds or characters ; and is, like the languages of Europe, written from\
        \ left to right. Its structure is very inartificial; and there are no inflexions;\
        \ the relations of Humber, mode, aud time, being in dicated by prefixing or\
        \ affixing certain particles. The Pali lan guage, written in the Sanscrit\
        \ alphabet, is tbe sacred text of Ava, Pegu, and Siam; but in a specimen of\
        \ the Lord's prayer in that dialect, the missionaries could only discover\
        \ three Sanscrit words. A part seems taken from the Chinese. The character\
        \ in common U6u is a round Nagari, derived from the Pali, which is square.\

        \ to have made any considerable progress. Their architecture is greatly interior\
        \ to that ofthe Hindus and the Chinese: the few respect able pagodas which\
        \ are found in the country are con structed after Siamese models. Their paintings\
        \ are unintelligible unless accompanied by written descrip tions. Crawfurd\

        \ a box for each letter of the Russian alphabet. This, though a very mechanical\

        \ was founded only in the year 1755. Among its professors may be reckoned\
        \ many names of great eminence. Fischer, the natu ralist, and others still\

        \ vast hall erected near the Kremlin, and more than twice the size of Westminster-hall.\
        \ It is intended for the parade of troops, when the weather does not admit\
        \ of their exercising out of doors; and has a length of 560 ft., with a width\
        \ of 168 ft. The walls are partly of stone, but more of brick; and the roof,\
        \ 506 ft. 10 in. long, and 133 ft. broad, is not supported by pillars. \u2014\
        \ Among other public buildings, M. contains a gen eral post-office for the\
        \ interior of Russia; also several military hospitals. No public institution\
        \ in M. is more remarkable than the foundling-hospital, erected by Catherine\
        \ II. in 1764, and amply supported by legacies and voluntary contributions.\
        \ The building is of a square form, and stands on the banks of the Moskva,\
        \ where it has the advantage of good air. It is fitted for the reception of\
        \ 8,000 children. The children who have been received into this hospital,\
        \ as they advance in years, are distributed into three classes. For the two\
        \ first years they are under the care of the nurses. They are then admitted\
        \ into the lowest or first class. The boys and girls are educated indiscriminately,\
        \ till they are seven years of age; and both sexes are taught not only reading,\
        \ writing, and arithmetic, but the knitting of stockings, and the carding\
        \ of flax, hemp, and wool. To these the girls add needle-work, spinning, cooking,\
        \ bak ing, and such arts as are necessary to housewifery. Those who evince\
        \ more than ordinary capacity, are instructed in the French and German languages;\
        \ and some of the boys are taught music, dancing, drawing, and Latin. Fourteen\
        \ is the age at which they are admitted into the last class. They have at\
        \ this period the liberty of choosing the profession in which they are to\
        \ be instructed. And for this pur pose it is not necessary that they should\
        \ quit the hospital, as several manufactures are established within it for\
        \ the sole purpose of training the youth to particular professions. At the\
        \ age of twenty they receive a sum of money, and are at liberty to settle\
        \ in any part of the empire which they think proper. The number of children\

        \ university of O. was founded has been the topic of frequent, manifold, and\
        \ in some respect unmeaning dispute. The earliest places of education in O.,\
        \ whoever established them, appear to have been cloistral schools; and, in\
        \ one form or other, were prohably coeval with the establishment of monasteries.\
        \ Secular schools, such as were held in private houses, seem to have speedily\
        \ followed; and when several of these became clustered in one house, they\
        \ were called a hall or hostel, and placed under a governor or principal.\
        \ As O. possessed monasteries in the time of Alfred, and was fre quently the\
        \ scene of his residence, that prince may be supposed to have encouraged any\
        \ clatistral school which existed in the place, or even to have founded one\
        \ or more new seminaries. Robert D'Oyley, who obtained the government of the\
        \ city under the Conqueror, founded in O. castle a college of secular canons,\
        \ which was placed under the control of a warden, and rapidly rose into celebrity.\
        \ Henry I. was educated at O.; and, during his reign, granted its teachers\
        \ and scholars some important privileges. Vacarius, a native of Lombardy,\
        \ established in the city a school of Roman law in the reign of Stephen. Richard\
        \ L, who was born at O , erected in it several new schools at his private\
        \ expense, and gave general encouragement to its literary institutions. In\
        \ the reign of Stephen, and again in that of Henry III , the stu dents are\
        \ asserted to have amounted to 30.000; and even at the founding of Merton\
        \ college, in 1274, they are said to have amounted to 15,000 But these figures\

        \ In the latter part of Henry Ill's reign, a taste arose for building colleges,\
        \ a charter of incorporation was granted to the university, and the aggregate\
        \ educational institutions of the city proximately assumed their present form.\
        \ In the reign of Edward II., new privileges were granted, lectures on the\
        \ Hebrew language were instituted, and a vexatious and agitating claim of\
        \ the preaching friars to confer degrees on their own authority was torn from\
        \ them by the university. In the reign of Richard II. occurred the great and\
        \ glorious sensation under the divinity lectures of Wycliffe, the warden of\
        \ Canterbury college. Though seven endowed colleges were founded before the\
        \ close of the 14th century, and most of the large number of hostels or halls\
        \ continued still to exist, many of these buildings at the expiry of that\
        \ century were either thinly attended by students or tempo rarily alienated\
        \ to uses different from those of their original destination. On Erasmus repairing\
        \ hither, in the reign of Henry VIL, and commencing tuition in the Greek language,\
        \ a strong party opposed him. In the early part of Henry VIII.'s reign, the\
        \ university receiver! rich accessions to its institutional appliances from\
        \ Cardinal Wolsey; and it afterwards won the king's special favour by giving\
        \ an opinion favourable to his di vorcing Queen Catharine Under Elizabeth,\
        \ it sustained agita tion, and perhaps permanent injury, from the rigid enforcement\
        \ of subscription to the articles of the nascent Established church. and the\
        \ consequent exclusion of a large proportion of its members who were favourable\
        \ to the doctrines of the Puritans, In tbe reign of James I., the university\
        \ acquired the right of sending 2 members to parliament. During the period\
        \ of Charles L. it ob tained some important additions to its privileges; and\
        \ afterwards, when the king had only a partial allegiance, and an insecure\
        \ throne, it displayed the most thorough loyalty to his person, and made great\
        \ hut unavailing sacrifices in his cause. Many profes sors and heads of colleges\
        \ were in consequence expelled hy the commissioners subsequently appointed,\
        \ to \"reform the discipline and correct the doctrines\" ofthe university;\
        \ and yielded place to Presbyterian and Independent successors. The Puritans,\
        \ how ever, had but brief possession, and were all turned adrift at the Restoration.\
        \ No public event of much interest has occurred in the university's history\
        \ since the Revolution. The university has always been governed by statutes\
        \ of its own making. These were in 1629 digested into a code, under the appellation\
        \ of Corpus Statutorum Universitatis Oxoniensis, and, in this form, except\
        \ on points where modern exigencies have com- pelled amendment or abrogation,\
        \ they continue to be in force. The style or title of the corporation is '\
        \ The Chancellor, Masters, ana Scholars, ofthe University of Oxford.' The\
        \ chancellor, the high est officer, holds his office for life, is usually\
        \ a nobleman of dis tinction who is elected by the members of convocation,\
        \ and at tends only on extraordinary occasions. The vice-chancellor, the highest\
        \ resident officer, is annually nominated by the chancellor from the heads\
        \ of colleges, but of late has generally held office by reappointment for\
        \ four years; he convenes all courts and meetings, enforces the laws, punishes\
        \ delinquents, licenses taverna in the city, and is a magistrate for Oxford,\
        \ Oxfordshire, and Berkshire; and he appoints 4 deputies from the heads of\
        \ colleges. The seneschallus or high-steward, is appointed by the chancellor,\
        \ and approved by convocation; he is always a nobleman, and holds his office\
        \ for life; he assists the chancellor, vice-chancellor, and proctors in the\
        \ execution of their respective duties. The proctors are two masters of arts,\
        \ of at least four years' standing chosen out ofthe several colleges by turns;\
        \ they are the imme diate guardians of the laws of the university, and in\
        \ all respects the acting magistrates; and, after being chosen, they nominate\
        \ 4 masters of arts to be pro-proctors, or to act as their deputies. Tlie\
        \ public orator is chosen by the convocation; he writes public letters and\
        \ addresses, and presents honorary degrees to those on whom they have been\
        \ conferred. The keeper of the archives, the assessor, the university council,\
        \ the registrar of the univer sity, librarians, clerks of the market and delegates\
        \ of the press, of accounts, of appeals, of estates, and of privileges, are\
        \ officers sufficiently described by their respective names. The whole cor\
        \ porate business ofthe university is transacted in two distinct as semblies,\
        \ called the House- of- Congregation, and the House-of- Convocation. The chancellor\
        \ or vice-chancellor, or one of the latter's four deputies, and the two proctors\
        \ or their respective de puties, preside in both houses, and on all occasions\
        \ indispensably require to be present The Ho use-of -Congregation consists\
        \ of doctors of every faculty resident in the university, heads of col leges\
        \ and halls, professors, public lecturers, masters of schools, public examiners,\
        \ the deans and censors of colleges, and masters of arts above one year's\
        \ standing, \u2014 all of whom are called re gents; and it occupies itself\
        \ almost exclusively with the passing of graces and dispensations, and the\
        \ granting of degrees. The House-of-Convocation consists of all the same members\
        \ as the former, and of masters of arts in their first year, and persons who\
        \ have been regents, and retain their names on the books, but have retired\
        \ from tlie university ; and it transacts all important busi ness, and exercises\
        \ power on all matters connected with the uni versity's affairs or interests,\
        \ \u2014 subject however, to some marked restrictions in the department of\
        \ legislation. A weekly court of record is held by the vice-chancellor, for\
        \ the recovery of debts within the limits of the university ; and a weekly\
        \ meeting, com posed of the vice-chancellor, the proctors, and the heads of\
        \ houses, is held for deliberation on all matters affecting the university's\
        \ liberties and privileges. The two representatives of the univer sity in\
        \ parliament are chosen by the vice-chancellor, the doctors, and the re_rent\
        \ and non-regent masters, in convocation. The regius professorships of divinity,\
        \ civil law, medicine, He brew, and Greek, were founded by Henry VIIL The\
        \ professor ship of divinity has since had annexed to it the canonry of Christ\
        \ church, and the rectory of Ewelme; that of law, a lay-prebend in the Cathedral\
        \ of Salisbury; that of medicine, tlie mastership of the hospital at Ewelme;\
        \ and that of Hebrew, a canonry of Christ-church. A regius professorship of\
        \ modern history aud modern languages, was founded by George I. in 1724. A\
        \ regius professorship of botany was founded by George III. in 1793; and a\
        \ previous professorship in the same department was founded, in 1728, by Dr.\
        \ Sherard. and endowed with \xA33,000. The Margaret professorship of divinity\
        \ was founded by the Countess of Rich mond; and has since had annexed to it\
        \ a prebend in Worcester cathedral. It is usually held by biennal re-election\
        \ for life The professorship of Natural philosophy was founded, in 1618. The\
        \ Savilian professorships of Geometry and Astronomy were founded in 1619.\
        \ The Camden professorship of ancient history was (bunded in 1622, and endowed\
        \ with the manor of Bexley in Kent A pre lectorship of anatomy was founded\
        \ in 1623, and appointed to be held by the regius professor of medicine. The\
        \ professorship of music was founded in 1626, but is held on one appointment\
        \ dur ing only a year. The Laudian professorship of Arabic was founded in\
        \ 1636. The professorship of Poetry is held for only five years, yet admits\
        \ of one reappointment The Anglo-Saxon pro fessorship was founded in 1~50,\
        \ is held for only five years, and admits only an Englishman and a bachelor.\
        \ The Vinerian pro fessorship of common law was founded in 1755. The Clinical\
        \ professorship, for reading clinical lectures in the Radcliffe infir mary\
        \ to the students in medicine, was founded in 1772. The Al drichian professorships\
        \ of anatomy, the practice of medicine, and chemistry, were founded in 1803;\
        \ the second and third are in the gift ofthe Convocation, while the first\
        \ is annexed to the prelec torship of anatomy. The professorship of Political\
        \ economy was founded in 1825. In 1842, her Majesty was pleased to found two\
        \ additional regius professorships in theology; the one in Pastoral Theology,\
        \ comprehending instruction in ministerial duties, com position and delivery\
        \ of sermons, knowledge and history of litur gies, rubrics, and the like ;\
        \ the other in Ecclesiastical History and tlie study of the Ancieut Fathers,\
        \ An anatomical lectureship, distinct from the prelectorship in tlie same\
        \ department, was founded abont 1750. A readership in Arabic is maintained\

        \ N. should not have increased the number of its in habitants in the same\

        yet to be served by what was set out, it must have been but a Lenten repast,

        butter for market. One of them had so waxy a complexion and so very subdued
        a look, that I could not help expressing a wish to put him on a course of
        beefsteaks, and my belief that such a regimen would soon give him a healthier
        and happier appearance. Brother Stephen was perhaps tickled by the notion,

        The troubles of the following period drew the old man once more into their
        vortex, and it was not till seven teen years after Caesar''s death, in the
        eighty-ninth year of his well-occupied life, that death called him away. The
        aesthetic writings, which have made him a name, were brief essays, some in
        simple prose and of graver contents, others humorous sketches the prose groundwork
        of which was inlaid with various poetical effusions. The former were the "
        phdosophico-historical dissertations " (Logistorici) , the latter the Menippean
        Satires. In neither case did he fodow Latin models, and the Satura of Varro
        in particidar was by no means based on that of Lucilius. In fact the Roman
        Satura in general was not properly a fixed species of art, but only indicated
        negatively the fact that the " multifarious poem " was not to be included
        under any of the recognised forms of art ; and accordingly the Sahira--poetvj
        assumed in the hands of every gifted poet a different and peculiar character.
        It was rather in the pre-Alexandrian Greek poetry that Varro found the models
        for his more severe as wed as for -his lighter aesthetic works ; for the graver
        dissertations, in the dialogues of Heraclides of Heraclea on the Black Sea
        (-f about 450), for the satires, in the writings of Menippus of Gadara in
        Syria (flourishing about 475). The choice was significant. Heraclides, stimulated
        as an author by Plato''s philosophic dialogues, had amidst the bridiance of
        their form totady lost sight of the scientific con tents and made the poetico-fabulistic
        dress the main matter; he was an agreeable and largely-read author, but far
        from a philosopher. Menippus was quite as little a philosopher, but the most
        genuine literary representative of that philo sophy whose wisdom consisted
        in denying philosophy and ridiculing philosophers, the cynical wisdom of Diogenes
        ; a comic teacher of serious wisdom, he proved by examples and merry sayings
        that except an upright life everything is vain in earth and heaven, and nothing
        more vain than the dis putes of so-caded sages. These were the true models
        for Varro, a man full of old Roman indignation at the pitiful times and fud
        of old Roman humour, by no means destitute withal of plastic talent, but as
        to everything which presented VOL. iv. s s', 1]

        \ age were gradually disappearing. The circumstance that the term urbanitas,\
        \ and the idea of a polished national culture which it expressed, arose during\
        \ this period, proves, not that it was in the ascendant, but that it was on\
        \ the wane, and that people were keenly alive to the absence of this urbanitas\
        \ in the lansruao-e and the habits of the Latinised barbarians or barbarised\
        \ Latins. Where we still meet with the urbane tone of conversation, as in\
        \ Varro's Satires and Cicero's Letters, it is an echo of the old fashion which\
        \ was not yet so obsolete in Reate and Arpinum as in Rome. Thus the previous\
        \ culture of youth remained substantially unchanged, except that \u2014 not\
        \ so much from its own deterio- ration as from the general decline of the\
        \ nation \u2014 it was pro- ductive of less good and more evd than in the\
        \ preceding epoch. Caesar initiated a revolution also in this department.\
        \ While the Roman senate had first combated and then at the most had simply\
        \ tolerated culture, the government of the new Italo-Hellenic empire, whose\
        \ essential character in fact was liumanitas, could not but adopt measures\
        \ to stimulate it after the Hellenic fashion. If Caesar conferred the Roman\
        \ fran- chise on ad teachers of the liberal sciences and all the phy- sicians\
        \ of the capital, we may discover in this step a paving of the way in some\
        \ degree for those institutions in which subsequently the higher bilingual\
        \ culture of the youth of the empfre was provided for on the part of the state,\
        \ and which form the most significant expression of the new state of liumanitas\
        \ ; and if Caesar had further resolved on the esta blishment of a public Greek\
        \ and Latin library in the capital and had already nominated the most learned\
        \ Roman of the age, Marcus Varro, as principal librarian, this implied unmis\
        \ takeably the design of opening up the cosmopolitan monarchy to cosmopolitan\
        \ literature. The development of the language during this period turned on\
        \ the distinction between the classical Latin of cultivated society and the\
        \ vulgar language of common life. The former itself was a product of the distinctively\
        \ Italian culture; even in the Scipionic circle \" pure Latin \" had become\

    - ['THE SUBURBS OF CALCUTTA. 245 '' Some twenty years ago, Baboo Joy Kissen Mookerjee,
        hav ing got an English school and dispensary endowed in the town of Ooterparrah,
        perceived tlie growing want of a library, with a reading-room attached to
        it, for the benefit of his countrymen. In order to supply this desideratum,
        the Baboo applied to Government, through the Commissioner of Revenue, Burdwan
        Division, to establish one on similar terms with those of the English school
        and the dispensary ; but not succeeding in his attempts, he undertook the
        work without any extraneous aid from the State. With this view, he caused
        a suitable building to be constructed upon the river-bank, at a cost of 85,000
        rupees ; and when the same was completed, he commenced the inaugu ration of
        the library, by7 collecting books and pamphlets from different places. At
        the time when this public library began, the books of the old Hurkaru Library
        were advertised for sale, and the Baboo availed himself of the opportunity
        to buy some of the oldest works from the same for his own library. These,
        added with those bought from the Calcutta China Bazaar book sellers, amounted
        to 5,000 volumes only. The Baboo, not being satisfied with such a meagre collection,
        resolved to extend the institution by purchase of additional books from hawkers,
        whom he invited over from Calcutta, to supply him with rare and valuable books
        and magazines, &c. at fair prices. Thus, when the books were purchased in
        the manner narrated above, to the number of 12,000 volumes, he set about working
        the library in the y7ear 1859, by appointing a librarian, an assistant librarian,
        one duffturee, one forash or sweeper, one durwar, and two mallees or gardeners.
        These formed the constitution ofthe library establishment, for the management
        of its duties in the beginning of the institution, and the same is continuing
        un altered up to the present day. To ensure proper supervision over the library,
        and to secure its permanency, the Baboo has appointed a body of native gentlemen
        as curators of his library, to whom he has made over a landed estate, yielding
        1 ,800 rupees a year ; but as more works in English and Sanscrit are yet to
        be added, he has made a separate provision for the purchase of the same. It

        \ the great City of Baltimore in the legislature of the State, almost a perfect\
        \ stranger, and no stake or interest in society. In my idle walks I had made\
        \ many personal acquaintances ; and there was my recent History of the War,\
        \ with a variety of other publications. But still more important was the practice\
        \ of stump speaking among candidates, which had recently been in troduced,\
        \ and it so happened that I became almost immediately successful and popular\
        \ in that line. The place of display was the elevated area in front of the\
        \ court-house, and the open space in the Monumental Square, for the reception\
        \ of the hearers. I shall not speak of my own oratory, except to say that\
        \ it was suc cessful beyond my expectations, and you may say its merits. I\
        \ was astonished at my own popularity. Among six candidates I carried the\
        \ election by fifteen hundred of a majority. I lost no popularity in the legislature,\
        \ but before the second election, the Missouri question arose, and as I took\
        \ the side of Missouri against restriction, my Quaker friends left me, and\
        \ in conse quence my majority fell off to one thousand. I now come to the\
        \ most important period of my life. Shortly after the rise of the legislature\
        \ (my second term), I received a letter from the Secretary of State, requesting\
        \ my presence at Washington, as the government had in contemplation an im\
        \ portant diplomatic mission in which, if it should take effect, Mr. Monroe,\
        \ then President, wished to engage my services. It was this which brought\
        \ me to Washington, where I have now been three months, waiting the maturity\
        \ of events, in the proposed mission to South America, in which I am to act\
        \ as secretary, with three commissioners, only one of whom has yet been se\
        \ lected \u2014 to wit, Mr. John Graham of the Department of State. My hunger\
        \ for books was here indulged in the library of Con gress, with the recent\
        \ addition of the library of Mr. Jefferson, purchased by the government, \u2014\
        \ the librarian and myself being about the sole occupants for several months.\
        \ This was indeed a feast for me. The library of Mr. Jefferson was particularly\
        \ rich in the works of contemporary periods of the American and French revolutions\

        \ at all attain. Transference from the Alexandrian academy to such an office\
        \ in the capital was demonstrably promotion.1 Even apart from all which the\
        \ Greek literati otherwise found in Rome alone, the court-positions and the\
        \ court-offices were enough to draw the most distinguished of them thither\
        \ rather than to the Egyptian \" free table.\" The learned Alexandria of this\
        \ time became a sort of \"jointure\" of Greek science, worthy of respect and\
        \ useful, but of no pervading influence on the great movement of culture or\
        \ mis-culture of the imperial period ; the places in the Museum were, as was\
        \ reasonable, not seldom bestowed on scholars of note from abroad, and for\
        \ the institution itself the books of the library were of more account than\
        \ the burgesses of the great commercial and manufacturing city. The military\
        \ circumstances of Egypt laid down, just as in Syria, a double task for the\
        \ troops there ; the pro tection of the south frontier and of the east coast,\
        \ which indeed may not be remotely compared with that required for the line\
        \ of the Euphrates, and the maintenance of internal order in the country as\
        \ in the capital. The Roman garrison consisted, apart from the ships stationed\
        \ at Alexandria and on the Nile, which seem chiefly to have served for the\
        \ control of the customs, under Augustus of three legions, along with the\
        \ not numerous auxiliary troops belonging to them, about 20,000 men. This\
        \ was about half as many as he destined for all the Asiatic provinces \u2014\
        \ which was in keeping with the importance of this province for the new monarchy.\
        \ But the occupy- 1 Examples are Chaeremon, the teacher of Nero, previously\
        \ installed in Alexandria (Suidas, Aeovbo-ios 'AXef avdpevs; comp. Zeller,\
        \ Hermes, xi. 430, and above, p. 259) ; Dionysius, son of Glaucus, at first\
        \ in Alexandria, successor of Chaeremon, then from Nero down to Trajan librarian\
        \ in Rome and imperial cabinet secretary (Suidas, i.e.); L. Julius Vestinus\
        \ under Hadrian, who, even after the presidency of the Museum, filled the\
        \ same positions as Dionysius in Rome (p. 248 note), known also as a philo\
        \ logical author. IS VOL. II.", 1]
    - ["SYRIA AND THE 130 BOOK VIII. Intellectual interests. But amidst all this luxury\
        \ the Muses did not find them selves at home ; science in earnest and not\
        \ less earnest art were never truly cultivated in Syria and more especially\
        \ in Antioch. However complete was the analogy in other respects between Egypt\
        \ and Syria as to their development, their contrast in a literary point of\
        \ view was sharp ; the Lagids alone entered on this portion of the inheritance\
        \ of Alexander the Great. While they fostered Hellenic literature and promoted\
        \ scientific research in an Aristo telian sense and spirit, the better Seleucids\
        \ doubtless by their political position opened up the East to the Greeks \u2014\
        \ the mission of Megasthenes to king Chandragupta in India on the part of\
        \ Seleucus I., and the exploring of the Caspian Sea by his contemporary the\
        \ admiral Patrocles, were epoch-making in this respect \u2014 but of immediate\
        \ interposition in literary interests on the part of the Seleucids the history\
        \ of Greek literature has nothing more to tell than that Antiochus the Great,\
        \ as he was called, made the poet Euphorion his librarian. Perhaps the history\
        \ of Latin literature may make a claim to serious scientific work on the part\
        \ of Berytus, the Latin island in the sea of Oriental Hellenism. It is perhaps\
        \ no accident that the reaction against the modernising tendency in literature\
        \ of the Julio-Claudian epoch, and the reintroduc tion of the language and\
        \ writings of the republican time into the school as into literature, originated\
        \ with a Bery tian belonging to the middle class, Marcus Valerius Probus,\
        \ who in the schools that were left in his remote home moulded himself still\
        \ on the old classics, and then, in energetic activity more as a critical\
        \ author than as strictly a teacher, laid the foundation for the classicism\
        \ of the later imperial period. The same Berytus became later, and remained\
        \ through the whole period of the empire, for all the East, the seat of the\
        \ study of jurisprudence re quisite towards an official career. As to Hellenic\
        \ litera ture no doubt the poetry of the epigram and the wit of the feuilleton\
        \ were at home in Syria ; several of the most noted Greek minor poets, like\
        \ Meleager, Philodemus of Gadara, and Antipater of Sidon, were Syrians and\
        \ unsur-", 1]
    - ["EG YPT. BOOK VIII. 272 had in the better epoch of Hellenism for the whole\
        \ Hellenic and Hellenising world, was never even remotely attached to the\
        \ Romano -Alexandrian. The cause lay not in the want of talents or in other\
        \ accidents, least of all in the fact that places in the Museum were bestowed\
        \ by the emperor sometimes according to gifts and always according to favour,\
        \ and the government dealt with them quite as with the horse of the knight\
        \ and the posts of officials of the household ; the case was not otherwise\
        \ at the older courts. Court -philosophers and court -poets remained in Alexandria,\
        \ but not the court ; it was here very clearly apparent that the main matter\
        \ was not pensions and rewards, but the contact \u2014 quickening for both\
        \ sides \u2014 of great political and great scientific work. The latter doubtless\
        \ presented itself for the new monarchy and brought its consequences with\
        \ it ; but the place for it was not Alexandria : this bloom of political develop\
        \ ment justly belonged to the Latins and to the Latin capital. The Augustan\
        \ poetry and Augustan science attained, under similar circumstances, to a\
        \ similar im portant and pleasing development with that attained by the Hellenistic\
        \ at the court of the Pergamenes and the earlier Ptolemies. Even in the Greek\
        \ circle, so far as the Roman government operated upon it in the sense of\
        \ the Lagids, this development was linked more with Rome than with Alexandria.\
        \ It is true that the Greek libraries of the capital were not equal to the\
        \ Alexandrian, and there was no institute in Rome comparable to the Alexandrian\
        \ Museum. But a position at the Roman libraries opened up relations to the\
        \ court. The professorship of Greek rhetoric in the capital, instituted by\
        \ Vespasian, filled up and paid for by the government, gave to its holder,\
        \ although he was not an officer of the household in the same sense as the\
        \ imperial librarian, a similar position, and was regarded, doubtless on that\
        \ account, as the chief professorial chair of the empire.1 But, above all,\
        \ the office of imperial cabinet secretary in its Greek division was the most\
        \ esteemed and the most influential position 1 '0 ivui Bpbvos in Philostratus,\

        \ very valuable editions of grammars, lexicons, Greek and Latin classics,\
        \ the Scriptures, the Fathers of the Church, ecclesiastical history and biography,\
        \ and various other subjects which have been deemed worthy of a place among\

        \ Clarendon Press,\" in the imprint, whereas from 1829 up to 1863 the imprint\
        \ was e Typographeo Academico, or\"at the University Press.\" The old Clarendon\
        \ buUding now contains offices for the use of the registrar of the University\
        \ ; the \" delegates\" room, in which the meetings of the Hebdomadal CouncU\
        \ and of delegacies take place ; the vice-chanceUor's justice room ; pubUc\

        \ the readers in mineralogy and geology ; and in the basement some rooms appro\
        \ priated to the poUce, and an office for the inspector of Aveights and measures.\
        \ Besides these apartments there are some others in the western portion of\
        \ the building, which are used as showrooms for a geological and minc ralogical\
        \ museum, which was presented to the Ashmo lean museum in 1S00 and 1832. The\
        \ latter-named buUding, however, being found too small to receive it, it was\
        \ transferred to its present site, where it may be seen every Monday, AA'ednesday,\
        \ and Friday, from 10 till 4 o'clock. The Ashmolean Museum stands to the AV.\
        \ of the Clarendon, being separated from it by the theatre. It OAves its origin\
        \ to Elias Ashmole, who presented to tho university his own medals, coins,\
        \ books, and MSS., together with a collection of natural curiosities bequeathed\
        \ to him by John Tradescant and his son in 1662. For the reception of these\
        \ the present buUding Avas erected, at the expense of the University, in 16S3,\
        \ under the superintendence of Sir C. AVren. It contains, amongst other things,\
        \ the library of AA'illiam Lily, the celebrated astrologer, the MSS. of Sir\
        \ W. Dugdale, Antony-a-AVood, and others, besides a collection of coins, medals,\
        \ antiquities, minerals, sheUs, specimens of natural history, casts, models,\
        \ and original portraits and pictures. In the building there are also some\
        \ rooms used as lecture-rooms by the professor of chemistry, and a laboratory\
        \ for the use of himself and his classes.\" The Badcliffe library, which lies\
        \ to the rear of the schools, is now used as a reading-room. It Avas completed\
        \ in 1747, in accordance with the Avill of its founder, John Bad cliffe, M.D.,\
        \ Fellow of Lincoln College, who left his property to trustees for charitable\
        \ purposes. He directed them, however, first to accumulate \xA340,000 for\
        \ the pur chase of this site and the erection of his library, and he left\
        \ \xA3100 per annum for the maintenance of the fabric, and \xA3150 per annum\
        \ as a stipend for the librarian. Since the opening of the University museum\
        \ the trustees have allowed the books upon natural science to be removed to\
        \ that institution, but the other volumes re main, and tho library is regarded\
        \ as a sort of branch of the Bodleian. The structure is circular in form,\
        \ and a spacious dome rising from its centre gives it quite a distinctive\
        \ feature among all the other public buUdings philosophy on the S. side, civil\
        \ law on the N., geometry, arithmetic, and metaphysics on the E., and so on.\
        \ AVith the exception, however, of those devoted to medicine and natural philosophy,\
        \ they are no longer appropriated to their original purposes, but have been\
        \ partly absorbed into the Bodleian Library, whUe another portion is used\
        \ as a gallery for the celebrated marbles presented to the University in 1677\
        \ by Henry Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, and known as the \" Arundel\
        \ Marbles ; \" while at the N.E. corner are the rooms which are now called\
        \ par excellence the \"schools,\" in which the public exami nations'of the\
        \ students are held for \"little-go,\" modera tions, and \" great-go.\" The\
        \ principal entrance to the schools is from Catherine-street, opposite to\
        \ Magdalen Hall, under a groined archway with carved oak folding-doors. The\
        \ arch is surmounted by a tower composed of the five orders of architecture,\
        \ and con taining four rooms or stories ; the first and second of these form\
        \ part of the Bodleian Library and picture gallery ; the third is the Archive\
        \ Room, in which are deposited the muniments, registers, and various other\
        \ public documents belonging to the University ; while the fourth, Avhich\
        \ was originally designed as an observatory, is now used as a class-room by\
        \ the reader in experi mental philosophy. On the AVestern side of the schools'\
        \ quadrangle is the divinity school. This building, Avhich was the basement\
        \ story of the first, or Duke Humphrey's library, was commenced in 1427, and\
        \ finished in 14S0. It is a fine specimen of Gothic architecture, with a vaulted\
        \ roof and pendants, and an exceedingly handsome entrance doorway. By the\
        \ time of Edward A'l. it had become so dilapidated that weeds and nettles\
        \ grew in it, and a pound was erected close by its side. In 1625, however,\
        \ it was repaired so far as to be avaUable for the sittings ol the House of\
        \ Commons \u2014 the House of Lords sitting in the picture-gallery, while\
        \ the Privy Council met at Christ Church, Avhen the court was driven from\
        \ London in consequence of the plague. During the Civil War it Avas used as\
        \ a granary, and at the end of the 17th century it was restored to its present\
        \ state, under the direction of Sir Christopher AVren, who opened the door\
        \ on the N. side, both to add to the effect and give greater facilities for\
        \ the entrance into the theatre. The school is now used for the recitation\
        \ of the exercises prescribed by the University for the degrees of B.D. and\
        \ D.D., and is bisected by a carved rail, the upper part being reserved for\
        \ the examiners and disputants, and the lower for the audience. At the AA'.\
        \ end of the divinity school is the Convocation House, which was buUt in 1639,\
        \ and forms the basement story to the Selden portion of the Bodleian. Its\
        \ name indicates its use, and the principal public business of the University\
        \ is carried on here. Here, also, degrees are conferred upon those who havo\
        \ \" got through the schools,\" or, in other Avords, passed their examinations,\
        \ and in the vestibule adjoin ing the vice-chancellor matriculates newly-admitted\
        \ students, and gentlemen are robed before going in to take their degrees,\
        \ and to give their votes at certain elections Avhich sometimes arc held in\
        \ the Convocation House. On these occasions the vice-chanceUor and the proctors\
        \ occupy seats at the upper end of the room, where also are seats for heads\
        \ of houses and doctors, and the side benches are reserved for masters of\
        \ arts and the general public. Upon the occasion of conferring degrees, when\
        \ a candidate's name is proposed the proctors Avalk once up and down the room,\
        \ one on each side. Should any one Avish to stop the degree, they do so by\
        \ pulling at a certain part of the proctor's gown as ho is passing, and from\
        \ this the word \" plucking\" has been applied to the refusal of a \" testamur,\"\
        \ or certificate of having passed, to those who have failed to satisfy the\
        \ examiners in the public schools. To the N. of the schools, at the corner\
        \ of Broad-street and Catherine-street, and directly opposite to the S. end\
        \ of Bark-street, are the Claren don BuUdings, which are so called from having\
        \ been founded out of the money raised by the sale of Lord Clarendon's \"\

        \ for the teaching and improving in the European languages.\" In 1760 Dr.\

        \ of Oxford, and for paintings, engravings, and other curiosities which may\
        \ occasionally be left to that learned body.\" The union of these bequests\
        \ and a grant from the funds of the University resulted in the erection of\
        \ the present buUding, at the corner of Beaumont and St. Giles's streets,\
        \ and close by the Martyrs' Memorial. It was commenced in 1841, and completed\
        \ in 1845, from the designs of Professor Cockerell, D.C.L, Its entire extent\
        \ is 240 feet by 102, and to give elevation to it the whole of it is raised\
        \ upon a terrace, by Avhich a light and spacious crypt, or basement, is obtained.\
        \ Al though the building is of the Palladian or Italian school in its disposition,\
        \ its order is Ionic, and its details and ornamentation aro taken from tho\
        \ temple of Apollo Epieurius, at Basso, near Phigalea, in Arcadia. The pediment\
        \ of the portico is surmounted by a figure of Apollo, and on the side of each\

        \ continental languages of Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, and having en\
        \ graved at their bases the names of the most celebrated literary characters\
        \ of the countries which they respec tively represent. The centre portico\

        \ thus deprived of their library, formed a new collection, of which but little\

        \ to the inner court was built, with a fireproof room over it, in which are\
        \ kept the MSS. The library has a large north-west bay-window of richly ornamented\
        \ stained and painted glass ; in the top division is a very large coat of\
        \ the arms of tbe see and Archbishop Juxon; and underneath are the arms of\
        \ the see and Archbishop Howley, 1829. Around are smaller coats of the arms\
        \ of about twenty-four archbishops, each impaled with the arms of the see.\
        \ Here are also the arms of Philip II. King of Spain; but tbe most curious\
        \ piece of painted glass is an ancient portrait of Archbishop Chicheley. The\

        \ eight main ribs, with longitudinal braces, springing from corbel brackets,\
        \ and enriched with carved spandrels, pendants, enwreathed mitres, and the\
        \ arms of Juxon and the see of Canterbury several times repeated. Above the\
        \ two fireplaces are painted the arms of the see, impaling those of Bancroft,\
        \ the founder of the library ; and of Seeker, a liberal contributor. The books,\
        \ over-estimated by Ducarel at 25,000 volumes, are kept in wall and projecting\
        \ oak cases ; the earliest printed works being in the south-west bay-window\
        \ recess. Until Bancroft bequeathed his books in 1610, each archbishop brought\
        \ his own private collection. Bancroft's books remained at Lambeth till 1646,\
        \ two years after the execution of Laud, when being seized by the Parliament,\
        \ the use of them was granted to Dr. Wincocke. They were subsequently given\
        \ to Sion College, and many began to get into private hands ; when Selden\
        \ suggested to the University of Cambridge a right to them, and they were\
        \ delivered, pursuant to an ordinance of Parliament, dated Feb. 1647, into\
        \ their possession. After the Restoration, and re peated demands by Juxon\
        \ and Sheldon, the books were collected, including those in private hands,\
        \ and in the possession of John Thurloe and Hugh Peters. Evelyn writes to\
        \ Pepys, in ] 6S9, that the library was then \" replenished with excellent\
        \ books, but that it ebbs and flows, like the Thames running by it, at every\
        \ prelate's accession or translation.\" The books left by Archbishops Bancroft,\
        \ Abbot, Laud, Sheldon, and Tenison, bear their arms. There is only one volume\
        \ in tbe collection known to have be longed to Archbishop Parker, which is\
        \ a volume of Calvin's writing : his arms are on the outside, and within is\
        \ written in red lead, \" J. Parker,\" who was the archbishop's son. The first\
        \ complete Catalogue made of the printed hooks was drawn up hy Bishop Gibson\
        \ when librarian. In 1718 it was fairly copied by Dr. Wilkins, in three volumes\
        \ folio; and it has been continued by his successors to the present time.\
        \ The library consists of rare and curious editions of the Scriptures, commentaries\
        \ of the early fathers, scarce controversial divinity, records of ecclesiastical\
        \ affairs, English history and topography ; many fine copies, splendidly embellished.\
        \ The early printed books (see the Rev. Dr. Maitland's two Catalogues) include,\

        \ the architect of the new chapel, as stated in the print by Vertue, in 1751\
        \ : it stands upon an open crypt or cloister, in which the students of the\

        \ about 1596, among the spoils acquired by the gallant Earl of Essex at the\
        \ capture of Cadiz. The ascent to the chapel is by a flight of steps, under\
        \ an archway and porch, the latter built by Hardwick in 1843. The windows\
        \ are filled with glass, unusually fine : those on the sides have figures\

        diamond-hilted sword; besides cuirasses, helmets, and other trophies, captured
        by tbe soldier-Marquis in the Peninsular War. Hope House (Mrs. Hope), south-east
        corner of Down-street, Piccadilly, was built in 1849, for the late H. T. Hope,
        Esq., under the joint superintendence of M. Dusillion, a French artist, and
        Professor Donaldson. The fronts are Caen stone, and have panels of decorative
        marbles in the piers between the windows ; the arrangement of which is novel,
        especially in the attic-story. The total height from the street-level to the
        balus trade (surmounted with superbly-carved vases) is 62 feet. The entrance-porch
        in Down-street is very rich ; in the principal window-pediments are sculptured
        the armo rial bearings of Mr. Hope, repeated with the initial H in the very
        handsome iron railing, cast by Andre in Paris. The details throughout show
        very careful and elegant draw ing ; and the carving, wholly by French artists,
        is beautifully executed. The grand staircase and hall occupy the centre of
        the building ; the upper hall is paved with coloured marbles in patterns.
        The walls are plaster-of- Paris polished, scagliola panels, and marble plinths
        ; the floors, fire-proof, are of cast-iron girders and tile arches. The ceilings
        are panelled and enriched ; the principal doors are of oak, carved with the
        initial H in shields ; some of the chimney-pieces are of pierre-de-tonnerre,
        panelled with French marbles ; others are of bronzed metal, with caryatid
        figures. The stables (for 12 horses) and coach-houses are in the rear of the
        mansion. W. Cubitt and Co., builders ; ornamental work (wainscot doors, ceilings,

        There are few pictures here, the col lections having been removed to Deepdene,
        in Surrey. Among tbe antiques is Sir William Hamilton''s second collection,
        made at Naples. The mansion may be seen by cards obtainable by introduction
        to the owner. The collection wos formed at the celebrated mansion in Duchess-street,
        Portland-place, in the deco ration of which Mr. Hope, the author of Anastasius,
        exemplified the classic principles illustrated hi his large work on Household
        Furniture and Internal Decorations, 1805. Thus the suite of apartments included
        tho Egyptian or Black Room, with ornaments frora scrolls of papyrus ond mummy-cases
        ; the furniture ond ornoments were pale yellow and bluish-green, relieved
        by mosses of block ond gold. The- Blue or Indian Room, iii costly Oriental
        style. The Star Room : emblems of Night below : and above, Aurora visiting
        Cephalus on Mount Ida, by Flaxman; furniture, wreathed figures of the Hours.

        : Ionic columns, entablature, and pediment from the Temple of Erectheus ot
        Athens; car of Apollo, classic tables, pedestals, &c. In four separate apartments
        were arranged 200 Greek vases, including two copies of the Barberini or Portland
        Vase ; the furniture partly from Pompeian models. The New Gallery, for 100
        pictures of the Flemish school, antique bronzes and vases ; furniture of elegant
        Grecian design. Mr. Hope died at Duchess-street in 1831 : he will ever be
        remembered for his taste and munificence as the early patron of Chantrey,
        Flax man, Canova, and Thorwaldsen. Lansdowne House (Marquis of Lansdowne),
        which, with its garden, occupies the south side of Berkeley-square, was commenced
        by Robert Adam for the Marquis of Bute, but was sold unfinished to Lord Shelburne,
        created Marquis of Lansdowne in 1784. The purchase-money was 22,000?., but
        the mansion cost Lord Bute 25,000Z. The Marquis, In 1804, acknowledged the
        possession of the secret of the authorship of Junius''s Letters, which he
        promised to publish ; but his lordship died in the following week. The " Letters"
        are believed by some to have been the joint production of Lord Shelburne,
        Colonel Barre1, and Dunning, Lord Ash burton ; and their three portraits,
        painted in one picture by Sir Joshua Reynolds, in 1784-5, have been regarded
        as evidence of the joint authorship. Possibly, therefore, Junius''s Letters
        were written in Lansdowne, then Shelburne, House. It is better estabUshed,
        thot oxygen was discovered here, Aug. 1, 1774, by Dr. Priestley, then librarian
        to Lord Shelburne. The reception-room contains a fine collection of sculpture,
        including about fifty statues, as many busts, besides bassi relievi : it was
        commenced by Gavin Hamilton, who first excavated the site of Adrian''s Villa.
        At the foot of the staircase is a noble statue of Diana launching an arrow
        ; in the great dining-room are nine antique statues in niches, including Germanicus,
        Claudius, Trajan, and Cicero; also the Sleeping Nymph, the last work of Canova
        ; in the front drawing-room his Venus quitting the Bath ; and a statue by
        Rauch, of Berlin, of a Child holding an alms-dish. In the gallery, 100 feet
        in length, at the east end are life-size statues of Hercules, Marcus Aurelius,
        Mercury, Diomede, Theseus, Juno, an Amazon, Juno standing, Hercules when a
        youth, Jason, &c. ; and here are two Egyptian black marble statues, found
        at Tivoli. On the sides of the gallery are the busts, reliefs, &c.', 1]

        \ for its gardens : Ely -place had its kitchen and flower gardens, vineyard\
        \ and orchard, and the bishops were celebrated for raising choice fruit. (See\
        \ Elx Place, p. 321.) Gerarde was aa apothecary, and, before the year 1597,\
        \ had a large physic-garden near his house in Holborn, where he raised 1000\
        \ plants and trees ; a proof \" that our ground could produce other fruits\
        \ besides hips and haws, acorns, and pignuts.\" Gerarde had another physic-garden,\
        \ in Old-street : his earliest publication was the Catalogue (in Latin) of\
        \ his own garden in Holborn, printed in 1596, 4to; reprinted in 4to, 1599.\
        \ The first edition was dedicated to Lord Burghley, whose garden Gerarde had\
        \ superintended for twenty years : the second edition was dedicated to Sir\
        \ Walter Raleigh. A copy of the first edition (of extreme rarity) is in the\
        \ British Museum ; and it proved of great use to Mr. Aiton in preparing his\
        \ Hortus Kewensis, by enabling him to ascertain the time when many old plants\
        \ were first cultivated. Gerarde dated the first edition of his Herbal from\
        \ Holborn. Wood calls him \" the best herbalist of his time.\" Among the Lansdowne\
        \ MSS. in the British Museum, is a letter of Gerarde's own drawing-up, for\
        \ Lord Burghley to re commend to the University of Cambridge the establishment\
        \ of a physic-garden there, to encourage the \" facultie of simpling.\" Several\
        \ London localities of Gerarde's sim pling may be gathered from his Herbal.\
        \ Thus, he says : \" Of water violets I have not found any such plenty in\
        \ any one place as in the water ditches adjoining to Saint George his ficlde,\
        \ near London.\" He describes Mile End, Whitechapel, as \" the common near\
        \ London where penny-royal grows in great abundance.\" \"The small wild huglosse\
        \ grows upon the drie ditch bank about Pickadilla ;\" and he found \" white\
        \ saxifrage, burr-reedes, &c.,\" in the ditch, right against the place of\
        \ execution, St. Thomas-a- Waterings, now the Old Kent-road. Baldwin's Gardens,\
        \ between Leather-lane and Gray's-innlane, were, according to a stone upon\
        \ a corner-house bearing the arms of Queen Elizabeth, named after Richard\
        \ Baldwin, one of the royal gardeners, who began building here in 1589. Montague\
        \ House, Bloomsbury, had its spacious gardens, \" after the French manner\
        \ ;\" and the gardens of the houses in Great Russell-street were noted for\
        \ their fragrance. Strype (1720) describes the north side as having gardens\
        \ behind the houses, with tbe prospect of pleasant fields up to Hampstead\
        \ and Highgate, \" inasmuch as this place is esteemed the most healthful in\
        \ London.\" The garden of the Earl of Lincoln was highly kept, long before\
        \ the mansion became an Inn of Court. The Earl's bailiff's accounts (24 Edward\
        \ I.) show it to have pro duced apples, pears, large nuts, and cherries sufficient\
        \ for the Earl's table, and to yield by sale in one year 135/., modern currency.\
        \ The vegetables grown were beans, onions, garlick, leeks ; hemp was grown\
        \ ; the cuttings of the vines much prized ; of pear-trees there were several\
        \ varieties; the only flowers named are roses. (T. Hudson Turner.) The \"\
        \ walk under the elms,\" celebrated by Ben Jonson, was a favourite resort\
        \ of Isaac Bickerstaff. In 1 and 2 Philip and Mary, the walk under the trees\

        \ Archbishop Howley rebuilt the habitable portion of the palace, and restored\
        \ other parts, at a cost of 60,000?. The garden-front is of Tudor character\
        \ j and with its bays and enriched windows, battle ments, gables, towers,\
        \ and clustered chimney-shafts, is very picturesque. The Gate-house, built\
        \ by Archbishop Morton about 1490, consists of an embattled centre and two\
        \ immense square towers, of fine red brick with stone dressings, and a spacious\
        \ Tudor arched gateway and postern. The towers are ascended by spiral stone\
        \ staircases, leading to the Record-room containing many of the archives of\
        \ the see of Canterbury. Adjoining the archway is a small prison-room, with\
        \ high and narrow windows, and thick stone walls to which are fastened three\
        \ strong iron rings ; and in the wall are cuttings, including (Sraftait, and\
        \ a cross and other figures near it. The walls and towers of the gate-house,\
        \ and the ancient brick wall on the Thames side, are chequered with crosses\
        \ in glazed bricks. At this gate the dole immemorially given to the poor by\
        \ the Archbishops of Canterbury is constantly distributed. It consists of\
        \ fifteen quartern loaves, nine stone of beef, and five shillings worth of\
        \ half pence, divided into three equal portions, and distributed every Sunday,\
        \ Tuesday, and Thursday, among thirty poor parishioners of Lambeth ; the beef\
        \ being made into broth and served in pitchers. The Lollards' Tower, on the\
        \ left of the outer court, is embattled, and chiefly of dark-red brick, faced\
        \ with stone on its outer sides. It was built (1434-5) by Arch bishop Chicheley,\
        \ whose arms are sculptured on the outer wall on the Thames side; beneath\
        \ them is a Gothic niche, wherein formerly stood the image of St. Thomas _\
        \ Becket. In this tower is the Post-room, with a flat and panelled ceiling,\
        \ carved with angels and scrolls, and a head resembling that of Henry VIII.\
        \ On the east side is an entrance to the Chapel ; and through a small door\
        \ you ascend by a steep spiral stair case to the Lollards' Prison (in an adjoining\
        \ square tower on the north side), entering by a narrow, low, pointed archway\
        \ of stone, with an oaken inner and outer door, each 3j inches thick, closely\
        \ studded with iron rivets and fastenings. This chamber is nearly 15 feet\
        \ in length, by 11 feet in width, and 8 feet high ; and has two narrow windows,\
        \ and a small fireplace and chimney. About breast-high are fixed in the walls\
        \ eight large iron rings ; and upon the oaken wainscoting are incisions of\

        \ of other prisons here, which the registers of the see prove the arch bishops\
        \ to have possessed. To Lambeth House the Popish prelates, Tunstall and Thirlby,\
        \ were committed by Queen Elizabeth : and here were confined the Earl of Essex\
        \ ; the Earls of Chesterfield and Derby ; Sir Thomas Armstrong, afterwards\
        \ executed for participation in the Duke of Monmouth's rebellion ; Dr. Allestry,\
        \ the eminent divine ; and Richard Lovelace, the poet. In the three stories\
        \ above the Post room are apartments for the archbishop's chaplains and librarian.\
        \ The Chapel, entered from the Post-room, is divided by an elaborately carved\
        \ screen; but the arched roof is concealed by flat panelling, bearing the\

        of tbe members, including Dr. (afterwards Bishop) Wilkins, removed to Oxford,
        and were joined by Seth Smith, Ralph Bathurst, Sir William Petty, and the
        Hon. Robert Boyle, who met at Petty''s lodgings in an apothecary''s house,
        " because of the convenience of inspecting drugs." The members in London continued
        also to meet, until, in 1658, they were ejected from Gresham College, which
        was required for barracks. Evelyn, Cowley, and Sir William Petty proposed
        separate plans for a " philosophical college :" Sprat says that Cowley''s
        proposition accelerated the foundation of the Royal Society, in praise of
        which he sub sequently wrote an ode. At the Restoration, in 1660, the meetings
        were revived ; and April 22, 1662, the Society was incorporated by royal charter,
        by Charles II. This charter is on four sheets of" vellum, and has on the first
        sheet ornamental initials and flowers, and a finely executed portrait of Charles
        in Indian ink; appended is the Great Seal in green wax. The Charter empowers
        the President to wear his hat while in the chair, and the fellows addressed
        the President bareheaded till he made a sign for them to put on their hats
        ; customs now obsolete. Next year the King granted a second charter, which
        is of greater importance than the first ; and his Majesty presented the Society
        with the silver-gilt mace. The Mace is about _ feet in length, and weighs
        190 oz. avoirdupois : its stem is chased with the thistle, and has an urn-shaped
        head, surmounted by a crown, ball, and cross. Upon the head are embossed figures
        of a rose, harp, thistle, and fleur-de-lis, and the initials CR. four times
        repeated. Under the crown are chased the royal arms ; aud at the other extremity
        of the stem are two shields, one bearing the Society''s arms, the otber a
        Latin inscription denoting the mace to have been presented to the Society
        by Charles II. in 1663. lt was long believed by numberless visitors to be
        the "bauble" mace turned out ofthe House of Commons by Cromwell when be dissolved
        the Long Parhament; but Mr. Weld, tbe assistant-secretary aud librarian, in
        a communication to the Society, April 30, 1846, proved tbis to be a popular
        error, by showing the warrant for making this mace and delivering it to Lord
        Brouncker, the first President of the Society. Again, the " bauble" was altogether
        different in form from the Society''s mace, and was nearly destitute of ornament,
        and without the crown and cross, as described in Whitelock''s Memorials, and
        represented accordingly in West''s picture of the Dissolu tion of tbe Loug
        Parliament. From this session, 1663, date the Philosophical Transactions,
        wherein the proceed ings and discoveries of the Society are registered. This
        year the Society exercised their privilege of claiming the bodies of criminals
        executed at Tyburn, which were to be dissected in Gresham College. In 1664,
        the king signed himself in the charter-book as the founder; and his brother,
        the Duke of York, signed as a fellow. In 1067 Chelsea College was granted
        to the Society, for their meetings, laboratory, repository, and library ;
        but the building was too dilapidated, " the annoyance of Prince Rupert''s
        glass-house" adjoined it, and the property was purchased back for tbe king''s
        use for 1300?. The Society then resumed their meetings in Gresham College,
        until they were dispersed by the Great Plague and Fire, after which they met
        in Arundel House in the Strand. The Fellows now (1667) numbered 200, and their
        subscription ls. per week; from the payment of which Newton, who joined the
        Society in 1674, was excused, on account of his narrow finances. In 1674 the
        Society returned to Gresham College. They were fiercely attacked : a Warwick
        physician accused them of attempting to undermine the Universities, to bring
        in popery and absurd novelties ; but a severer satire was The Elephant in
        the Moon, by Butler. Among their early practices was the fellows gathering
        May-dew, and ex perimenting with the divining-rod ; and the Hon. Robert Boyle
        believed in the efficacy of the touch of Greatrakes the Stroker for the evil.
        In 1686 Newton presented his Principia to the Society, whose clerk, Halley,
        the astronomer, printed the work. The MS., entirely in Newton''s hand, is
        preserved in the library. In 1703 Sir Isaac Newton was elected president.
        In 1710 the society purchased the house of Dr. Brown, at the top of Crane-court,
        Fleet-street, " being in the middle of the town and out of noise." This house
        was built by Wren, after the Great Fire of 1666, upon the site of the mansion
        of Dr. Nicholas Barbon. This new purchase was considered unfortunate for the
        society. The house required several hundred pounds'' repairs ; the rooms were
        small and inconvenient compared with those of Gresham Col lege ; and the removal
        led to the separation of the Society from the College Professors, after being
        associated for nearly fifty years. The house in Crane-court fronted a garden,
        where was a fishpond. There is a small hall on the ground floor, and a passage
        from tbe staircase into the garden, fronting which are the meeting-room, 25J

        \ the residence of astrologers. At Tradescant's house, in South Lambeth-road,\
        \ lived Elias Ashmole, who won Aubrey over to astrology (sea pp. 309 and 396).\
        \ Simon Forman's burial is entered in the Lambeth parish-register \u25A0 he\
        \ died on the day he had prognosticated. Lilly says, Forman wrote in a book\
        \ left behind him : \" This I made the devil write with his own hand in Lambeth\
        \ Fields, 1569, in June or July, as I now remember.\" Captain Bubb, contemporary\
        \ with Forman, dwelt in Lambeth Marsh, and \" resolved horary questions astrologically,\"\
        \ a ladder which raised him to the pillory. At the north corner of Calcot-alley\
        \ lived Francis Moore, astrologer, physician, and schoolmaster, and the original\
        \ author of \" Moore's Almanack.\" Next to Tradescant's house lived the learned\
        \ Dr. Ducarel, one of the earliest Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries,\
        \ and librarian at Lambeth Palace. Lambeth Marsh, by Hollar's map, extended\
        \ from near Stangate to Broadwall ; and was bounded by the river on the north-west,\
        \ and the ancient way or road called Lam beth Marsh on tho south-east. The\
        \ names of Narrow-wall and Broad-wall were derived from the embankments subsequently\
        \ made. In cutting for the railway and lines of sewerage at the great terminus\
        \ near York-road (a space in size equal to Grosvcnor-square), there was found\
        \ a large deposit from the inundations of the Thames, con taining gravel-stones\
        \ and dark wet clay, or pressed river-mud, imbedding fragments of twigs, bones,\
        \ pieces of Roman tile, &c. Narrow-wall, Vine-street, and Cornwall-road are\
        \ delineated in views of these suburbs in Queen Elizabeth's reign: Vine-street\
        \ is from eight to ten feet below the level of the adjacent streets. In tho\
        \ Marsh stood, until 1823, an old house, called Bonner's house, which was\
        \ traditionally known as the residence of Bishop Bonner. Near the Marsh resided\
        \ Thomas Bushell, a man of scientific attainments, who was a friend of Lord\
        \ Chancellor Bacon. He obtained from Charles 1. a grant to coin silver money\
        \ for the purposes of the king, w,hen the use of his Mint at the Tower was\
        \ denied to the king. When Oliver Cromwell assumed the protectorate, Thomas\
        \ Bushell hid himself in this house, wliich it seems had a turret upon it.\
        \ A large garret extended the length of the premises ; in this the philosopher\
        \ lay hid for upwards of a year. This apart ment he had hung with black ;\
        \ at one end was a skeleton extended on a mattress : at the other was a low\
        \ bed, on which he slept ; and on the dismal hangings of the wall were depicted\
        \ several emblems of mortality. At the Restoration, Charles II. supported\
        \ Bushell in some of his speculations. He died in 1674, eighty years of age,\
        \ and was buried in the little cloisters of Westminster Abbey. At South Lambeth,\
        \ upon the site of Sir Noel Caron's mansion and deer-park, are Beaufoy's Vinegar\
        \ and Wine Works. Here were a vessel of sweet wine containing 59,109 gallons,\
        \ and another of vinegar of 56,799 gallons; the lesser of which exceeded the\
        \ famous Heidelberg tun by 40 barrels. Mr. Beaufoy, F.R.S., was an eminent\
        \ mathematician, and a munificent patron of education; his bust is placed\
        \ in the Council Chamber, Guildhall. In Lambeth Walk, close upon the South-Western\
        \ Rail way, are the Lambeth Ragged Schools, founded in 1851 by Mr. Beaufoy,\
        \ at the expense of 10,000?., and 4000?. endowment, as a memorial of the benevolent\
        \ Mrs. Beaufoy, the wife of the founder. On part of the site of Belvedere\
        \ House and Gardens were established, in 1785, the Lambeth Water-works, first\
        \ taking their water from the borders of the Thames, then from its centre,\
        \ near Hungerford Bridge, by a cast-iron conduit-pipe 42 inches in diameter\
        \ ; whence, in 1852, the works were removed to Seething Wells, Ditton, 23\
        \ miles by the river-course from London Bridge. Thence the water is supplied\
        \ to the Company's reservoirs at Brixton, 10s miles, by steam pumping-engines,\
        \ at the rate of 10,000,000 gallons daily; from these reservoirs, 100 feet\
        \ above the Thames, the water flows by its own gravity through the mains ;\
        \ but at Norwood it is lifted by steam power 350 feet, or the height of St.\
        \ Paul's Cathedral, above the supplying river. _____", 1]

        \ PATMORE. Archbishop Trench, a scholar, poet, and divine, was born at Dublin\
        \ in September, 1807, and graduated at Cambridge in 1829, after which he spent\
        \ some years in travelling abroad. While holding the incumbency of Cardridge,\
        \ Hants, he published, in 1838, two volumes of poems. These, having been well\
        \ received by the public, were followed by \" Genoveva,\" \" Elegiac Poems,\"\
        \ which also elicited favourable notices. In 1841 he be came Curate to the\
        \ present Bishop of Oxford, at Alverstoke, and afterwards Rector of Itchinstoke.\
        \ He was also Hulsean Lecturer at Cambridge, and in 1847 he was appointed\
        \ to the important office of Theological Professor in King's College, London.\
        \ On the death of Dr. Buckland, which caused a vacancy in the Deanery of Westminster,\
        \ he was nominated to that office, since which he has been preferred to the\
        \ Archbishopric of Dublin. His sermons are considered eloquent and impressive.\
        \ Those preached at the special services for the working classes, delivered\
        \ at Westminster Abbey, have been attended by very crowded congregations.\
        \ He has published several works on theological subjects ; among these aro\
        \ \" Notes on the Parables,\" \" Notes on the Miracles,\" \" The Sermon on\
        \ the Mount,\" &c. ; and his lectures on the \" English Language\" and on\
        \ the \" Study of Words \" have had a largo circulation. Coventry Patmore,\
        \ an English poet, was born at Woodford, in Essex, 23rd July, 1823. His father\
        \ was in his day a well-known literary celebrity, and in 1846 Mr. Coventry\
        \ Patmore became an Assistant Librarian to the British Museum, which office\
        \ he continues to hold. He has published three volumes, of which the second,\
        \ the \" Angel in tho House,\" is a poem of undoubted merit ; but the third,\
        \ \"Faithful for ever,\" has been severely criticised. He is understood to\
        \ be a con tributor to the \" Edinburgh Review.\" ALEXANDER SMITH. Alexander\
        \ Smith, a poet, was born on 31st of December, 1830, at Kilmarnock, Ayrshire.\
        \ His early intention was to qualify himself for the ministry, but circumstances\
        \ of various kinds prevented him from entering on the preparatory studies.\
        \ While following tho business of a laoe-pattern designer in Glas gow, he\
        \ began to write verses, and sent some extracts from his first sustained poem\
        \ to the Rev. George Gilfillan, of Dundee, then under stood to be one of the\
        \ writers for the \"Critic,\" who inserted them in that journal. His \" Life\
        \ Drama \" was afterwards published, and, although severely criticised, was\
        \ admitted on all hands to contain lines of the highest poetical merit. In\
        \ 1854 Mr. Smith was elected to the secretaryship of the Edinburgh University.\
        \ His \"Life Drama\" and \"City Poems \" are his principal works. GERALD MASSE\
        \ Y. Gerald Massey, an English poet, was born May, 1828, near Tring, in Herts.\
        \ His parents wero so steeped in poverty that the children received scarcely\
        \ any education. When only eight years old, Gerald was sent to work in a neighbouring\
        \ silk mill ; but the mill being burned down, the boy took to straw plaiting.\
        \ Ho had learned to read at a penny school ; and, when fifteen, went up to\
        \ London as an errand boy, and spent all his spare time in reading and writing.\
        \ When out of a situa tion, he has gone without a meal to purchase a book.\
        \ His first appearance in print was in a provincial paper ; ho published a\
        \ small collection of his verses in his native town, and during tho political\
        \ excitement of 1848 edited a cheap paper called the \" Spirit of Freedom.\"\
        \ His -writing was so bold and vigorous, that his political manifestations\
        \ cost him five situations in eleven months. He was a warm advocate of the\
        \ co-operative system, THE VERY REV. HENRY ALFORD, D.D. The Very Rev. Henry\
        \ Alford, D.D., Dean of Canterbury, a poet and Biblical critic, was born in\
        \ London in 1810, and educated at Ilminster Grammar School, and Trinity College,\
        \ Cambridge. He has published several poetic productions, which have been\
        \ well received, has held several University appointments, and various preferments\
        \ in the Church. His editions of the Greek New Testament have been carefully\
        \ prepared. He is also the author of several papers, con tributed to serials\

        \ that the boys should live together in one house, or two houses, as mi^ht\
        \ be found most convenient, along with their governor, officers, and servants,\
        \ and he devised the sum of \xA3500 to purchase such house or houses. At the\
        \ same time he expressed his wish that the premises called \" The College\
        \ \" might be purchased, if they could be obtained on suitable terms, for\
        \ the purpose of this institution and he was himself in treaty for them soon\
        \ after the establishment of the Commonwealth ; but the contract was not made\
        \ till after the Restoration, when the dowager countess of Derby, Charlotte\
        \ Tremouille the celebrated heroine of Lathom House, conveyed them to the\
        \ feoffees, and they have ever since been used as the blue-coat hospital or\
        \ school and library. The founder by his will further expressed his wish that\
        \ his hospital might be incorporated and made a body politic, and King Charles\
        \ II. accordingly granted a charter of incorporation, by letters-patent, dated\
        \ 20th November 1665, in which the founder is styled \"our trusty and well-beloved\
        \ Humphrey Chetham,\" and designated as \" a person of eminent loyalty to\
        \ his sovereign, and of exemplary piety to God, and charity towards the poor,\
        \ and of good affection to learning.\" The dress of the boys from the time\
        \ of Humphrey Chetham, to within a short time ago, resembled that of the scholars\
        \ in Christ's Hospital, London. It consisted of an upper long robe or gown\
        \ of coarse blue cloth with a yellow woollen cloth petticoat underneath, and\
        \ blue worsted stockings ; a small blue cap, like a Highland bonnet, and a\
        \ pair of linen bands. The robe and petticoat were found to be objectionable'\
        \ on the score of cleanliness and health ; and now the boys wear the ordinary\
        \ jacket and trowsers ; only on Sundays they wear the external gown and bands.\
        \ Mr. John Robinson is the present governor, and Mr. Alfred Kay is the schoolmaster\
        \ (1867). The foundations of the college to the north are washed by the Irk,\
        \ near its confluence with the Irwell, and the site is that on which stood\
        \ the summer camp of the Romans and the baronial mansion of the Gresleys.\
        \ The library, which occupies the best room in the building, extends through\
        \ a long gallery, divided into compart ments, and has a commodious and, for\
        \ the student, delightful reading-room attached, in which there are original\
        \ portraits of Humphrey Chetham, the founder ; Dean Nowell, one of the first\
        \ fellows of the college on Queen Elizabeth's foundation (1575), and himself\
        \ a Lancashire benefactor; William Whitaker, president of St. John's College,\
        \ Cambridge ; Robert Bolton, a native of Lancashire, a learned puritan divine,\
        \ and an eminent Greek scholar ; and John Bradford, the Lancashire martyr.\
        \ The feoffees dine in this room'at their general meetings at Easter, in July,\
        \ and in October ; and at the last of these meetings in each year a sermon\
        \ is preached in the Collegiate Church, in commemoration of the founder. The\
        \ present librarian is Mr. Thomas Jones, B. A, F.S. A., and Mr. Richard Hanby\
        \ is the sub-librarian. It has been the singular good fortune of the funds\
        \ of this charity to be well administered through a period of nearly two centuries\
        \ ; and the present feoffees rank amongst the leading persons in this county\

        \ of the duties on advertisements, on newspaper-stamps, and on paper, has\

        \ it appears there is a growing public attraction to these three sources of\
        \ information, interest, and enjoyment. During the year, there were 566,520\
        \ visitors to the museum, and 112,578 volumes have been in use in the reference\
        \ and lending libraries. An exhibition of the works of local artists was opened\
        \ by the mayor on 20th May, and continued open, free, till 7th Seeptember,\
        \ during which it was visited by 289,970 persons. The number of volumes in\
        \ the reference library, 17,973 ; in the library of patents, 2055 ; in the\
        \ lending library, 10,062 ; blue books, magazines, and newspapers (duplicates),\
        \ 780. The issues of books from the reference department have extended over\
        \ 310 days, in which time 62,555 volumes have been delivered to readers, an\
        \ average of 202 volumes per day. The lending department has been open on\
        \ 297 days, and 60,023 volumes have been given out, being an average of 202\
        \ per day. The rooms specially devoted to the valuable set of specifications\
        \ of patents, indexes, and other works relating to patents and to patent law,\
        \ now contain nearly 60,000 separate specifications bound in 2055 volumes.\
        \ This collection of patents has been of very great service to persons residing\
        \ in the neighbourhood and surrounding districts, who are interested in the\
        \ recent inventions and improvements in machinery and new processes of manufacture\
        \ necessary to the progress of industrial science at the present day. In seven\
        \ years past, there have been 47,130 volumes of patents con sulted in the\
        \ room, and since the opening of the patent library rooms in 1854, the total\
        \ number of references (not including the references to the current MS. index\
        \ kept by the librarian) have been 80,492. The total issue of books from the\
        \ lending department during the year is in excess of the issue of the two\
        \ years imme diately preceding. Four-fifths of the works issued in the lending\
        \ library were novels and works of fiction. 535 borrowers had been added during\
        \ the year. In the park, tin- damage dune by the flood of November 1866 had\
        \ been repaired at a cost of about \xA3150, and an obelisk had been placed\
        \ in the centre of the lower grounds to indicate the maximum height of the\
        \ flood. In June, the marble statue, by Noble, of the late Richard Cobden,\
        \ had been inaugurated in the park. The estimated expenditure for the year\
        \ was \xA31215, the actual expenditure \xA31008. The cost of maintaining the\
        \ service of the park for the year was under four-eighths of a penny in the\
        \ pound on the gross assessment of the borough. WORKING People's Association,\
        \ Pendleton. \u2014 The annual meeting of the members of the Pendleton Working\

        \ president of the association, said the average yearly number of members\
        \ during the five years that the association had been in existence was 745.\
        \ During the five years, and up to August last, nearly forty thousand copies\
        \ of the British Workman had been distributed amongst the members. During\
        \ the same period, \xA3246 : 4 : 10 had been paid into the penny bank, and\
        \ the deposits were increasing with such rapidity that during the past four\
        \ months more than \xA340 had been deposited. The temperance meetings had\
        \ been attended during the last three months by an average of 180 persons,\
        \ and 41 had taken the pledge ; and the Band of Hope meetings during the last\
        \ two months had been attended by a nightly average of 255. The average attendance\
        \ at the Saturday evening entertainments had been 350 dur ing the last four\
        \ months. The average attendance at the ragged school had been 410 per night\
        \ for the last three months. Other agencies were, a mothers' meeting, and\
        \ a working men's Bible conversation class, held on Sunday afternoons. The\
        \ advantage of all these agencies was secured by the monthly payment of 2d;\
        \ and from this source \xA3237 : 13 : 8 had been derived during the five years,\
        \ the total cost of carrying on the opera tions of the Association having\
        \ been \xA3863 : 7 : 9. Each yejar's deficiency had been defrayed by friends,\
        \ no balance of debt being carried over to the succeeding year. The reading\

        \ of the clergy. Seven years after he was again imprisoned, \" in violation\
        \ of the most solemn pledges and guaranties.\" The clergy again interfered\
        \ ; from which we may infer that he was a favourite. They even held a public\
        \ feast at Rathbrendan on his behalf ; but he was not released until the following\
        \ year. In the year 1136 we find the obituary of the chief keeper of the calendar\
        \ of Ard-Macha, on the night of Good Friday. He is also mentioned as its chief\
        \ antiquary and librarian, an evidence that the old custom was kept up to\
        \ the very eve of the English invasion. The obituary of Donnell O'Dufly, Archbishop\
        \ of Connacht, is also given. He died after Mass and celebration ; according\
        \ to the Annals of Clonmacnois, he had celebrated Mass by himself, at Clonfert,\
        \ on St. Patrick's Day, and died immediately after. About the same time the\
        \ Breinemen behaved \" so exceed ingly outrageous,\" that they irreverently\
        \ strips O'Daly, arch-poet of Ireland, \" of all his clothes.\" In the meantime\
        \ domestic wars multiplied with extraordinary rapidity. Dermod Mac Murrough,\
        \ the infamous King of Leinster, now appears for the first time in the history\
        \ of that country which he mainly contributed to bring under the English yoke.\
        \ He commenced his career of perfidy by carrying off the Abbess of Kildare\
        \ from her cloister, killing 170 of the people of Kildare, who interfered\
        \ to prevent this wanton and sacrilegious outrage. In 1141 he endeavoured\
        \ to crush the opposers of his atrocious tyranny by a barbarous onslaught,\
        \ in which he killed two nobles, put out the eyes of another, and blinded0\
        \ seventeen chieftains of inferior rank. A fitting commencement of his career\
        \ of treachery towards his unfortunate country ! In 1148 a temporary peace\
        \ was made by the Primate of Armagh, between the northern princes, who had\
        \ carried on a deadly feud ; but its duration, as usual, was brief. Turlough\
        \ O'Brien was deposed by Teigue in 1151. He was assisted by Turlough O'Connor\
        \ and the infamous Dermod. The united armies plundered as far as MoinMor,\"\
        \ where they encountered 6 Blinded. \u2014 In 1165 Henry II. gratified his\
        \ irritation against the Welsh by laying hands upon the hostages of their\
        \ noblest families, and commanding that the eyes of the males should be rooted\
        \ out, and the ears and noses of the females cut off ; and yet Henry is said\
        \ to have been liberal to the poor, and though passionately devoted to the\
        \ chase, he did not inflict either death or mutilation on the intruders in\
        \ the royal forests. 1 Moin Mor. \u2014 Now Moanmore, county Tipperary.",

        \ remaining there for a few minutes, he came on to the ground and tried a\
        \ few bowls, but did not take part in any of the rinks that were playing.\
        \ He was accom panied over the ground by the Mayor of St. Kilda (Dr. Patterson),\
        \ the Mayor of Melbourne, Mr. Lord, and several other gentlemen, and there\
        \ were also present Messrs. Knight and Gilbert, of the Royal Reception Commission.\
        \ Between three and four hundred persons, principally ladies, were within\
        \ the enclosure. After the Prince had viewed the green, he proceeded to plant\
        \ a Wellingtonia Gigantea, in honour and commemoration of his visit, in a\
        \ highly workmanlike manner, a cross with the following inscription being\
        \ placed beside it : \u2014 \"Wellingtonia Gigantea, mammoth pine, a native\
        \ of California, planted 2nd January, 1868, by his Royal Highness the Duke\

        \ he had some refreshment, and in a few minutes left, driving round by the\
        \ esplanade, and then back to Toorak. In the course of the day his Royal Highness\
        \ visited the establishment of Messrs. Johnstone and O'Shannessy, the photographers,\
        \ and sat for his likeness; the artists succeeded in taking some excellent\
        \ portraits of their distinguished patron, one of which forms the frontispiece\
        \ to this work. His Royal Highness also visited the establishment of Mrs.\
        \ Gardner, in Collins-street west, and purchased a large number of furs for\
        \ presentation to members of his family. In the evening the Prince paid another\
        \ visit to the Theatre Royal, where Mr. W. H. Akhurst's deservedly popular\
        \ pantomime, Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son, was performed, with great success,\

        \ Newry, and Captain Standish, arrived shortly before nine o'clock, and occupied\
        \ the right-hand proscenium box. The audience was a most enthusiastic one,\
        \ and when the band played, the National Anthem \u2014 upon the appearance\
        \ of the petit representative of the reigning Sovereign \u2014 the vast concourse\
        \ of people in boxes, pit, and stalls rose en masse, and gave three hearty\
        \ cheers. A ceremony of a most interesting nature took place at the Public\
        \ Library on Friday, 3rd January; a large number of gentlemen who had been\
        \ resident in the colony over twenty-five years, having assembled to present\
        \ an address to his Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh. About sixty-five\
        \ of the fathers of the colony were present altogether, including the Hon.\

        \ Haig, and followed by Mr. Manners- Sutton, Lieutenant Rothwell, and Mr.\

        \ characterised by an attention to those branches of science which have lately\
        \ had a principal place in the studies of naval officers, and it is proud\
        \ to regard this as a prominent reason for requesting the especial con sideration\

        \ Hellenic and Hellenising world, was never even remotely attached to the\
        \ Romano-Alexandrian. The cause lay not in the want of talents or in other\
        \ accidents, least of all in the fact that places in the Museum were bestowed\
        \ by the emperor sometimes according to gifts and always according to favour,\
        \ and the government dealt with them quite as with the horse of the knight\
        \ and the posts of officials of the household ; the case was not otherwise\
        \ at the older courts. Court -philosophers and court-poets remained in Alexandria,\
        \ but not the court ; it was here very clearly apparent that the main matter\
        \ was not pensions and rewards, but the contact \u2014 quickening for both\
        \ sides \u2014 of great political and great scientific work. The latter doubtless\
        \ presented itself for the new monarchy and brought its consequences with\
        \ it ; but the place for it was not Alexandria : this bloom of political develop\
        \ ment justly belonged to the Latins and to the Latin capital. The Augustan\
        \ poetry and Augustan science attained, under similar circumstances, to a\
        \ similar im portant and pleasing development with that attained by the Hellenistic\
        \ at the court of the Pergamenes and the earlier Ptolemies. Even in the Greek\
        \ circle, so far as the Roman government operated upon it in the sense of\
        \ the Lagids, this development was linked more with Rome than with Alexandria.\
        \ It is true that the Greek libraries of the capital were not equal to the\
        \ Alexandrian, and there was no institute in Rome comparable to the Alexandrian\
        \ Museum. But a position at the Roman libraries opened up relations to the\
        \ court. The professorship of Greek rhetoric in the capital, instituted by\
        \ Vespasian, filled up and paid for by the government, gave to its holder,\
        \ although he was not an officer of the household in the same sense as the\
        \ imperial librarian, a similar position, and was regarded, doubtless on that\
        \ account, as the chief professorial chair of the empire.1 But, above all,\
        \ the office of imperial cabinet secretary in its Greek division was the most\
        \ esteemed and the most influential position 1 '0 iva dpbvos in Philostratus,\

        \ at all attain. Transference from the Alexandrian academy to such an office\
        \ in the capital was demonstrably promotion.1 Even apart from all which the\
        \ Greek literati otherwise found in Rome alone, the court-positions and the\
        \ court-offices were enough to draw the most distinguished of them thither\
        \ rather than to the Egyptian \" free table.\" The learned Alexandria of this\
        \ time became a sort of \"jointure\" of Greek science, worthy of respect and\
        \ useful, but of no pervading influence on the great movement of culture or\
        \ mis-culture of the imperial period ; the places in the Museum were, as was\
        \ reasonable, not seldom bestowed on scholars of note from abroad, and for\
        \ the institution itself the books of the library were of more account than\
        \ the burgesses of the great commercial and manufacturing city. The military\
        \ circumstances of Egypt laid down, just as in Syria, a double task for the\
        \ troops there ; the pro tection of the south frontier and of the east coast,\
        \ which indeed may not be remotely compared with that required for the line\
        \ of the Euphrates, and the maintenance of internal order in the country as\
        \ in the capital. The Roman garrison consisted, apart from the ships stationed\
        \ at Alexandria and on the Nile, which seem chiefly to have served for the\
        \ control of the customs, under Augustus of three legions, along with the\
        \ not numerous auxiliary troops belonging to them, about 20,000 men. This\
        \ was about half as many as he destined for all the Asiatic provinces \u2014\
        \ which was in keeping with the importance of this province for the new monarchy.\

        \ in Rome and imperial cabinet secretary (Suidas, I.e. ) ; L. Julius Vestinus\

        \ the Muses did not find them selves at home ; science in earnest and not\
        \ less earnest art were never truly cultivated in Syria and more especially\
        \ in Antioch. However complete was the analogy in other respects between Egypt\
        \ and Syria as to their development, their contrast in a literary point of\
        \ view was sharp ; the Lagids alone entered on this portion of the inheritance\
        \ of Alexander the Great. While they fostered Hellenic literature and promoted\
        \ scientific research in an Aristo telian sense and spirit, the better Seleucids\
        \ doubtless by their political position opened up the East to the Greeks \u2014\
        \ the mission of Megasthenes to king Chandragupta in India on the part of\
        \ Seleucus I., and the exploring of the Caspian Sea by his contemporary the\
        \ admiral Patrocles, were epoch-making in this respect \u2014 but of immediate\
        \ interposition in literary interests on the part of the Seleucids the history\
        \ of Greek literature has nothing more to tell than that Antiochus the Great,\
        \ as he was called, made the poet Euphorion his librarian. Perhaps the history\
        \ of Latin literature may make a claim to serious scientific work on the part\
        \ of Berytus, the Latin island in the sea of Oriental Hellenism. It is perhaps\
        \ no accident that the reaction against the modernising tendency in literature\
        \ of the Julio-Claudian epoch, and the reintroduc tion of the language and\
        \ writings of the republican time into the school as into literature, originated\
        \ with a Bery tian belonging to the middle class, Marcus Valerius Probus,\
        \ who in the schools that were left in his remote home moulded himself still\
        \ on the old classics, and then, in energetic activity more as a critical\

        \ That Roman civilisation pervaded Spain earlier and more powerfully than\

        to command the Massachusetts Brigade. He established temporary headquar ters
        in the State House. He was consulted by the Governor in regard to the movement
        of the troops ; the letters which Colonel Ritchie had written from Washington,
        in February, were read to him ; and the arrangements which had been agreed
        upon by General Scott and the Governor, that troops, when called for, should
        be sent by sea to Annapolis or by the Potomac River to Washington, were made
        known. He was put in possession of all the information which had been obtained
        respecting the movement of troops to Washington by way of Annapolis. On the
        day the requisition for troops came to Governor Andrew, he telegraphed, in
        reply, that the troops would be at once for warded to Annapolis by sea ; to
        which an answer was received from the Secretary of War, to " send the troops
        by railroad : they will arrive quicker, the route through Baltimore is now
        open." In consequence of this despatch, the route was changed, and the Sixth
        Regiment was forwarded by rail, although, through the activity and foresight
        of John M. Forbes, steamers were in readiness to take the regiment by sea.
        Had the route not been changed, the bloodshed in Baltimore on the ever-memora
        ble 19th of April would have been avoided. How the Secre tary of War could
        have believed the route through Baltimore was safe, it is difficult to understand,
        if, as may have been supposed, he was aware of the schemes which were planned
        in Baltimore to assassinate Mr. Lincoln, when on his way to Washington to
        be inaugurated, and which were thwarted by the prudence, vigilance, and accurate
        knowledge of one man. The true history of Mr. Lincoln''s perilous journey
        to Wash ington in 1861, and the way he escaped death, have never been made
        public until now. The narrative was written by Samuel M. Felton, of Philadelphia,
        President of the Philadelphia and Baltimore Railroad Company, in 1862, at
        the request of Mr. Sibley, Librarian of Harvard University ; but it was not
        com pleted until lately, when it was sent to me, with other valuable material,
        by Mr. Felton. It has a direct bearing upon events which transpired in forwarding
        the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment to Washington, and which are now to be narrated.

        \ \" Prescot Rectory, both as to the old rents, and an estimate of the thirteen\
        \ several tithes demised thereunto. Where it appears, that the sum total of\
        \ the value was then, in January 1586, near \xA3500 per annum.\"3 James I,\
        \ by a charter dated October 1, in the 12th year of his reign (1614), ratified\
        \ and confirmed former charters. To this king, influenced by the accidental\
        \ discovery of a silver horse-shoe belonging to the rector of Prescot, is\
        \ attributed the institution of the vicarage, of which the same authority\
        \ declares Bishop Booth to have been the founder in a preceding reign. 'S\
        \ King James, it is said, when on a visit to the earl of Derby at Knowsley,4\
        \ was riding alone in a country lane, when he saw something lying in one of\
        \ the ruts, which, by its glittering in the sun, attracted his attention.\
        \ His curiosity being excited, tin king alighted from his horse, and finding\
        \ it to be a silver horse-shoe, he put it into his pocket, not doubting that\
        \ it belonged to the earl, or some of the nobles in his company. Accordingly,\
        \ after dinner his majesty produced the horse-shoe, and inquired who was its\
        \ owner ; when, to his great astonishment, it was claimed by the rector of\
        \ Prescot. ' ' Well, \" said the king, ' ' if the produce of your rectory\
        \ is such as to enable you to shoe your horse with silver, it is time that\
        \ money so wasted was appropriated to better purposes. \" Whereupon the king\
        \ commanded that the great tithes should be given to the King's College, Cambridge,\
        \ and they are the rectors to this day. The church of Prescot, dedicated to\
        \ St. Maiy, existed in the thirteenth century, and was estimated at \xA340\
        \ in the Valor of Pope Nicholas. The present edifice consists of a centre\
        \ and side aisles, and a chancel with a tower, crowned by a spire, 156 feet\
        \ high, visible in the low parts of Cheshire and this county at a distance\
        \ of many miles. The body of the fabric on tfee north and south has been rebuilt\
        \ with long windows, in which there is but little tracery. On the south side\
        \ of the chancel parts of the walls of a more distant age are visible ; and\
        \ in the central roof, the vestry, and some parapets, other evidence of a\
        \ more ancient structure is discerned. The interior is spacious and lofty\
        \ : the nave is divided from the side aisles by five arches on each side,\
        \ resting upon columns with plain capitals. The wood-work of the roof is carved\
        \ at the intersections of the beams. The organ was the gift of Mrs. Atherton,\
        \ the widow of William Atherton, esq., both of whom are interred here. The\
        \ earliest date in the church is 1610, at which time it was pewed, elevated,\
        \ and newly roofed, partly at the expense, it is said, of John Ogle of Whiston\
        \ Hall, esq., one of the captains who defended Lathom House. In 1729 the tower\
        \ was taken down and rebuilt with a spire at the expense of the parish. The\
        \ spire, having been shattered by lightning, was rebuilt in 1799. The north\
        \ and south wings or aisles were re-erected in 1819-20 by three contractors,\
        \ who undertook the work for the rents of the pews in the galleries, of which\
        \ there are three. Numerous monuments are contained in the interior. Above\
        \ one of the pillars, on the north side of the chancel, is a shield carved\
        \ in stone, with the initials and date M.E. 1610. On the north side of the\
        \ chancel is a large upright figure of Captain John Ogle, in the costume of\
        \ the seventeenth century, with his right hand upon his breast, and above\
        \ his head are the family arms with the motto, \" Veritas vincit.\" An exuberantly\

        \ of any great note have been printed in this town, though several men of\
        \ literary eminence have received their education here. The town of Preston\
        \ is indebted for Shepherd's Library to an alderman of this borough, Eichard\
        \ Shepherd, a physician of eminence, who died on the 4th of December 1761,\
        \ bequeathing, by will dated June 18, 1759, \"all and every of his books,\
        \ of what nature or kind soever, to bis executors, in trust, for the mayor\
        \ and aldermen of the borough, or corporation of Preston ;\" and confiding\
        \ to the said mayor and aldermen the power to give to any person they should\
        \ direct the privilege to read or inspect such books. The testator further\
        \ bequeathed \xA3200, to be placed out at interest, and to be applied by the\
        \ mayor and aldermen to the purpose of paying the librarian's salary; and\
        \ the interest of the residue, being \xA31000, arising out of his personal\
        \ estates, he directed to be applied by them in purchasing books for enlarging\
        \ and increasing the library. After being for some time deposited in a room\
        \ in Shepherd Street, a room for them was erected adjoining the Grammar school\
        \ in that street, and was open at stated hours for the admission of persons,\
        \ by ticket from the mayor or any of the aldermen. From 1851 to 1868, the\
        \ library was housed in the Institu tion for the Diffusion of Knowledge. In\
        \ the latter year the corporation purchased a building in Cross Street, erected\
        \ for the Literary and Philosophical Institution, which, after an existence\
        \ of twenty-seven years, was then closed. Important as was Dr. Shepherd's\
        \ munificent donation, it must be obvious that even if it was open without\
        \ restriction, it would by no means be equal to the literary requirements\
        \ of a town like Preston. Under the influence of this persuasion, a public\
        \ library was established in 1825, in Fishergate, named the \"Palatine Library.\"\
        \ This was afterwards merged in the above-named Literary and Philosophical\
        \ Institution. The principal literary society of the town now is the Institution\
        \ for the Diffusion of Knowledge, which resembles in its principal features\
        \ a mechanics' institute. This excellent establishment consists of a library\
        \ with 7000 volumes, a museum of natural history and miscellaneous rarities,\
        \ and a large collection of insects formed by Mr. William Helme, a weaver,\
        \ and a reading and lecture room for the accommodation of the members. The\
        \ first hall of the society was in Cannon Street, and was opened in October\
        \ 1828, and the number of subscribers during the first year was from six to\
        \ eight hundred. In 1849 it, was removed to new premises at Avenham, erected\
        \ at a cost of \xA36000. There is also a Law Library, established in 1833,\
        \ in which a society for the discussion of legal subjects holds its meetings.\
        \ Before the establishment of the recently defunct Literary and Philosophical\
        \ Institution in Winckley Square, an institute of this name existed for some\
        \ years, which originated as early as 1810; and, at a later period, 1834,\
        \ a Society of Arts was formed, which, however, gradually declined. The Dispensary\
        \ was established in 1809, and a house of recovery connected with it in 1813.\
        \ This house was near Trinity church. A House of Recovery, in Deepdale Road,\
        \ was erected in 1833, in con nection with the Poor-law establishment. A noble\
        \ hospital, \" The Preston and Lancashire Royal Infirmary,\" was commenced\

        \ Mr. Law, minister of a small chapel in the neigh- bourhood of Cartmel, descended\
        \ from an ancient family long resident at Askham, in Westmoreland. He was\
        \ born in the year 1703, and was educated for some time at Cartmel School,\
        \ and afterwards at the Free Grammar School of Kendal, and from thence proceeded\
        \ to Saint John's College, Cambridge. In 1723 he took his degree of Bachelor\
        \ of Arts, and was soon after elected Fellow of Christ's College, and in 1727\
        \ proceeded Master. During his residence here, Mr. Law became known to the\
        \ public by a transla- tion of Archbishop King's essay on the Origin of Evil,\
        \ with copious notes. He also, while at Cambridge, undertook and went through\
        \ a very laborious part in preparing for the press an edition of Stephens's\
        \ Thesaurus. His acquaintance during his first residence at the University\
        \ was principally with 1 >r. Waterland, the learned .Master of Magdalen College,\
        \ Dr. Jortin, a name known to every reader, and Dr. Taylor, the editor of\
        \ Demosthenes. In\"l737 he was presented by the University t.. the living\
        \ of Graystock, in the county of Cumberland, a rectory of about \xA3300 per\
        \ annum. The advowson of this benefice belonged to the family of Howards of\
        \ Graystock, but devolved to the University, for this turn, bv virtue of an\
        \ act of parliament, which transfers to these two bodies the nomination to\
        \ such benefices as appertain, at the time of the vacancy, to the patronage\
        \ of a Roman < nth. .lie. The right, however, of the University was contested,\
        \ and it was not till after a law-suit of two years' continuance that Mr.\
        \ Law was settled in hi^ living. In 1743 he was promoted to the archdeaconry\
        \ of Carlisle, and in 1746 went from Graystock to reside at Salkeld, a pleasant\
        \ village on the banks of the river Eden, the rectory of w nich is annexed\
        \ to the archdeaconry. Mr. Law was not one of those \xBB ho lose and forget\
        \ themselves in the country. During his residence at Salkeld he published\
        \ \"Considerations on the Theory of Re- ligion,\" to which were subjoined\
        \ \" Reflections on the Life and Character of Christ ; and an Appendix concerning\
        \ the use of the words Soul and Spirit in Holy Scripture, and the state of\
        \ the Dead there described.\" In 1749 he took his degree of Doctor of Divinity,\
        \ bul with considerable opposition, on account of the doctrines expressed\
        \ in his Thesis on \" The Sleep of the Soul,\" from Archbishops Herring and\
        \ Potter, and several of the heads of houses. In 1754 he was ele.-ted Master\
        \ of St. Peter's College, i lambridge, and resigne I his archdeaconry inn\
        \ liaf.lv afterwards. About the year 1760 he was appoint.-.! head librarian\
        \ of the University. s..me time alter this he was also appointed Professor\
        \ of ( 'asuistry. In the year 1762 he suffered an irreparable loss by the\
        \ death of his wife, Mary, . laughter of John i Ihristian of Unerigg, in the\
        \ county of Cumberland, esq., a loss rendered more afflicting by the situation\
        \ of his family of eleven children, many of them very fn the course of the\
        \ next few years he received several preferments, whii h were rather honourable\
        \ expressions of regard fiom his friends than ..f much advantage' to his fortune.\
        \ By Dr. Cornwallis, then bishop of Lichfield, afterwards archbishop of Canter-\
        \ bury win. had been his pupil at Christ's College, he was appointed to the\
        \ archdeaconry of Staffordshire, aud to a prebend in the church of Lichfield.\
        \ By his old acquaintance, Dr. Green, bishop of Lincoln, he was also mad.-\
        \ a prebendary of thai .hureh. But in the year 1767, by the intervention of\
        \ the duk.- of Newcastle, to \\\\ln.s.- interest, in the memorable contest\
        \ for the high- stewardship of the University, he had adhered in opposition\
        \ to Borne temptations, he obtained a stall in Durham cathedral. The year\
        \ aft.-r thi-, the duke of Grafton, who had a short time before been elected\
        \ chancellor of the University, recommended him for tin- bishopric of Carlisle,\
        \ not only without his solicitati rthat of his friends, but without his knowledge.\
        \ In 1777 Dr., no. Bishop, Law gave to the public a handsome edition, in three\
        \ volumes quarto, of the Works of Mr. Locke, with a Life of the Author, and\

        \ of the natural beauty of the place, but because it restored him to the county\
        \ in which he had spent the best part of his life. In the year 17 8 7 he paid\

        \ its great merchants spread throughout the world ; and in keeping with this\
        \ was the refined luxury of manners, the castanet-players who were here at\
        \ home, and the Gaditanian songs, which circulated, like those of Alex andria,\
        \ among the elegant Romans. The nearness of Italy, and the easy and cheap\
        \ intercourse by sea, gave at this epoch, especially to the Spanish south\
        \ and east coasts, the opportunity of bringing their rich produce to the first\
        \ market of-the world, and probably with no country in the world did Rome\
        \ pursue so extensive and constant a traffic on a great scale as with Spain.\
        \ That Roman civilisation pervaded Spain earlier and more powerfully than\
        \ any other province, is confirmed by evidence on various sides, especially\
        \ in respect to religion and to literature. It is true that in the territory\
        \ that was still at a later period Iberian, and remained tolerably free from\
        \ immigra tion \u2014 in Lusitania, Callaecia, Asturia \u2014 the native gods,\
        \ with their singular names, ending mostly in -icus and -ecus, such as Endovellicus,\
        \ Eaecus, Vagodonnaegus, and the like, maintained their ground still even\
        \ under the principate at the old seats. But not a single votive stone has\
        \ been found in all Baetica, which might not quite as well have been set up\
        \ in Italy. And the same holds true of Tarraconensis proper, only that isolated\
        \ traces are met with on the upper Douro of the worship of Celtic gods.1 No\
        \ other province shows an equally energetic Romanising in matters of ritual.\
        \ Cicero mentions the Latin poets at Corduba only to censure them ; and the\
        \ Augustan age of literature was still in the main the work of Italians, though\
        \ individual provincials helped in it, and among others the learned librarian\
        \ of the emperor, the philologue Hyginus, was born as a bondsman in Spain.\
        \ But thenceforward the Spaniards undertook in it almost the part, if not\
        \ of leader, at any rate of schoolmaster. The natives of Corduba, Mar- 1 At\
        \ Clunia there was found a dedication to the Mothers (C. I. L. ii. 2776) \u2014\
        \ the only Spanish example of this worship so widely diffused and so long\
        \ continuing among the western Celts \u2014 at Uxama, one set up to the lugoz'es\

        \ the Con stitutional Convention of 1853, provided the town would give a like\
        \ sum for the same purpose. At March Meeting, 1855, the town voted to accept\
        \ Mr. Winn's offer; and appropriated the sum of three hundred dollars, to\
        \ be expended, with Mr. Winn's donation, in the purchase of books for a public\
        \ library. It likewise authorized the Selectmen to draw from the treasury\
        \ such additional sums as might be found necessary to providing a room for\
        \ the proposed library, and fitting it up with suitable con veniences. It\
        \ also chose a committee of seven persons, and gave them full powers, on the\

        \ a librarian, and to establish all necessary By-Laws, Rules and Regulations\

        Librarian to the Corporation of the City of London, says, in his Dictionary
        of Chronology ; or Historical and Statistical Register : " The name of this
        Court is derived from the arches below St. Mary-le-Bow Church, Cheapside."
        The same authority further informs his reader : " All ecclesiastical suits
        were held here until the removal of the Court to Doctors'' Commons in the
        middle of the 1 6th century," though we are told that " Occasional Courts
        were held at Bow Church down to the year 1825." Some general measure for the
        reform of this and the other Ecclesiastical Courts, such as for consolidating
        their jurisdiction and improving their practice, is almost certain to be passed
        sooner or later. Expense would be saved, and justice better administered,
        if litigants in any contested suit in any Ecclesiastical Court, either in
        the Province of Canterbury or in the Province of York, had the right to remove
        such suit into the Arches Court of Canterbury ; and if the Court of Arches
        were consolidated with the Prerogative and Consistorial Courts of Canterbury,
        by transferring the jurisdiction of the latter Courts to the Court of Arches.
        In 1840, a reform was effected, to empower the Dean of Arches to sit as assistant
        to or in place of the Judge of the Court of Admiralty. The High Court of Admiralty.
        This Court, which has hitherto been usually held at Doctors'' Commons, was
        instituted by Edward III. It is a Sovereign Court, supposed to be held by
        the Lord High Admiral, or Lords of the Admiralty, for taking cognisance of
        all maritime affairs, whether civil or criminal ; and its proceedings are
        according to the method of civil law. Being of a two-fold character it consists
        of two Courts, the Instance Court and the Prize Court. The latter is a tribunal
        for naval captures in war ; the former has a criminal and civil jurisdiction

        has come to be Stamford. Our first spelling of the modern names, it will be
        seen, is Stanforde ; and we may, without serious misgiving, ac cept as its
        prototype, the ancient Stanforde in the Wapentake of Ness. We have already
        alluded to the local records from which a portion of these details are drawn.
        But quite as fortunate is it, that so many of the papers of the town have
        been preserved by the care of the state. But for the aid of these papers,
        now ar ranged and indexed in the state library in Hartford, but few of the
        older towns of the state could furnish material for an intel ligible record
        of their local history. Certainly, Stamford, one of the oldest of these towns,
        is greatly indebted to this state providence for many of the records which
        this history pre serves. Next to these sources of our history, stand the ecclesiastical
        records of the First Church and those of the Middlesex Church and Society,
        (Darien) ; the former commencing with Dr. Welles'' ministry in 1747, and the
        latter with the organization of the Society in 1739. It must always be regretted
        that the records of the First Church, down to the settlement of Dr. Welles,
        are not to be re covered. The Society records of that period are identical
        with such town records as are preserved, and are scarcely less va lua ble
        to the history than those of the town itself. Next in value are those faithful
        transcripts of the records of the Xew Raven colony, from 1038 to 1649, and
        from 1653 to 1665, published by C. J. Hoadly, Esq., State librarian ; and
        a like faithful transcript of the Connecticut colony records, from 1636 to
        1677, executed by J. Hammond Trumbull, Esq, Secre tary of State. Xor should
        the old Dutch records of the Xew Netherlands be lost sight of in this research.
        Of the history of this region, anterior to the date when our colonial records
        be gin, and of the earlier conflicts with the Aborigines, they give us many
        facts and hints of great interest.', 1]

        and Russia and tree-calf, and its thin librarian (a French abbe and a famous
        mathematician), seated at a table in a bay window, so absent from the world
        that the pane of glass was put in without his knowledge. The librarian was

        \ Africa. In an evil hour for himself he unfortunately joined the Livingstone\
        \ expedition, in a situation for which he had no qualification whatever. As\
        \ a store keeper he was the wrong man in the right place. As an artist and\
        \ explorer, or astrono mer, his services were invaluable. Sir Roderick Murchison,\
        \ in an address de livered before the Royal Geographical Society, declared\
        \ that with an artist like Mr. Baines, who has sent home such admirable coloured\
        \ drawings of South African scenes, particularly of the falls of the Zambesi,\
        \ those of us who are destined never to penetrate into the southern part of\
        \ Africa may quite realize to our mind's eye the true characters of that grand\
        \ continent. These pictures, purchased by Robert White, Esq., of London, have\
        \ been seen and admired by thousands in the picture gallery of the Crystal\
        \ Palace, and subsequently at the Dublin Exhibi tion, and at the Alexandra\
        \ Palace. Dr. Kirk highly applauded them, and Sir George Grey, in a note to\
        \ the mother of the artist, stated \" that Her Majesty expressed much pleasure\
        \ in in specting them, and allowed the work to be dedi cated to the Prince\
        \ Consort.\" Nor was this all, Mr. Glover, the librarian, declared that he\
        \ never saw the prince more interested in anything of the kind than the paintings.\
        \ They kept them at Windsor a week ; and Her Majesty took her children into\
        \ the room in which they were placed, and explained them to her children.\

        \ observes, \"the death of this brave and distin guished man, whose name must\
        \ for ever be associated with the explorers of the country north of the Cape\
        \ Colony in the same rank as Livingstone, Chapman, Andersson, and Green, has\

        \ and diligently in the careful elabora tion of plans and the acquisition\
        \ of the scientific knowledge of this splendid wilderness, this fearless and\
        \ accomplished man has, like Anders son and Livingstone, impressed the native\
        \ mind with a conviction of English courage and super iority, and has now\
        \ gone to his rest unrecognized and unrewarded, but not unlamented. If his\
        \ value was unappreciated by the many, his friend ship was prized by a few,\
        \ and had not his death deprived Africa of a fund of information in re gard\
        \ to these regions, it would be needless for us to write these lines. As it\
        \ is, we shall say but little of the Matabele proper, where the gold fields\
        \ lie, but refer the reader to the work of Mr. Baines on this subject, wherein\
        \ will be found full descriptions of the old mines and the native races who\
        \ now occupy the land.\" So far the writer in the Cape Magazine, and as an\
        \ old and faithful friend of poor Baines of more than thirty years' duration,\
        \ we can only say, \"And such an honest chronicler is Griffith;\" for we can\
        \ fully endorse every word he says in praise of that truly honest-hearted,\
        \ unselfish, generous, and simple-minded specimen of human ity, Thomas Baines,\
        \ who was always in the front performing acts of kindness to his fellow labourers*\
        \ whether in sickness, semi-starvation, or any other difficulty they might\
        \ be in, and died with the happy recollection that he was to his or their\
        \ end the participator in the love and friendship of such men as Charles J.\

        \ The Mercantile Library, situated in Astor Place, formerly known as the As-\
        \ tor Place Opera House, and now called Clinton Hall, was founded in 1820.\
        \ The first meeting was called by Wm. Wood, Esq. , by a notice posted at the\
        \ Commercial Advertiser office, and dated Nov. 3d of that year, to be held\
        \ on the 9th at the Tontine Coffee Room House to consider a plan for establishing\
        \ a Li- brary and Reading Room. The call was addressed to the clerks of South\
        \ street, Front street, Pearl street and Maiden Lane. About two hundred persons\
        \ attended this jneeting and it resulted in the adop- tion of a constitution\
        \ dn the 27th, and the election of officers. The Library was opened in February,\
        \ 1821, at No. 49 Fulton street, with 700 volumes and 150 members. In 1826\
        \ the Library was removed to the building of Messrs. Harper & Bros. in Cliff\
        \ street, at which time it contained 6,000 volumes. In 1828 a subscription\
        \ was started among the merchants of New York to raise funds to erect a new\
        \ building for the use of the Library. The new building was built on the corner\
        \ of Beekinan and Nassau streets, and was dedicated Nov. 2d, 1860, under the\
        \ name of Clinton Hall. Twenty years later it was found that the collection\
        \ of books had become too large for the space afforded by Clinton Hall, and\
        \ it therefore became necessary to provide other quarters. After a long contest\
        \ between two factions, one favoring removal up town and tbe other opposing\
        \ it, the Astor Place Opera House was purchased and fitted up and the Lib\
        \ ary removed into it in 1854. From this time its present prosperity began\
        \ to date. It now contains 160,000 volumes, and in the number of its books\
        \ ranks as the fourth library in size in the United States. The reading room\
        \ is furnished with over 450 newspapers and magazines. The executive foroe\
        \ num- bers twenty odd clerks under the charge of the Librarian, Mr. W. T.\

        \ none who followed them attained to their eminence. The buildings they erected\
        \ are history as much as their con quests. In the stones of Karnak we see\
        \ the plunder and the tribute of Asia and Ethiopia. Many a city had been made\
        \ a desolate heap, . and many a fair region had been ravaged, and the silver\
        \ and gold col lected, and the surviving inha bitants swept into the Egyptian\
        \ net, and carried away captive into Egypt, to assist in building the grand\
        \ hypostyle Court of Karnak, the grandest hall ever constructed by man.' On\
        \ the western or Libyan side of the Nile, there are monuments of the grandeur\
        \ of Thebes, which, though not of the same stupendous magnitude, are perhaps\
        \ equally interesting. They present, on their smaller scale, architecture,\
        \ and painted sculpture of the same character, equally excellent, and in many\
        \ cases still better preserved. This is particularly observable in regard\
        \ to the brilliancy of the gold, the ultramarine, and other colours. ' There\
        \ are no buildings in the world so full of actually written and pictured history,',\
        \ says Mr. Zincke, 'as these temple-palaces, for each of them contains records\
        \ of the achievements and life of the builder as they were regarded by himself,\
        \ and of his religion as it was understood by himself. The grandest of these\
        \ monu ments is the Memnonium, or, as it ought to be called, the Rameseum.\
        \ Here lived the great Rameses. He designed it, built it, and made it his\
        \ home. He built it after his great Asiatic campaigns. How often here must\
        \ he have fought his battles o'er again ! Every thing here is grand, \u2014\
        \ the lofty propylons, the Osirid court, tlie great halls, and above all,\
        \ the colossal statue of the king seated on his throne, a monolith of red\
        \ granite weighing nearly 900 tons, and which is now lying on the ground in\
        \ stu pendous fragments, its over throw having been probably the work of the\
        \ revengeful Persians. It included even a spacious library, on the walls of\
        \ which were sculptured figures of the god of letters and of the god of memory.\
        \ Over the door by which it was entered was the fa mous inscription, \"Themedicine\
        \ ofthe mind.\" By a concurrence of happy chances, papyrus-rolls have been\
        \ found, dated from this library ; and in the Hager behind have been discovered\
        \ the tombs of some of the royal librarians.' The temple-palace of Sethos,\
        \ the father of Rameses, another of these monuments, is much smaller than\
        \ the Rameseum, but the sculptures on its walls are in the freest and boldest\
        \ style, relating chiefly to religious acts and ceremonies. The third temple-palace\
        \ is that of Rameses in., which is in better preservation. Within it are the\
        \ ruins of a Coptic", 1]

        \ v. The present build ing, however, was erected by Sixtus v. in 1588, and\
        \ the lib rary now contains above 50,000 printed volumes and 24,000 manuscripts,\
        \ amongst which is the Codex Vaticanus or Greek Bible of the end of the fourth\
        \ or beginning of the fifth century, the most important document, perhaps,\
        \ in biblical literature. The antechambers of the lib rary are hung with portraits\
        \ of the librarians, among which, in the first room, is that of Car dinal\
        \ Mezzofanti. Its great hall is decorated with frescoes, which produce a fine\

        \ the successors of Philip, especially by Charles v., who placed in it the\
        \ royal col lection of books, which became the nucleus of the Royal Lib rary,\
        \ and fitted it up as a palace, providing it with gardens and terraces. Under\
        \ Charles vi., and down to the time of Louis xn., it was converted into a\
        \ fortress. During the reign of Francis 1., plans for the improve ment of\
        \ the building were de signed by Pierre Lescot, and were executed, chiefly\
        \ in the reign of Henry II., by that artist, aided by Jean Goujon and Paul\
        \ Poncino. About this period the west side of the court, known as the old\
        \ Louvre, was finished, and the south wing, stretching along the Seine, was\
        \ begun. While Henry n. and his queen, Catherine de Medicis, occupied the\
        \ Louvre, their eldest son married Mary Stuart, afterwards Queen of Scots.\
        \ ' Upon the day,' says A. E. Challice, 'when her marriage with Francis, then\
        \ called the \" Roy Dauphin,\" was celebrated, the young queen bride appeared,\

        \ adds that she had, pour fair mieux embrasserle monde, a sweet voice, and\
        \ that sometimes she accom panied this voice with the lute, 78. THE LOUVRE\
        \ AND TUILERIES. The Louvre, an ancient palace of the French monarchs, although\
        \ it has long ceased to be a royal habitation, is one of the noblest palatial\
        \ structures in Europe. Its origin is lost in obscurity, but it is supposed\
        \ to have been originally a hunting lodge, upon the site of which a tower\
        \ was erected by Philip Augustus in 12 14, to serve as a state prison and\
        \ arsenal. Ac cording to some authorities, its name is derived from the chasse\
        \ au loup, wolf hunt ; and ac cording to others, from the old Saxon word louver,\

        \ linguist, is a good humoured, civil man, but it is contrary to the rules\
        \ of the establishment to allow any but the ecclesiastically qualified to\
        \ peruse the catalogue, so that it is next to impossible to know by any direct\
        \ means whether any articles one may be in search of has a place in its columns\
        \ or no. If you ask for a particular work they will shew it you, and with\
        \ proper authority allow you to con sult or transcribe it. As far as I could\
        \ ascertain, neither the works of St. Inan nor the Chart ulary of Kilwinning\
        \ are among its treasures. AA^hen I left Rome, however, I commissioned a young\
        \ German friend of mine, a professional savant who has been several years\
        \ engaged in the Library and is high in the graces of the Managers, to make\
        \ more accurate inquiries; and Dr. Wiseman, Principal of the English College,\
        \ and a fully privileged person, promised to do the same; but I have as yet\
        \ heard nothing farther from either of them. \" F.S. \u2014 There is a very\
        \ considerable collection of MSS. in the public library here. I read through\
        \ the catalogue and noted one or two things which I thought might bear upon\
        \ Scottish history and antiquities ; but, alas ! on application for a sight\
        \ of them, I found that the arrange ment of the collection existed but on\
        \ paper, and that the Codici themselves were in the same state of confusion\
        \ as their betters in the metropolis. The Librarians, it is true, are exerting\
        \ themselves with similar zeal in restoring order, but I fear the duration\
        \ of my sojourn here will not permit of my reaping the benefit of their labours.\"\
        \ It is not at all likely that more will ever be known of the writings of\
        \ St. Inan. The other annual fairs held in Beith are kept on the first Fridays\
        \ of January, February, May, and November, O.S. There used formerly to be\
        \ a fair in June, called the \" Trades' Race,\" on which the Trades assembled,\
        \ and walked in procession through the town with music and flags. The procession\
        \ terminated at the Cross, where, forming a circle, the party drank the King's\
        \ health, and after some other toasts, separated. On the following day the\
        \ Merchants of the Town assembled, and walked in procession, and at its close\
        \ met at the Cross, where they drank the King's health, and danced some reels.\
        \ They then retired to an Inn and dined. The furnishing of the dinner was\
        \ generally competed for among the Innkeepers, and the first dish put on the\
        \ table was invariably barley broth in which raisins were boiled, from which\
        \ this dish got the name of \" raisin kail.\" These processions and dance\
        \ have been given up for many years, but the convivial part of the ceremony\
        \ is still retained, and the annual dinner continues to be respect ably attended.\
        \ This Society is of some standing. They have a regular Minute Book, from\
        \ which it appears that they were constituted as a Society prior to 1727;\
        \ and it is said, that at their first institution they held a Charter from\
        \ the Earl of Eglinton. They have a set of useful rules, which are in verse,\
        \ and are read over to the new Members at their initiation. The President\
        \ is annually elected, and during the festival is styled \" My Lord.\" This\
        \ Society comprehends all the Merchants and Traders in town. Every one who\
        \ commences business is called upon, at the return of the festival, and in\
        \ some degree compelled, to enter. Founding upon the long continuance of the\
        \ custom, the Office-bearers have considered themselves entitled to use compulsory\
        \ means to make the new Merchant join their Society, and failing his doing\
        \ so, to seize, brevi vianu, his goods to the value of the entry-money. On\
        \ a principle of this kind, it was decided by the Court of Session, in the\
        \ case of Callender, nth July, 1672 (M.D. 10892), that \" forty years possession\

        \ and anti quarian pursuits, and overtook a journey to Greece, an interesting\
        \ account of which he afterwards published, and which was received by the\
        \ literary public with much appro bation. His attention having been called\
        \ to the writings of St. Inan, he instituted a search after them, the result\
        \ of which he communicated to the writer of these notes in the following letter:\
        \ \u2014 \" Siena, 4th August, 1837. \" I trust you have attributed my delay\
        \ to answer your letter, received some months ago, to the right cause \u2014\
        \ namely, my anxiety to be able to communicate something satisfactory relative\
        \ to the matter concerning which you make inquiry. I fear you will think,\
        \ on perusing this, that my delay ,however well intentioned, has missed its\
        \ object; but as I have now brought my researches relative to the remains\
        \ of our venerable parish Saint to a point, which, if a satisfactory result\
        \ be possible, promises to direct me towards it, I shall not keep you any\
        \ longer in suspense. The Archbishop Bonci, concerning whom you write, died\
        \ in 1619; he was a person of some literary repute in his day, of a noble\
        \ family of Florence, and at his death bequeathed a valuable collec tion of\
        \ books and MSS. to the Dominican Monks of Santa Maria Novella in that city.\
        \ As soon as I had ascertained these particulars, presuming that the library\
        \ of that establishment, like others under similar circumstances, had, during\
        \ the political and literary revolutions of the last half century, been confiscated\
        \ and destined to augment the national institutions of the country in which\
        \ it was domiciled, I wrote to a friend at Florence, requesting him to make\
        \ inquiries, and to ascertain, if possible, whether the treasures of Sta.\
        \ M. Novella, and the works of St. Inan in particular, were now to be heard\
        \ of in any of the numerous public libraries which that capital contains,\
        \ and the most distinguished of which are the Laurentiana, Riccardiana, and\
        \ Magliabec chiana. I was at Florence myself for a few days last week, but\
        \ had neither time nor opportunity to do anything in person further than ascertaining\
        \ that my friend had already set his researches on foot in a tolerably systematic\
        \ manner, and obtaining from him a report of his progress and a promise that\
        \ he would not relax his exertions as long as there was any hope of success.\
        \ He had ascertained, both from the ecclesiastics of the reduced establishment\
        \ of Sta. Maria and from the Librarian of the Laurentian, that the collection\
        \ in question had been made over to the Govern ment, and distributed, it would\
        \ appear, in lots among the principal public libraries. But his authority\
        \ at the Convent said at the same time, that it was a very doubtful matter\
        \ whether the articles sought for would now be forthcoming, as during the\
        \ transfer, what from mismanagement or malversation on the part of those engaged\
        \ in carrying it into effect, many of these codices most remarkable for antiquity\
        \ or curiosity had been lost or purloined, \u2014 thus, then, we have obstacle\
        \ first. Obstacle the second is, that these public institutions, more especially\
        \ the departments of the MSS., from the great difficulty of introducing or\
        \ preserving order and arrangement, are in a very lamentable state of confusion.\
        \ This is the case, as I know by experi ence, with most of the literary treasures\
        \ of the country from the great want of industry, talent, or enterprise on\
        \ the part of the functionaries entrusted with their management, combined\
        \ with a jealousy of interference from quarters better qualified to turn them\
        \ to account. My friend had nearly ascertained that the works of St. Inan\
        \ were not extant among the MSS. of the existing catalogue of the Laurentian;\
        \ but, at the same time, was informed that a very large proportion of the\
        \ collection, comprising probably the bulk of those of Sta. Maria, was as\
        \ yet unexplored. This chaos, indeed, is said to be in a progressive state\
        \ of organisation, but from the progress now making it may be several years\
        \ before you have any great chance of obtaining, if ever, a satisfactory answer\
        \ to your queries. In the Riccardiana my friend had not pushed his researches\
        \ quite so far, but had been given to understand that matters stood there\
        \ on a similar or still more disadvantageous footing. If these relics are\
        \ to be found at all, it will probably be in one or other of these collections,\
        \ as being more specially privileged as receptacles of antiquarian or historical\
        \ curiosities. I have taken a house at Florence for the ensuing winter, and\
        \ shall, when on the spot, do my best in person to fulfil your commission.\
        \ \"With respect to the Vatican Library, the jealousy of interference is so\
        \ great, and the consequent difficulties and discomforts attending any efforts\
        \ to fathom its mysteries so formidable, that I had not the courage to under-\

        & Penniman was the first one established in Troy. Here the citizens were supplied
        with all the standard works and choice literature of that period. This firm
        were also the first to suggest to the public a plan for the estab lishment
        of a circulating library, for, in November, 1799, a subscrip tion list was
        opened at their store for this purpose in which it was announced that the
        library would consist of one thousand volumes, for the use of which each subscriber
        was to pay annually eight dol lars. To this appeal the citizens generally
        responded, and a suffi cient sum of money was raised for the purchase of the
        necessary books. Under an Act of the Legislature, passed April r, 1796, a
        meeting was called at the house of Jeremiah Pierce, on Tuesday, January 10th,
        1800, at which the following persons were elected " Trustees of the Troy Library
        " : Benjamin Tibbits, Christopher Hutton, John Woodworth, Jonas Coe, Aaron
        Lane, David Buel and Jeremiah Osborne. On the 21st of January, Rev. Jonas
        Coe was elected Chairman, and on the 14th of March following, Zephaniah Filer
        was appointed Treasurer and Librarian, and Jeremiah Os borne, Clerk. Among
        the last of the oldest firms of Lansingburgh to remove to Troy was that of
        Aaron and Derick Lane in 1799. As were all the others, so were they also compelled
        to acknowledge that the site of Troy possessed local advantages which the
        former village could never secure, and that all the past predictions relative
        to the business success of the latter, made by observant travelers and by
        other un biased and discriminating persons, had been gradually, and at the
        same time, rapidly verified. The members of this notable firm, im mediately
        on their arrival, enlisted themselves in an active participa tion with all
        the other enterprising merchants for the furtherance of Troy''s political
        and commercial interests, and for many years they were honored with public
        trusts which they never debased. The latter days of the eighteenth century
        were made a season of general sorrow and mourning to the American people by
        the sudden death of George Washington. The Revolutionary officers and sol
        diers resident in Troy who had been personally honored by the great commander,
        with weeping eyes and woeful hearts, gathered together, and in eulogy and
        commemorative words manifested their affection and loss of so good and great
        a man. At a meeting of the Trustees of the village, on the thirtieth of December,
        1799, it was resolved " That it be recommended to the inhabitants of this

        conference room lor evening meetings. In the year 1S17 a larger one was completed,
        and the association was greatly benefited by the ministrations of the Rev.
        Mr. Somers. Immersions were frequently performed in the river at the foot
        of Grand Division street. During this year, and for a number of years after
        the close of the Avar, all kinds of business and manufacturing interests were
        prostrat ed, and many persons were in consequence unemployed. The papers were
        filled with dissertations on political economy; the peo ple were admonished
        that riches come by saving and poverty by spending; the merchants were told
        not to buy more than they could sell, and the manufacturers were informed
        that the safest course for them was to suit their supplies to the regular
        laws of demand. The river during the three winters of these years of business
        depression and suffering, was singularly filled with a little scaleless fish,
        called "Tom Cod." This abundance of fish was considered a special gift of
        Providence, furnishing as it did, the tables of the great multitude with palatable
        and precious food. They have not in later years ap peared in any abundance
        in the Hudson in the vicinity of Troy. From the year 181 7 to 1820, the Troy
        Library contained from six hundred and thirty-seven to six hundred and ninety-two
        volumes. Jacob L. Lane was then librarian, and the books were kept in his
        office, where William H. Young''s book store is at present situated. Although
        business generally was everywhere dull and unprofitable, yet the shipping
        interests of Troy were apparently in a flourishing condition. On Sunday, April
        6th, of this year, between thirty and forty sloops arrived at the docks from
        New York, Athens and other places along the river. And in the following week,
        flour, wheat and provisions were shipped from Troy, amounting in value to
        two hun dred thousand dollars. The flour was the manufacture of the four mills
        in the southern part of the city. One of the greatest blessings ever conferred
        by the Legislature of New York, was the grand enactment which abolished slavery
        within the borders of the State By the act passed March 29, 1799, it was declared
        that every child born of a slave within the State, after the fourth of July,
        1799, should be free, but was to remain with the owner, mother, executors,
        and assigns, until the age of twenty eight years if a male, and if a female,
        until twenty-five years of age; and that every child born of a slave after
        the passage of the act, was 15', 1]

        \ xxx. 23, in Proverbs vii. 7, and in the Canticles iv. 14. The terms used\
        \ in the Talmud for cinnamon and cassia, \" khenoh \" and \" kiddah,\" both\
        \ seem to be derived from the pipe-like form ofthe spice. The Arabians informed\
        \ Herodotus1 that they obtained cin namon in marshes guarded by winged serpents,\
        \ and in the nests of birds. He says the birds made then nests of cinnamon\
        \ sticks fastened together with mud, and that the Arabians did not know where\
        \ the sticks came from. It is supposed, with great probability, that the Arabians\
        \ invented these fables in order to prevent travellers and others from finding\
        \ out where they obtained the spice, and thus spoil their trade. Pliny dismisses\
        \ the story of Herodotus and gives one of his own : according to him cinnamon\
        \ did not grow in Arabia, but came from Ethiopia, the bark being brought with\
        \ great difficulty across the sea by vessels sailing about the time of the\
        \ equinoxes, when a S.E. wind blew. It was never gathered without the permission\
        \ of a god, supposed to be Jupiter. The Ethiopians sacrificed forty-four oxen\

        \ before sunrise.\" (xii. 42.) Eratosthenes, librarian of Alexandria (b.c.\
        \ 194), Hippar chus, and Ptolemy place the cinnamon region in the north eastern\
        \ corner of Africa or Cape Guardafui. Strabo draws a fanciful parallel to\
        \ indicate the \"Regio cinnamomifer\xE6,\" or countries where the spice was\
        \ supposed to grow, passing on one side a little to the south of Taprobane,\

        \ of a deficiency of school accommodation the town ship was called upon to\
        \ elect a School Board, and the election took place in December, 1874. The\
        \ members are Mr. A. Ambler (chair man), Rev. J. Ellis, Rev. H. Baldwin, Mr.\
        \ AV. Wigglesworth, and Mr. T. Berry. The new board are building a school\

        \ most flourishing Mechanics' Institutes to be found irf any village in York-\
        \ shire, both as regarded the number of members and the direct manner in which\
        \ its usefulness was applied to the class for which it was specially designed.\
        \ It was established in 1826, having had for its founders a few working men\
        \ who met round a comb-pot at Lingbob, and for the first eight years its operations\
        \ were conducted solely by working people. The members having increased to\
        \ 130, it was decided to erect a building, costing \xA3780, but from the limited\
        \ means of the promoters, a debt of about half that amount for some time remained.\
        \ This building was opened in 1837. There was then a capital library of books,\
        \ and at intervals some of the most eminent lecturers of the country found\
        \ their way to Wilsden under the auspices of the institute. The institute\
        \ has passed through various periods of depres- sion, at times so intense\
        \ as almost to imperil its existence. In this respect, however, it has only\
        \ shared the fate of many another institu- tion having a like object. Twenty\
        \ years ago it had a membership of 200. Then this number fell considerably,\
        \ notwithstanding that the institution had a library equalled by few village\
        \ institutes, num- bering 3000 volumes. The present number of volumes is 3700,\
        \ and there is besides a small museum. Mr. Chris. Petty has been librarian\
        \ for many years. The institute has now ninety members, fifty of whom attend\
        \ classes under Government inspection. There is a penny savings bank held\
        \ in connection with the Yorkshire Penny Bank, in which there is an amount\
        \ to the credit of depositors of about ,\xA32000. This is one of the largest\
        \ banking accounts in connection with the Penny Bank, and it is a proof of\
        \ the people's thrift. Mr. W. Abbott is the actuary. The Co-operative Society\
        \ is another village institution originated by working men, who are now reaping\
        \ substantial benefits therefrom.", 1]

        across the Lake of Geneva in an open boat. After some search, he discovered
        the boatman who had taken them, opened his heart with generous wine, and induced
        him to confess that he had landed at Evian, in Savoy, two gentlemen, one of
        whom was never sober, which appeared much to vex the other. Where did these
        gentlemen go then ? Alas, he could not tell. They had bidden him observe that
        they were armed with pistols and knives, and so he turned away his head. "
        Mon Dieu ! what would you have ? I am father of a family." Here the clue failed.
        Evidently the man spoke the truth. From Evian roads branched off in all directions.
        Instead of being gifted, Briarius-like, with a hundred arms, Mr. Mowick would
        require a hundred pairs of legs to cover all those roads. It galled him to
        the quick to think that Trestleton should outwit him so simply. He would go
        to Geneva, where Madame Patibon (a Parisienne who let rooms in her Swiss villa
        to pay, as she elegantly termed it, for her gloves and pins) was exceedingly
        well known. Some said she lived only for appearances, in order to hoodwink
        some wealthy milord into espousing her pretty daughter. Be that as it might,
        she was no doubt a dupe of Trestleton''s, or she would never have been so
        plausible in his behalf. He would go to Geneva, inquire into her habits, and
        thus possibly pick up the broken thread. Day after day he chafed about the
        quays of that lovely town, hating the water, loathing the mountains, gathering
        no straw for the making of his bricks. Having occasion one day to purchase
        a book at the English library, his eye lighted on an envelope upon the desk
        addressed to Mr. Hodding, Hotel Feder, Genoa, in the well-known hand of Trestleton.
        " Who is Mon sieur Hodding ? " he inquired casually. The librarian, smiling
        at his curiosity, replied that Mr. Hodding''s', 1]

        they departed by the train especially prepared, over the Northern Central
        Road, and passing unmolested through Baltimore, arrived at the Capital in
        due time. That a well-matured plan had been formed to take Mr. Lincoln''s
        life, there was little doubt, and subsequent events con firm the belief. Mr.
        Raymond, in his Life of Lincoln, states that a notorious gambler, by the name
        of Byrne, left Baltimore soon after these events, and Avent to Richmond, where
        he fell under suspicion of disloyalty to the Southern Government, and was
        arrested. But at the hearing of his case, ex-United States Sena tor Wigfall
        testified that Byrne "was captain of a gang Avho were to kill Mr. Lincoln,"
        which secured his instant release, it being sufficient evidence of his loyalty
        to a Government Avhich could regard with favor, and lend its sanction to,
        such murderous practices. The headquarters of the assassins was at No. 66
        Fayette street, near Calvert, in the Taylor Building, which was the place
        of meeting of the leaders of the mob, who did actually murder some of the
        Massachusetts troops shortly afterward. One of the agents employed to trace
        out the parties to this con spiracy was under the direction of Samuel M. Felton,
        of Phila delphia, President of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore
        Railroad Company. Having his own road to protect, the bridges of which were
        threatened with destruction, he was able the more easily to extend his investigation
        beyond his immediate charge, and to trace the source of the danger. At the
        request of the Librarian of Harvard University, Mr. Felton, whose brother
        was the President of that institution, prepared an account of the investigations
        that he instituted. It illustrates, in a most striking manner, this noted
        night journey of Mr. Lincoln through Penn sylvania, and the solicitude felt
        by its citizens for his safety ; it serves, too, to show the diabolical nature
        of the rebellious spirit, even at that early stage. " It came to my knowledge,"
        says Mr. Felton, " in the early part of 1861, first by rumors and then from
        evidence which I could not doubt, that there was a deep laid conspiracy to
        capture Washington, destroy all the avenues leading to it from the North,
        East, and West, and thus prevent the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln in the Capital
        of the country ; and, if this plot did not succeed,', 1]

        \ This includes not only books and pamphlets, but maps, prints, articles in\
        \ periodicals, etc., and the aggregate gives no clew to the proportions of\
        \ each.\" Now, if the number given for 1872 be correct, the increase, instead\
        \ of being \" about ten per cent.,\" is 38.53 per cent. As the report of the\
        \ Librarian of Congress for 1874 gives the number of copyright entries during\
        \ the year end ing December 1, 1874, as 16,283, \" being an increase over\
        \ the entries of the preceding year of 931,\" the correctness of the total\
        \ for 1873 (15,352) is proved, so that either the total given for 1872 or\
        \ the per centage reck oned by the writer in the Annual Cyclopedia is wrong.\
        \ As the entry of all prints and labels intended for use in connection with\
        \ any article of man ufacture was transferred (Aug. 1, 1874) from the office\
        \ of the Librarian of Congress to that of the Commissioner of Patents, the\
        \ increase in the copyright business is really greater than is indicated by\
        \ the figures given above. The previous reports included \"several thousand\
        \ entries annually of mere labels which never had any appropriate relation\

        prior to 1725. The present stone edifice was erected in or about the year
        1740, on the site of the original log church. Here the pious Pastor Elder
        preached with his rifle by his side, and served as Colonel of the provin cial-forces
        in the French and Indian wars. Here rest the re mains of Elder, John Harris,
        Jun., founder of Harrisburg, William Maclay, Gen. Simpson, Gen. Crouch, heroes
        of the revolution, the M''Clures, the Forsters, the Gilmores, the Grays, the
        Mills, the Rutherford''s, the Espys, and many others prominent in our early
        history. THE HARRISBURG CITY GRAYS. This company was originally organized
        in 1861, as the "First City Zouaves," by Captain DeB. Eandolf Keim. It served
        with great credit during the war as Company A, One', 1]

    - ['15 On the 26th of June, 1S63, a few days prior to the bal Gettysburg, when
        it was thought that a rebel army was likely to reach Harrisburg, the entire
        Library was.conveycd by cars to. Philadelphia, finding security, where in
        1777 it was removed in order to be secure from the British. Many of these
        origi nal volumes still occupy honorable positions on the shelves. After the
        adoption of the first Constitution iu 1790, the Sen ate and the Ilouse, each
        for themselves, assumed to main tain a Library, by which''system there were
        thrde Libraries. But in 1816 they were consolidated and- placed under one
        Li brarian chosen annually. In 1829 the first catalogue was printed, when
        -there were only 4,838 volumes accounted for. The second catalogue was printed
        in 1845, when there were 11,577 volumes. In 1854 there were said to be 13,000
        vol umes. The Library was at this time placed under a Librarian, to be appointed
        by the Governor, for a term of three years. In 1859 there wert 21,923 volumes,
        and in 1872, by an actual count by the Librarian, there were 27,629 volumes.
        The Li brary is now conducted by the Librarian and an Assistant, and contains
        about 32,000 volumes. It is a reference library ex clusivelj'', free to all,
        but no books are by law permitted to be issued save Only to State officials
        or members of the Legisla ture in their official capacity. Visitors are fully
        accorded the privilege of viewing thp Library throughout. It is maintained
        by direct appropriations from the .State Treasury, and the books are all purchased
        by the Librarian^ except sach as are obtained by exchange or that may be presented
        by friends or authors. Leaving this department, we ascend to the main hall,
        ofthe second floor by a short flight- of stairs, where the vestibule has a
        circular opening, with a railing surrounding it, through which may be seen
        the openings of the several stories to the ceiling, and through that to the
        interior of the dome with its vaulted roof. A capacious hall leads from this
        vestibule to both ends of the building ; communicating with the several department
        offices, etc. The first room on the left is the private room of the Lieutenant
        Governor, directly opposite is the Insurance Department, farther on is the
        Adjutant General''s Department ami the Flag room. This latter is a most interesting
        resort and should be visited.', 4]

        only prevented the earlier building of a Capitol, but the accumulation of
        an adequate library. Some of the earlier purchases of books were very judicious
        and valuable, but neither space nor means existed for placing the library
        in proper condition. Since it has become certain that books if purchased will
        be preserved and made accessible, a great change has taken place, and the
        present collection is already assuming importance. By a careful system of
        exchanges, the Law Library has become very complete in American Reports, and
        fairly supplied with other English and American publications, and is constantly
        improving. The General Library is also advancing rapidly. Gover nor Baldwin
        while in office ventured upon what was then the untried experiment, of appointing
        a lady, Mrs. Harriet A. Tenney, to be State Libra rian. Her nomination was
        cheerfully ratified, and the choice has been abundantly justified by the result.
        The neatness and care with which the library room and its contents have been
        arranged and kept, and the quiet and decorum prevailing, are in themselves
        a great advantage, not always sound in State libraries. The Librarian has
        shown a thorough knowledge of books and their selec tion, and an enthusiastic
        desire to make her charo-e a literary treasury. A department of American antiquities,
        and valuable relics has also been planned, and some collections already made
        of documents, pictures, and other things of historical', 1]

        I came to quite sympathize with the skele ton ; and in the librarian I found
        a man of the same way of thinking as myself. I must describe him. He was nicknamed
        the "Tame Elephant." His build was ex traordinarily short, stout, and square
        ; his muscular strength, as those who had seen him throw the hammer or put
        the weight knew, was enormous. But with this Atlas like frame was found a
        very amiable and docile character. To this union of qualities he owed his
        sobriquet. His habits were unpleasant, for he did not love his tub, and was
        for ever changing his religion. He inclines to Buddhism now, I believe, after
        running the whole round of creeds. He was at the time of which I am writing
        a great walker, a great tippler of beer, and a very great smoker. If you were

        down ; if you were startled by somebody bursting through a hedge, or fell

        If a light was burning at three in the morn ing in a room adjoining the library,
        it was the Elephant still at his studies. And his reading was of two sorts.
        He devoured fiction in English, in German, in French : his memory was prodigious,
        and he could spout forth pages of Scott or Goethe or Rabelais without a verbal
        mistake. But this was his recreation. His work was poring over the pages of
        every book on the Super natural he could lay his large dirty hands on. His
        knowledge of the University books had obtained for him the post of librarian,
        to which a scholarship of some sixty or seventy pounds a year was attached.
        A common purpose made us friends. He had determined to penetrate the mystery

    - ["PREFACE. The object of this publication is to present in brief outline the\
        \ position, resources, industries, institutional character, and other general\
        \ features of the State of Michigan, embracing so much of its history as may\
        \ serve to introduce it to the reader, for the information of persona aal,,,\
        \ may be looking for places for settlement or investment. The project of the\
        \ work bad its ,,r,3.'in with the State Centennial Board of Managers, but\
        \ being 90 directly in the interest of eini. gration, it seemed to come legitimately\
        \ within the power conferred upon the Governor in thai regard, and it has\
        \ been done under his authority. The work wns one for which there aa.i- no\
        \ precedent, and the style and method of which could not exist clearly at\
        \ first in the mind of the compiler, but had to be wrought out, and in a measure\
        \ created. Sources of information had 1,, be sought out, and much labor was\
        \ necessarily alone bes,,re any visible results were produced, ami in some\
        \ cases w,,rk over which mucb lime had been spenl bad to undergo remodeling\
        \ to aalapt it to the developing character of the work as a whole. The compiler\
        \ fell much embar rassment in having to deal with so great a variety of topics;\
        \ s,,r, although nol unfamiliar with the L'.-neral interests of the State,\
        \ there are few men, however well informed, who will deem themselves sufficiently\
        \ conversant with all of its great interests, to feel 1 petenl to do |ustice\
        \ t,, them all in a work of this character. Such a work would be in no danger\
        \ of being too well done, if entrusted to a bureau instead of to a single\
        \ person. The size of the work as a whole, and the space 1 1 1 :\u2022 t shonld\
        \ be given to particular topics, were problems requiring more than a single\
        \ thought for their solution. If the aa.ok were ma, lo voluminous, but few\
        \ persons would give it any attention; while, on the other band, a small work,\
        \ purporting to represent the varied interests of a greal State, might for\
        \ other reasons fail of its object. A large volume might be made up from ran,\
        \ loin statistics, with comparative!] little labor; but next to facts themselves,\
        \ their chief value as .1 means of diffusing informati consists in their grouping\
        \ and arrangement. The time and thought bestowed upon this work have been\
        \ employed largely in this, as well us in inquiry and investigation :as to\
        \ sources of informa tion, and in the preparation anal arrangement of such\
        \ information when found. Th,' -tate department reports were readily accessible,\
        \ and haae been made ii-o of u far as practicable, and ;all persons connea-t,-,l\
        \ \\\\ it h the departments ;it Lansing, anal the State Librarian, have cheerfully\
        \ aided in all possible ways. Waiting's Atlas of Michigan has I a liberall)\
        \ quoted from, especially as to the geography, topography, and meteorology\
        \ of the st;ite. The report of the State census and statistics of 1874 has\
        \ been lndispenaable, but Its data in man] respects, it is feared, does great\
        \ injustice, on account of incompleteness, to the material interests and resources\
        \ of the State. This is believed to i,e especially the <-;im- as regards manufacturing\
        \ industries, in which connection reference is made to b e further remarks\
        \ on page eighty. Upon commencing the work, circulars anal letters were addressed\
        \ to man] persons represenl ing public institutions anal spc,-i;il inta-rests,\
        \ asking written sta! ints in a form to I, a- embodied in the work. A few-\
        \ only responded, and the rcs( -<\u2022- of some <>f these, although oomplying\
        \ in a most gratifying manner with tin- req is which called them out, ar<\
        \ itted, for ilia* ra-;is,,n that oilu-r similar interests are naat equally\
        \ represented, and to make use of them would seem partial, and would break\
        \ the uniformity of the work. In other cases, matter furnished in res] se\
        \ to these requests has been used with more or Less modification. The compiler\
        \ has, h,,aa ever, been unaler the necessity of summarizing many imp,, riant\
        \ interests himself, where he ha 3. hoped for more detaileal statements from\
        \ those familiar with them. That entire accuracy has been attained, is not\
        \ by any means presumed. As to the Upper Peninsula, the compiler has felt\
        \ throughout mui-h embarrassment, owing to a want of personal knowledge, and\
        \ the alisllculty of communicating reailily with that section during the winter\
        \ season. The matter relating to the [TppeT Peninsula interests has, hoavoa\
        \ a-r, been submitted 1,, gentlemen familiar with those interests, who have\
        \ maale some corrections, the more essential of Which are noteii at the end\
        \ of the work. A just and fair criticism of the work as a whole is desired\
        \ and invited; for by such means, errors and inaccuracies may be corrected\u2014\

        \ Walter Raleigh. A copy of the first edition (of extreme rarity) is in the\
        \ British Museum ; and it proved of great use to Mr. Aiton in preparing his\
        \ Hortus LKewensis, by enabling him to ascertain the time when many old plants\
        \ were first cultivated. Gerarde dated the first edition of his Herbal from\
        \ Holborn. Wood calls him \" the best herbalist of his time.\" Among the Lansdowne\
        \ MSS. in the British Museum, is a letter of Gerarde's own drawing-up, for\
        \ Lord Burghley to re commend to the University of Cambridge the establishment\
        \ of a physic-garden there, to encourage the \" facultie of simpling.\" Several\
        \ London localities of Gerarde's sim pling may be gathered from his Herbal.\
        \ Thus, he says : \" Of water violets I have not found any such plenty in\
        \ any one place as in the water ditches adjoining to Saint George his fielde,\
        \ near London.\" He describes Mile End, Whitechapel, as \" the common near\
        \ London where penny-royal grows in great abundance.\" \" The small wild buglosse\
        \ grows upon the drie ditch bank about Pickadilla ;\" and he found \" white\
        \ saxifrage, burr-reedes, <Sic.,\" in the ditch, right against the place of\
        \ execution, St. Thomas-a- Waterings, now the Old Kent-road. Baldwin's Gardens,\
        \ between Leather-lane and Gray's-inn-lane, were, according to a stone upon\
        \ a corner-house bearing the arms of Queen Elizabeth, named after Richard\
        \ Baldwin, one of the royal gardeners, who began building here in 1589. Montague\
        \ House, Bloomsbury, had its spacious gardens, \" after the French manner\
        \ ;\" and the gardens of the houses in Great Russell-street were noted for\
        \ their fragrance. Strype (1720) describes the north side as having gardens\
        \ behind tbe houses, with tbe prospect of pleasant fields up to Hampstead\
        \ and Highgate, \" inasmuch as this place is esteemed the most healthful in\
        \ London.\" The garden of the Earl of Lincoln was highly kept, long before\
        \ the mansion became an Inn of Court. The Earl's bailiff's accounts (24 Edward\
        \ I.) show it to have pro duced apples, pears, large nuts, and cherries sufficient\
        \ for the Earl's table, and to yield by sale in one year 135?., modern currency.\
        \ The vegetables grown were beans, onions, garlick, leeks ; hemp was grown\
        \ ; the cuttings of the vines much prized ; of pear-trees there were several\
        \ varieties; the only flowers named are roses. (T. Hudson Turner.) The \"\

        \ of Isaac Bickerstaff. In 1 and 2 Philip and Mary, the walk under the trees\

        \ the said garden was enlarged, and a terrace-walk made on the left side ;\

    - ['CURIOSITIES OF LONDON. 564 Bowling-greens were also among the celebrities
        of Marylebone ; where, says the grave John Locke (Diary, 1679), a curious
        stranger " may see several persons of quality bowling, two or three times
        a week, all the summer." The bowling-green of the Rose Tavern and gaming-house
        in High-street is referred to in Lady Mary Wortley Montague''s memorable line
        (see p. 8) ; and it is one of the scenes of Capt. Macheath''s debaucheries,
        in Gay''s Beggars'' Opera. This and an adjoining bowling-green were incorporated
        in Marylebone Gardens, open gratis to all classes ; but the company be coming
        more select, one shilling entrance-money was charged, an equivalent being
        allowed in viands. Here were given balls and concerts ; Handel''s music was
        played, under Dr. Ame''s direction, followed by fireworks, and in 1772, a
        model picture of Mount Etna in eruption. Burlettas after Shakspeare were recited
        in the theatre here in 1774; and in 1776 was exhibited a representation of
        the Boulevards at Paris, Egyptian Pyramids, &c. : the gardens were suppressed
        in 1777-8, and the site built upon. A deed of assignment made by Thomas Lowe,
        the singer, conveying his property in Marylebone Gardens, to trustees, for
        the benefit of his creditors, in 1769, was in the possession of the late Mr.
        Samp son Hodgkinson, who was familiar with the parochial history of Marylebone.
        From this deed we learn that the premises of Rysbraeek, the statuary, were
        formerly part of the Great (Marylebone) Garden. (See Smith''s sSi''. Marylebone,
        1833.) The orchestra of the Gardens stood upon the site of No. 17, Devonshire-place,
        nearly opposite the old ehurch described at page 183. Chatterton wrote a burletta,
        entitled The Eevenge, to be performed at Marylebone Gardens ; and that fortunate
        collector, Mr. Upcott, then librarian of the London Institution, found upon
        the counter of a cheesemonger''s shop in the City, the above drama, in the
        handwriting of Chatterton, with his receipt given to Henslow, the proprietor
        of the Gardens, for the copy-money paid for the piece. It was pub lished by
        Tom King, the bookseller and book-auctioneer; but its authenticity was doubted.
        Prize-fighting was a pastime of this period, and Marylebone a place at which
        " to learn valour " (Beggars'' Opera). Here was the boarded house of Figg,
        " the Atlas of the Sword," whose portrait is in the second plate of Hogarth''s
        Rake''s Progress. Near Figg''s was Broughton''s Amphitheatre, often crowded
        with amateurs of high rank. In the Evening Post, March 16, 1715 we find :
        " On Wednesday last, four gentlemen were robbed and stripped in the fields
        between London and Mary-le-bon." Between 1718 and 1729 was built the north
        side of Tyburn-road, now Oxford-street; and the squares and streets northward
        were then commenced : still, much of the ground between the new buildings
        and the village of Marylebone was pasture-fields ; and Maitland, in his History
        of London, 1739, states there to have been then only 577 houses in the parish,
        and 35 persons who kept coaches. In 1795 there were 6200 houses; in 1861,
        houses 16,370. In 1841 the Vestry of St. Marylebone accepted tenders from
        certain contractors to the amount of 4150''. for permission to cart away the
        ashes (breeze) from the several houses in this vast parish. Marylebone is
        a parliamentary borough, containing the three parishes of St. Maryle bone,
        Paddington, and St. Pancras. (See Churches, St. Marylebone, p. 183.) In the
        Parish Register is the following entry : " Georgiana Augusta Frederica Elliott,
        daughter of H.R.H. George, Prince of Wales, and Grace Elliott; born 30 March,
        and baptized 30 July, 1782." MAY FAIR, THE district north of Piccadilly, and
        between Park-lane and Berkeley-square, was J- originally Brookfield ; but
        received its present name from a fair being held there by grant of James IL,
        after the suppression of St. James''s Fair, to commence on May 1, and continue
        fifteen days ; where multitudes of the booths were " not for trade and merchandize,
        but for musick, showes, drinking, gaming, raffling, lotteries, stage plays,
        and drolls." It was frequented " by all the nobility in town ;" but was sup
        pressed in 1708, when the downfall of May Fair quite sunk the price of Pinkethman''s
        tame elephant, and sent his ingenious company of strollers to Greenwich. (See
        Tatler, Nos. 4 and 20). The Fair was, however, revived; and John Carter describes
        its "booths for jugglers; prize-fighters, both at cudgels and back-sword;
        boxing matches, and wild beasts. The sports not under cover were mountebanks,
        fire-eaters, ass-racing, sausage-tables, dice ditto, up-and-downs, merry-go-rounds,
        bull-baiting,', 1]
    - ['720 CURIOSITIES OF LONDON. side; and at Gresham College. About 1648-9, some
        of the members, including Dr. (afterwards Bishop) Wilkins, removed to Oxford,
        and were joined by Seth Smith, Ralph Bathurst, Sir William Petty, and the
        Hon. Robert Boyle, who met at Petty''s lodgings in an apothecary''s house,
        " because of the convenience of inspecting drugs." The members in London continued
        also to meet, until, in 1658, they were ejected from Gresham College, which
        was required for barracks. Evelyn, Cowley, and Sir William Petty proposed
        separate plans for a " philosophical college :" Sprat says that Cowley''s
        proposition accelerated the foundation of the Royal Society, in praise of
        which he sub sequently wrote an ode. At the Restoration, in 1660, the meetings
        were revived ; and April 22, 1662, the Society was incorporated by royal charter,
        by Charles II. This charter is on four sheets of vellum, and has on the first
        sheet ornamental initials and flowers, and a finely executed portrait of Charles
        in Indian ink; appended is the Great Seal in green wax. The Charter empowers
        the President to wear his hat while in the chair, and the fellows addressed
        the President bareheaded till he made a sign for them to put on their hats
        ; customs now obsolete. Next year the King granted a second charter, which
        is of greater importance than the first ; and his Majesty presented the Society
        with the silver-gilt mace. The Mace is about 4 feet in length, and weighs
        190 oz. avoirdupois: its stem is chased with the thistle, and has an urn-shaped
        head, surmounted by a crown, ball, and cross. Upon the head are embossed figures
        of a rose, harp, thistle, and fleur-de-lis, and the initials C.R. four times
        repeated. Under the crown are chased the royal arms ; and at the other extremity
        of the stem are two shields, one bearing the Society''s arms, the other a
        Latin inscription denoting the niace to have been presented to the Society
        by Charles II. in 1663. It was long believed by numberless visitors to be
        the " bauble" mace turned out of the House of Commons by Cromwell when he
        dissolved the Long Parliament ; but Mr. Weld, the assistant-secretary aud
        librarian, in a communication to the Society, April 30, 1846, proved this
        to be a popular error, by showing the warrant for making this mace and delivering
        it to Lord Brouncker, the first President of the Society. Again, the " bauble"
        was altogether different in form from the Society''s mace, and was nearly
        destitute of ornament, and without the crown and cross, as described in Whitelock''s
        Memorials, and represented accordingly in West''s picture of the Dissolu tion
        of the Long Parliament. From this session, 1663, date the Philosophical Transactions,
        wherein the proceed ings and discoveries of the Society are registered. This
        year the Society exercised their privilege of claiming the bodies of criminals
        executed at Tyburn, which were to be dissected in Gresham College. In 1664,
        the king signed himself in the charter-book as the founder; and his brother,
        the Duke of York, signed as a fellow. In 1667 Chelsea College was granted
        to the Society, for their meetings, laboratory, repository, and library ;
        but the building was too dilapidated, " the annoyance of Prince Rupert''s
        glass-house" adjoined it, and the property was purchased back for the king''s
        use for 1300/. The Society then resumed their meetings in Gresham College,
        until they were dispersed by the Great Plague and Fire, after which they met
        in Arundel House in the Strand. The Fellows now (1667) numbered 200, aud their
        subscription 1*. per week; from the payment of which Newton, who joined the
        Society in 1674, was excused, on account of his narrow finances. In 1674 the
        Society returned to Gresham College. They were fiercely attacked : a Warwick
        physician accused them of attempting to undermine the Universities, to bring
        in popery and absurd novelties ; but a severer satire was The Elephant in
        the Moon, by Butler. Among their early practices was the fellows gathering
        May-dew, and ex perimenting with the divining-rod; and the Hon. Robert Boyle
        believed in the efficacy of the touch of Greatrakes the Stroker for the evil.
        In 1686 Newton presented his Principia to the Society, whose clerk, Halley,
        the astronomer, printed the work. The MS., entirely in Newton''s hand, is
        preserved in the library. In 1703 Sir Isaac Newton was elected president.
        In 1710 the society purchased the house of Dr. Brown, at the top of Crane-court,
        Fleet-street, " being in the middle of the town and out of noise." This house
        was built by Wren, after the Great Fire of 1666, upon the site of the mansion
        of Dr. Nicholas Barbon. This new purchase was considered unfortunate for the
        society. The house required several hundred pounds'' repairs ; the rooms were
        small and inconvenient compared with those of Gresham Col lege ; and the removal
        led to the separation of the Society from the College Professors, after being
        associated for nearly fifty years. The house in Crane-court fronted a garden,
        where was a fishpond. There is a small hall on the ground floor, and a passage
        from the staircase iuto the garden, fronting which are the meeting-room, 25j
        feet by', 1]

        \ of Dido ; its ceiling with gods and goddesses ; and its grand saloon by\

        \ flight of steps, under an archway and porch, the latter built by Hardwick\
        \ in 1843. The windows are filled with glass, unusually fine : those on the\
        \ sides have figures of prophets and apostles, by Flemish artists ; the great\
        \ eastern and western windows have armorial embellishments. The carved oaken\
        \ seats are of the time of James I., but the pulpit is later. The Organ, by\
        \ Flight and Robson (1820), is of great power and sweetness of tone ; and\

        \ ; and with its bays and enriched windows, battle ments, gables, towers,\
        \ and clustered chimney- shafts, is very picturesque. The Gate-house, built\
        \ by Archbishop Morton about 1490, consists of an embattled centre and two\
        \ immense square towers, of fine red brick with stone dressings, and a spacious\
        \ Tudor arched gateway and postern. The towers are ascended by spiral stone\
        \ staircases, leading to the Record-room containing many of the archives of\
        \ the see of Canterbury. Adjoining the archway is a small prison-room, with\
        \ high and narrow windows, and thick stone walls to which are fastened three\
        \ strong iron rings ; and in the wall are cuttings, including \xA7lo{m Srafton,\

        \ in glazed bricks. At this gate the dole immemorially given to the poor by\
        \ the Archbishops of Canterbury is constantly distributed. It consists of\
        \ fifteen quartern loaves, nine stone of beef, and five shillings worth of\
        \ half pence, divided into three equal portions, and distributed every Sunday,\
        \ Tuesday, and Thursday, among thirty poor parishioners of Lambeth ; the beef\
        \ being made into broth and served iu pitchers. The Lollards' Tower, on the\
        \ left of tbe outer court, is embattled, and chiefly of dark-red brick, faced\
        \ with stone on its outer sides. It was built (1434-5) by Arch bishop Chicheley,\
        \ whose arms are sculptured on the outer wall on tbe Thames side; beneath\
        \ them is a Gothic niche, wherein formerly stood the image of St. Thomas h\

        \ of stone, with an oaken inner and outer door, each 3J inches thick, closely\
        \ studded with iron rivets and fastenings. This chamber is nearly 15 feet\

        \ to Broadwall ; and was bounded by the river on tlie north-west, and the\
        \ ancient way or road called Lam beth Marsh on the south-east. The names of\
        \ Narrow-wall and Broad-wall were derived from the embankments subsequently\
        \ made. In cutting for the railway and lines of sewerage at the great terminus\
        \ near York-road (a space in size eiiual to Grosvenor-square), there was found\
        \ a large deposit from the inundations of the Thames, con taining gravel-stoues\
        \ and dark wet clay, or pressed river-mud, imbeddiug fragments of twigs, bones,\
        \ pieces of Roman tile, &c. Narrow-wall, Vine-street, and Comwall-road are\
        \ delineated in views of these suburbs in Queen Elizabeth's reign : Vine-street\
        \ is from eight to ten feet below the level of the adjacent streets. In the\
        \ Marsh stood, until 1823, an old house, called Bonner's house, which was\
        \ traditionally known as the residence of Bishop Bonner. Near the Marsh resided\
        \ Thomas Bushell, a man of scientific attainments, who was a friend of Lord\
        \ Chancellor Bacon. He obtained from Charles 1. a grant to coin silver money\
        \ for the purposes of the king, when the use of his Mint at the Tower was\
        \ denied to the king. When Oliver Cromwell assumed the protectorate, Thomas\
        \ Bushell hid himself in this house, which it seems had a turret upon it.\
        \ A large garret extended tbe length of the premises \u25A0 in this the philosopher\
        \ lay hid for upwards of a year. This apart ment he had hung with black ;\
        \ at one end was a skeleton extended ou a mattress : at the other was a low\
        \ bed, on which he slept ; and on the dismal hangings of the wall were depicted\
        \ several emblems of mortality. At the Restoration, Charles II. supported\
        \ Bushell in some of his speculations. He died in 1674, eighty years of age,\
        \ and was buried in the little cloisters of Westminster Abbey. At South Lambeth,\
        \ upon the site of Sir Noel Caron's mansion and deer-park, are Beaufoy's Vinegar\
        \ and Wine Works. Here were a vessel of sweet wine containing 59,109 gallons,\
        \ and another of vinegar of 56,799 gallons; the lesser of which exceeded the\
        \ famous Heidelberg tun by 40 barrels. Mr. Beaufoy, F.R.S., was an eminent\
        \ mathematician, and a munificent patron of education; his bust is placed\
        \ in the Council Chamber, Gnildhall. In Lambeth Walk, close upon the South-Western\
        \ Rail way, are the Lambeth Ragged Schools, founded in 1851 by Mr. Beaufoy,\
        \ at the expense of 10,000?., and 4000?. endowment, as a memorial of the benevolent\
        \ Mrs. Beaufoy, the wife of the founder. On part of the site of Belvedere\
        \ House and Gardens were established, in 1785, the Lambeth Water-works, first\
        \ taking their water from the borders of the Thames, then from its centre,\
        \ near Hungerford Bridge, by a cast-iron conduit-pipe 42 inches in diameter\
        \ ; whence, in 1852, the works were removed to Seething Wells, Ditton, 23\
        \ miles by the river-course from London Bridge. Thence the water is supplied\
        \ to the Company's reservoirs at Brixton, 10s miles, by steam pumping-engines,\
        \ at the rate of 10,000,000 gallons daily ; from these reservoirs, 100 feet\

        \ -gateway to the inner court was built, with a fireproof room over it, in\
        \ which are kept the MSS. The library has a large north-west bay-window of\
        \ richly ornamented stained and painted glass ; in the top division is a very\
        \ large coat of the arms of the see and Archbishop Juxon ; and underneath\
        \ are tlie arms of the see and Archbishop Howley, 1829. Around are smaller\
        \ coats of the arms of about twenty-four archbishops, each impaled with the\
        \ arms ofthe see. Here are also the arms of Philip II. King of Spain ; but\
        \ the most curious piece of painted glass is an ancient portrait of Archbishop\
        \ Chicheley. The roof is of oak, and a fine specimen of olden carpentry :\
        \ it consists of eight main ribs, with longitudinal braces, springing from\
        \ corbel brackets, and enriched with carved spandrels, pendants, enwreathed\
        \ mitres, and the arms of Juxon and the see of Canterbury several times repeated.\
        \ Above the two fireplaces are painted the arms of the see, impaling those\
        \ of Bancroft, the founder of tlie library ; and of Seeker, a liberal contributor.\
        \ The books, over-estimated by Ducarel at 25,000 volumes, are kept in wall\
        \ and projecting oak cases ; the earliest printed works being in the south-west\
        \ bay-window recess. Until Bancroft bequeathed his books in 1610, each archbishop\
        \ brought his own private collection. Bancroft's hooks remained at Lambeth\
        \ till 1646, two years after the execution of Laud, when being seized by the\
        \ Parliament, the use of them was granted to Dr. Wiucocke. They were subsequently\
        \ given to Sion College, and many began to get into private hands ; when Selden\
        \ suggested to the University of Cambridge a right to them, and they were\
        \ delivered, pursuant to an ordinance of Parliament, dated Feb. 1617, into\
        \ their possession. After the Restoration, and re peated demands hy Juxon\
        \ and Sheldon, the books were collected, including those in private hands,\
        \ and in the possession of John Thurloe and Hugh Peters. Evelyn writes to\
        \ Pepys, in 1689, that the library was then \"replenished with excellent books,\
        \ but that it ebbs and flows, like the Thames running by it, at every prelate's\
        \ accession or translation.\" The books left by Archbishops Bancroft, Abbot,\
        \ Laud, Sheldon, and Tenison, bear their arms. There is only one volume in\
        \ the collection known to have be longed to Archbishop Parker, which is a\
        \ volume of Calvin's writing : his arms are on the outside, and within is\
        \ written in red lead, \" J. Parker,\" who was the archbishop's son. The first\
        \ complete Catalogue made of the printed booke was drawn up by Bishop Gibson\
        \ when librarian. In 1718 it was fairly copied by Dr. Wilkins, in three volumes\
        \ folio; and it has been continued by his successors to the present time.\
        \ The library consists of rare and curious editions of the Scriptures, commentaries\
        \ ofthe early father?, scarce controversial divinity, records of ecclesiastical\
        \ affairs, English history and topography ; many fine copies, splendidly embellished.\
        \ The early printed books (see the Eev. Dr. Maitland'6two Catalogues) include,\
        \ Caxton's Chronicles of England and Description of Britain, both \"fynsshed\"\
        \ in 1480, the finest copies extant; Lyndwode's Constifutiones Provinciates,\

        \ 1500, intituled, La Dance Macabre (the Dance of Death), printed with old\
        \ Gothic types and beautifully illuminated. Here, also, in volumes, is Bancroft's\
        \ collection of black-letter tracts, pamphlets, and sermons ; remarkable for\
        \ St. Paul's Cross sermons, Mar-Prelate tracts, and the writings of the Brownists\
        \ and other Elizabethan separatists. Here, too, is a copy of Archbishop Parker's\
        \ Antiquities printed, by Dayes in 1572 (only two complete copies extant)\
        \ : it contains the very rare portrait of Parker, taken just before his death,\
        \ by Berg. Among the Manuscripts are, the ancient French version and exposition\
        \ ofthe Apocalypse, with miniature paintings, No. 75; the Latin copy of the\
        \ Apocalypse, No. 209 (thirteenth century), with 78 brilliant illuminations;\

        \ Salisbury missal, folio, on vellum, emblazoned with Archbishop Chichelcy's\
        \ arms. The MSS. of Greek and Latin classics are extremely valuable. Here\

        \ place, we find, in this library, the record of 14,359 patents : of these\
        \ the payment for extension to fourteen years only seems to apply to 7529.\
        \ Since the new law has made patents more easy of obtainment, the specifications\
        \ were more numerous than those which in the Chaff wax days were recorded\
        \ during more than two centuries. On an average about 3000 petitions for provisional\

        \ the additional stamp duty required at the end of the seventh year. Among\
        \ the printed records, we see the dawnings of steam-power, the electric tele\

        diamond-hilted sword besides cuirasses, helmets, and other trophies, captured
        by the soldier-Marquis in tho Peninsular War. Hope House (Mrs. Hope), south-east
        comer of Down-street, Piccadilly, was built in 1849, for the late H. T. Hope,
        Esq., under the joint superintendence of M. Dusillion, a French artist, and
        Professor Donaldson. The fronts are Caen s''one, and have panels of decorative
        marbles in the piers between the windows ; the arrangement of which is novel,
        especially in the attic-story. The total height from the street-level to the
        balus trade (surmounted with superbly-carved vases) is 62 feet. The entrance-porch
        in Down-street is very rich ; in the principal window-pediments are sculptured
        the armo rial bearings of Mr. Hope, repeated with the initial H in the very
        handsome iron railing, cast by Andre in Paris. The details throughout show
        very careful and elegant draw ing ; and the carving, wholly by French artists,
        is beautifully executed. The grand staircase and hall occupy the centre of
        the building ; the upper hall is paved with coloured marbles in patterns.
        The walls are plaster-of-Paris polished, scagliola panels, and marble plinths
        ; the floors, fire-proof, are of cast-iron girders and tile arches. The ceilings
        are panelled and enriched ; the principal doors are of oak, carved with the
        initial H in shields ; some of the chimney-pieces are of pierre-de-tonnerre,
        panelled with French marbles ; others are of bronzed metal, with caryatid
        figures. The stables (for 12 horses) and coach-houses are in the rear of the
        mansion. W. Cubitt and Co., builders ; ornamental work (wainscot doors, ceilings,
        stone carvings, mahogany case ments) by French artists ; cost about 30,000/.
        There are few pictures here, the col lections having been removed to Deepdene,
        in Surrey. Among the antiques is Sir William Hamilton''s second collection,
        made at Naples. The mansion may be seen by cards o''lt tinable by introduction
        to the owner. The collection was formed at the celebrated mansion in Duchess-street,
        Portland-place, in the deco ration of which Mr. Hope, the author of Anastasius,
        exemplified the classic principles illustrated in his large work on Household
        Furniture and Internal Decorations, 1805. Thus the suite of apartments included
        the Egyptian or Black Room, with ornaments from scrolls of papyrus and mummy-cases;
        the furniture and ornaments were pale yellow and bluish-green, relieved by
        masses of black and gold. The Blue or Indian Room, in costlv Oriental style.
        The S/ar Room : emblems of Night below : and above, Aurora visiting Cephalus
        on Mount Ida, by Flaxman ; furniture, wreathed figures of the Hours. The Closet
        or Boudoir, hung with tent-like drapery; the mantel-piece an Egyptian portico;
        Egyptian, Hindoo, and Chinese idols and curiosities. Picture Gallery: Ionic
        columns, entablature, and pediment from the Temple of Erectheus at Athens;
        car of Apollo, classic tables, pedestals, &c. In four separate apartments
        were arranged 200 Greek vases, including two copies of the Barberini or Portland
        Vase ; the furniture partly from Pompcian models. The New Gallery, for 100
        pictures of the Flemish school, antique bronzes and vases ; furniture of elegant
        Grecian design. Mr. Hope died at Duchess-street in 1831 : he will ever be
        remembered for his taste and munificence as the early patron of Chantrey,
        Flax man, Canova, and Thorwaldsen. Lansdowne House (Marquis of Lansdowne),
        which, with its garden, occupies the south side of Berkeley-square, was commenced
        by Robert Adam for the Marquis of Bute, but was sold unfinished to Lord Shelburne,
        created Marquis of Lansdowne in 1784. The purchase-money was 22,000/., but
        the mansion cost Lord Bute 25,000/. The Marquis, in 1804, acknowledged the
        possession of the secret of the authorship of Junius''s Letters, which he
        promised to publish ; but his lordship died in the following week. The " Letters"
        are believed by some to have been the joint production of Lord Shelburne,
        Colonel Barrel and Dunning, Lord Ash burton ; and their three portraits, painted
        in one picture by Sir Joshua Reyn ilds, in 1781-5, have been regarded as evidence
        of the joint authorship. Possibly, therefore, Junius''s Letters were written
        in Lansdowne, then Shelburne, House. It is better established, that oxygen
        was discovered here, Aug. 1, 1774, by Dr. Priestley, then librarian to Lord
        Shelburne. The reception-room contains a fine collection of sculpture, including
        about fifty statues, as many busts, besides bassi relievi : it was commenced
        by Gavin Hamilton, who first excavated the site of Adrian''s Villa. At the
        foot of the staircase is a noble statue of Diana launching an arrow ; in the
        great dining-room are nine antique statues in niches, including Germanicus,
        Claudius, Trajan, aud Cicero; also the Sleeping Nymph, the last work of Canova
        ; in the front drawing-room his Venus quitting the Bath; and a statue by Rauch,
        of Berlin, of a Child holding an alms-dish. In the gallery, 100 feet in length,
        at the east end are life-size statues of Hercules, Marcus Aurelius, Mercury,
        Diomede, Theseus, Juno, an Amazon, Juno standing, Hercules when a youth, Jason,
        &c. ; and here are two Egyptian black marble statues, found at Tivoli. On
        the sides of the gallery are the busts, reliefs, &c.', 1]

        \ 1.711', the inclination of the orbit about 17\xB0, and the length of the\
        \ part of the cycle within which showers might be ex pected 2.25 years. From\
        \ these definitely ascertained results he deduced the highly important conclusion\
        \ that the periodic time of the group of bodies from which the me teors proceed\
        \ must be one of the five follow ing, and no other, viz., 179.915 days, 185.413\
        \ days, 354.586 days, 376.575 days, or 33.25 years. It remained only, by applying\
        \ the principles of physical astronomy, to com pute the amount of annual procession\
        \ of the node for each of these five orbits, and, by comparing the results\
        \ with the observed procession, to determine which of the five orbits is the\
        \ true one. This computation Professor Newton suggested as the experi mentum\
        \ crueis ; but delaying to apply it him self, the honor was snatched from\
        \ him by Mr. Adams, of Cambridge, England, who demonstrated that the only\
        \ orbit of the five which fulfills the conditions is that which belongs to\
        \ the period of 33.25 years. these bodies must have the average density of\
        \ our harder rocks; and the numerous spec imens in cabinets of the fragmentary\
        \ por tions of them which have forced their way through the atmospheric shield\
        \ by which our planet is protected against their de structive impact are many\
        \ of them largely or wholly composed of metal. The intense interest excited\
        \ in all classes of persons by the meteoric display of 1833 turned the at\
        \ tention of a multitude of observers in this and other countries to the study\
        \ of these phenomena \u2014 a study which was pursued both by the careful\
        \ examination of records for the discovery of past examples of similar occurrences,\
        \ and by the direct and continu ous observation of the heavens themselves.\
        \ The scientific journals of the period bear striking witness to the activity\
        \ of these in vestigators. One of the most successful among them was Mr. E.\
        \ C. Herrick, of New Haven, at that time, or later, librarian of Yale College,\
        \ who presently announced the disco very of three or four additional periods\
        \ of periodical shooting -star abundance or star showers, viz., in January,\
        \ August, April, and December. In regard to the August period, Quetelet, of\
        \ Brussels, was afterward found to have anticipated him, but his dis covery\
        \ of the others was original. Since that time observation in many quarters\
        \ has been so persistent and so fruitful of results as to justify the statement\
        \ that there are not fewer than fifty different days in the year on which\
        \ there is a tendency to a me teoric display above the average. Professor\
        \ Newton followed up his success with the November meteors by investiga tions\
        \ hardly less remarkable of the numer ous irregularly occurring bodies of\
        \ this class called sporadic. From a very large number of determinations of\
        \ the altitudes of these bodies above the earth, he formed a table arranging\
        \ the observations in groups be tween limits of altitude regularly increas\
        \ ing, by which it appeared that few are seen at heights greater than 180\
        \ kilometers and few below 30 kilometers, the mean altitude on the whole being\
        \ 95.55 kilometers. He then, by a course of very ingenious reason ing and\
        \ analysis, proceeded to demonstrate that the number of meteors which traverse\
        \ some part of the earth's atmosphere daily, and are large enough to be visible\
        \ to the naked eye (sun, moon, and clouds permit ting), amounts to more than\
        \ seven and a half millions. Including those fainter bod ies of this class\
        \ which escape the unaided eye, but may be detected by the telescope, this\
        \ number must be greatly increased. Taking as a basis of calculation the num\
        \ ber of telescopic meteors observed by Win necke between July 24 and August\
        \ 3, 1854, with an ordinary comet-seeker of 53' aper ture, the total number\
        \ per day would seem As from the examination of records, an cient and modern,\
        \ the number of observed returns of the November shower was in creased, two\
        \ very important deductions fol lowed \u2014 first, the congeries of bodies\
        \ fur nishing the meteors must extend along its own orbit to a distance equal\
        \ in longitude to about one-sixteenth or one-seventeenth of an entire circumference\
        \ ; and secondly, there must be a continuous advance or pro cession of the\
        \ node, or intersection of the orbit with that of the earth, causing a re\
        \ tardation of the display by about a day at each return. The significancy\
        \ of the accu mulated data was first shown by Professor Newton in 1864, who,\

        \ was written by Dr. Eliot to his friend, Mr. Isaac Smith, a graduate and\
        \ a tutor at Harvard College. In the panic which seized many of the people\
        \ of Boston he embarked at Marblehead for England, May 27, 1775. He was ordained\

        the curious Preface and Index annexed to the Harleyan Catalogue.* The worthy
        Librarian of the Society of Antiquaries, Mr. N orris, deserved acknowledgement
        for the obliging manner in which he gave the editor access to the volumes
        under his care. In Mr. Garrick''s curious collection of old plays are many
        scarce pieces of ancient poetry, with the free use of which he indulged the
        editor in the politest manner. To the Rev. Dr. Birch he is in debted for the
        use of several ancient and valuable tracts. To the friendship of Dr. Samuel
        Johnson .he owes many valuable hints for the conduct of the work. And, if
        the Glossaries are more exact and curious than might be expected in so slight
        a publication, it is to be ascribed to the supervisal of a friend, who stands
        at this time the first in the world for northern literature, and whose learning
        is better known and respected in foreign nations than in his own country.
        It is, perhaps, needless to name the Rev. Mr. Lye, editor of Jtmiuss Etymologiaini,
        and of the Gothic Gospels. The names of so many men of learning and char acter
        the editor hopes will serve as an amulet to guard him from every unfavourable
        censure, for having bestowed any attention on a parcel of old ballads. It
        was at the request of many of these gentlemen, and of others eminent for their
        genius and taste, that this little work was undertaken. To prepare it for
        the press has been the amusement of now and then a vacant hour amid the leisure
        and re tirement of rural life, and hath only served as a re laxation from
        graver studies. It has been taken up at different times, and often thrown
        aside for many months, during an interval of four or five years. This * Since

        compact and dry, and that the conditions for their preservation were exceedingly
        favorable, while in fact they are so much decayed, we may form some estimate
        of their remote an tiquity. In the barrows and cromlechs of the ancient Britons,
        entire and well-preserved skele tons are found, although having an undoubted
        antiquity of eighteen hundred years." There is, however, no safe rule by which
        to judge the an tiquity of human skeletons by the surroundings. Some have
        been kept in a wonderful state of preservation under apparently the least
        favorable conditions, while others have crumbled to dust when it was thought
        they ought to have been preserved. It must be borne in mind that these mounds
        bear no resemblance to Indian burying-grounds. They are the sepulchres of
        a superior people. In 1844 a gentleman in Ohio sent to the librarian of the
        American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts, a cross, the emblem
        of the Chris tian faith. It was made of silver, and was about two and a half
        inches long. It was found on the breast of a female skeleton which was dug
        from a mound at Columbus, over which a forest of trees had grown. On this
        cross the capital letters I. S. are perfectly visible. These initials are
        interpreted to mean the sacred name, Iesus Salvator. A relic which obtained

        \ with no greater amplitude of dress than might have been produced by the\

        \ so that by 1785 they had almost reached tbe standard of modern simplicity.\
        \ Tlie singularities of head-attire, how ever, were not to be abandoned so\
        \ easily; and the forms in which the hair of ladies was worn, as well as the\
        \ fashion of dressing it, were still as capricious as ever. Thus, at the beginning\

        \ for a few hours to grace an occasional court ceremonial. In the mode of\

        \ of 1801, had increased in 181 1 to 901, but these returns included the Forest\
        \ portion since severed. In 1821, the number of inhabitants stood at 934;\
        \ in 1831 at 959 ; and in 1841 at 1,106. They decreased from 974 in 1851 to\
        \ 854 in 1861, but again rose to 901 in 1S71. The population returns shew\
        \ that there exists in Widecombe an exceptional preponderance of the male\
        \ sex. In 1851, there were 524 males and only 464 females. In 1861, 464 males,\
        \ and 390 females ; and, in 1871, there were 469 males and 432 females. In\
        \ these three decennial periods the number of houses were returned at 180,\
        \ 171, and 184 respectively, or an average of 5'i inmates to each house. The\
        \ population, now almost exclusively agricultural, must formerly have included\
        \ a large number of tin miners, the traces of whose surface workings are visible\
        \ in many parts of the combe or vale of Widecombe. In the Itinerary of Leland,\
        \ the Librarian of Henry VIII., we are told that \"The River of Darte by Tynne\
        \ Workes carieth much sand to Totenes Bridge and chokith the Depth of the\
        \ River downeward, and doth much Hurt to Dertmouth Haven.\" To this mischief\
        \ the tinners of Widecombe contri- buted a full share, but whether out of\
        \ compunction for the evil they wrought, or of gratitude for the profits they\
        \ derived, they are said to have been mainly instrumental in upraising the\
        \ glorious tower of the parish church. Westcote, in his view of Devonshire\
        \ (1630), relates \" The course of the River Dart's proceeding and what places\
        \ he passeth by.\" He does not notice the tinners, but tells us that the river\
        \ \"visits Withecombe (anciently called Wydecombe, ) of the coarse and hungry\
        \ soil; having the adjunct of ' in-the-moor,' for such barren places that\
        \ will not easily by the painful labours of the industrious husbandman be\
        \ improved and made fruitful are here.\" The difficulties of the cultivator\
        \ are due rather to the high elevation of the land and the consequent excess\
        \ of cold and moisture, than to any inherent barrenness of the soil. The farms\
        \ are small, even for Devonshire, and they include an unusual proportion which\
        \ have long re- mained the property of the cultivators \u2014 yeomen in the\
        \ true sense of the term. That many of the homesteads are of respectable age\
        \ is shewn by the inscriptions on the arched granite porches which shelter\
        \ the entrance doors of the dwelling houses. At Ash, near Poundsgate, which\
        \ has remained in the Hamlyn family for at least two centuries, are the initials,\
        \ T. H., with the date 1656. In this farm house is preserved a large fragment\
        \ of oak pannelling, with the familiar linen pattern. At Lake, in the same\
        \ locality, are the initials T.H., and he date 1661. At Corndonford, we find\
        \ inscribed 1718 and the letters R.W. The porch at Bittleford bears the date\
        \ 1705 and the letters R. T. Foxworthy has 1770, and Chittleford 16S6. The\
        \ little bridge over the West Webburn, at Pondsworthy, bears the date 1666.\

        that the population did not amount to four thousand at the end of the reign
        of Charles the Second. The effects of a species of toil singularly unfavourable
        to the health and vigour of the human frame were at once discerned by every
        traveller. A large proportion of the people had distorted limbs. This is that
        Sheffield which now, with the dependencies, contains a hundred and twenty
        thousand souls, and whith sends forth its admirable knives, razors, and lancets
        to the farthest ends of the world. Birmingham had not been thought of sufficient
        importance to return a member to Oliver''s Parliament. Yet the manu facturers
        of Birmingham Avere already a busy and thriving race. They boasted that their
        hardware was highly esteemed, not indeed as now, at Pekin and Lima, at Bokhara
        and Tim buctoo, but in London, and even as far off as Ireland. They had acquired
        a less honourable renown as coiners of bad money. In allusion to their spurious
        groats, some Tory wit had fixed on demagogues, who hypocritically affected
        zeal against Popery, the nickname of Birminghams. Yet in 1685 the population,
        which is now little less than two hundred thousand, did not amount to four
        thousand. Birmingham buttons were just beginning to be known : of Birmingham
        guns nobody had yet heard ; and the place whence, two ge nerations later,
        the magnificent editions of Baskerville went forth to astonish all the librarians
        of Europe, did not contain a single regular shop where a Bible or an almanack
        could be bought. On Market days a bookseller named Michael Johnson, the father
        of the great Samuel Johnson, came over from Lich field, and opened a stall
        during a few hours. This supply of literature Avas long found equal to the
        demand. These four chief seats of our great manufactures deserve especial
        mention. It would be tedious to enumerate all thc populous and opulent hives
        of industry which, a hundred and fifty years ago, were hamlets without parish
        churches, or deso late moors, inhabited only by grouse and wild deer. Nor

        certain, first, that the letters are very bad; secondly, that they are spurious
        ; and thirdly, that, whether they be bad or good, spurious or genuine, Temple
        could know nothing of the matter ; inasmuch as he was no more able to construe
        a line of them than to decipher an Egyptian obelisk. This Essay, silly as
        it is, Avas exceedingly well received, both in England and on the Continent.
        And the reason is evident. The classical scholars who saw its absurdity were
        generally on the side of the ancients, and were inclined rather to veil than
        to expose the blunders of an ally ; the champions of the moderns Avere generally
        as ignorant as Temple himself ; and the multitude was charmed by his flowing
        and melodius diction. He was doomed, however, to smart, as he well deserved,
        for his vanity and folly. Christchurch at Oxford Avas then Avidely and justly
        cele brated as a place Avhere the lighter parts of classical learning were
        cultivated Avith success. With the deeper mysteries of philology neither the
        instructors nor the pupils had the smallest acquaintance. They fancied themselves
        Scaligers, as Bentley scornfully said, if they could write a copy of Latin
        verses with only two or three small faults. From this College proceeded a
        new edition of the Letters of Phalaris, which were rare, and had been in request
        since the appearance of Temple''s Essay. The nominal editor was Charles Boyle,
        a young man of noble family and promising parts ; but some older members of
        the society lent their assistance. While the work Avas in prepara tion, an
        idle quarrel, occasioned, it should seem, by the negligence and misrepresentations
        of a bookseller, arose be tween Boyle and the King''s Librarian, Richard Bentley.
        Boyle, in the preface to his edition, inserted a bitter reflection on', 1]

        a porch, heavy in its pro portions when compared with the other parts of the
        structure, from which a covered flight of stone steps leads to the upper storey.
        A wooden spirelet, coated with Muntz''s metal, springs from the high roof,
        and reaches to an elevation of 144 feet from the ground. The brass chandeliers
        hung throughout the rooms of the " Frere Hall " were the work of the Harbour
        Improvement Works Department, and are similar in design to those used in Trinity
        Church. The grounds in which the hall stands are now enclosed by a stone wall

        the residence of the Commissioner in Sind, is situate in the Civil Lines quarter,
        and stands in a large walled inclosure with its front facing the west. It
        consists of a central building with two wings, approached by a carriage-drive
        from five different directions, and was originally built by Sir Charles Napier,
        when Governor of this Province, and from him purchased by Government in 1847
        for the then Commissioner in Sind, Mr. Pringle. The entire cost to Government
        of this edifice, with houses, stables, &c, was 48,273 rupees. The interior
        ar rangements are well adapted for comfort and convenience, but the exterior
        cannot be said to have any pretension whatever to archi tectural taste. The
        upper storey of the central building was added by the late General John Jacob,
        when Acting Commissioner in Sind in 1856. The present Commissioner''s office
        was formerly a private residence, but was purchased by Government in 1855.
        Great additions have of late been made to it. That portion now used as a printing
        establishment had previously been the office of the Assistant Commissioner

        early advantages, vouchsafed to but few indeed. For three years after his
        admission to the bar he was librarian of the Interior Department, where he
        had nothing to do but to store bis mind with that classical aud scientific
        lore that so often crops out in his speeches. He certainly improved to its
        fullest extent this golden opportunity, for there is scarcely an author of
        any distinction with which he is not familiar, and the variety and extent
        of bis information is a marvel to those of less studious habits. In addition,
        be has been an eye-witness to some of the most stirring and inspiring scenes
        in our country''s history : such as the trial of Daniel E. Sickles for the
        murder of Key ; the farewell and departure of the Southern Senators ; the
        inauguration and the assassination of Lincoln ; the trial of Mrs. Surratt
        ; the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, etc. When his friend Judge Browning severed
        his connection with Mr. Johnson''s Cabinet and retired to his home iu Quincy,
        Colonel Normile fouud no ties to bind him to Washington society, and so resolved
        to seek new fields to employ his talents ; and in pursuance of this design
        he landed in this city in May 1869, a knight errant in quest of fortune. Strangely
        enough, for one of his industrious habits, he remained idle for some months,
        when an unfortunate event first called public attention to him, and made him
        for a time the observed of all observers. It happened thus : A well-known
        citizen, Mi''. Muuson Beach, was one summer evening shot dead ou his own door-step,
        while surrounded by bis family. The assassin fled, but was* subsequently arrested.
        He proved to be Joseph H. Fore, a brother-in-law of the murdered man, very
        aristocratically connected, belonging to one of the first families of Kentucky.
        A thrill of horror ran through the entire community at what was considered
        a cruel, cold-blooded and unprovoked murder. On the day set for the trial
        of Fore, the court-room was packed to its densest capacity by an eager and
        excited crowd. All eyes were turned on the prisoner at the bar ; and when
        they noticed how young and handsome he was : when they saw his lovely wife
        weeping at his side, and the look of sorrowful tenderness which he bent upon
        her, a universal feeling of sympathy pervaded tbe entire audience, mingled
        with regret at what seemed to be his inevitable fate. "Who is going to defend
        him?" was a question frequently asked. "A young lawyer named Normile," was
        the response. "Who is he?" and the invariable answer was: "I never heard of
        him before." The plea of the defense was that the defendant was insane. Experts

        \ Mr. Bates at the table without knowing who he was. Mr. Bates expressed a\
        \ desire to take up with him on his own hook, and thus a friendship was begun\
        \ which lasted for twenty -five years \u2014 until the death of Mr. Bates.\

        \ ; and, although seldom attending the meetings, he has always taken a deep\

        \ years (although spendiug much of his time in the office of Mr. Bates), and,\
        \ until the death of Mr. Spaulding, was on terms of the warmest friendship\
        \ with him, and afterward with his family. He has always expressed the profouudest\
        \ regard for the learning and upright ness of his old tutor. During the time\
        \ he was studying law, he applied himself to the acquisition of the French\
        \ and German languages, and became sufficiently proficient in both of them\
        \ to transact legal business in either tongue. He received only one quarter's\
        \ instruction in French, and had no instructor in German. Mr. Gibson has always\
        \ taken a deep interest in national politics. He has never taken part in a\
        \ city election, and never in a State election, unless it had some bearing\
        \ on national affairs. He made some speeches for Henry Clay, in 1844, before\
        \ he was of age or entitled to vote ; and although he has never been a candidate\
        \ for office, he has taken a prominent part in every presidential election\
        \ since that time. In 1848, he supported General Taylor. In 1852, he supported,\
        \ and was an elector for, General Scott, of whom he was a great admirer. Iu\
        \ 1856, and afterwards, he was an Old Line Whig, and iu that year exerted\
        \ himself strenuously to obtain for Edward Bates the nomination of that party\
        \ for President. The inroads upon it, however, by the \"Know-Nothing\" party\
        \ were so great that the attempt failed. The leaders of the party earnestly\
        \ desired that Mr. Bates and Mr. Gibson should join them, but they both declined\
        \ to do so. In 1860, he originated, and was the prime mover in, the proposition\
        \ to nominate Edward Bates as the Republican candidate for the Presidency\
        \ in the National Convention which assembled at Chicago in May of that year.\

        \ made in 1148, and the Boldon Book, containing the returns for the county\
        \ of Durham, made in 1183. The five books have been published in four folio\
        \ volumes, in modern type, but with the original contractions. The Great Domesday\
        \ Book, forming the first two volumes, were published in 1783, and the lesser\
        \ books forming the last two volumes, by the Record Commissioners, in 1816,\
        \ under the Editorship of Sir Henry Ellis, the former principal Librarian\
        \ of the British Museum, who also wrote a General Introduction, in two volumes,\
        \ now out of print. In 1860, Her Majesty's Government, with the concurrence\
        \ of the Rolls, applied the art of photo-zincography to the production of\
        \ a sac simile of Domesday Book, under the superintendence of Colonel Sir\
        \ Henry James, R.E., director of the Ordnance Survey, Southampton. The sac\
        \ simile was completed in 1863. A translation of the part referring to Kent,\
        \ Sussex, and Surrey, by Samuel Henshall and John Wilkinson, was published\
        \ in 1799. Many conjectures have been made as to the derivation of the word\
        \ Domesday. Some have considered that from the difinitive authority of the\
        \ book from which, as from the sentence pronounced at domesday or the Day\
        \ of Judgment, there could be no appeal, the name of the book was derived,\
        \ but Stowe is of opinion that it is a corruption of Domus Dei Book, a title\
        \ given it because heretofore deposited in the King's treasury in a place\

        \ Sebastian Cabot,\" as it is called, though interesting for the main facts\
        \ to which it testifies, is entitled to no credit as strictly accurate evidence\
        \ as to details, inasmuch as the narrative was not repeated by him \u2014\
        \ the Pope's Legate in Spain who had it from Cabot, till years had passed\
        \ away, and then some months elapsed before it was put in writing by the author\
        \ \u2014 Ramusio \u2014 who first published it, and who cautioned his readers\
        \ that he only presumed \" to sketch out briefly, as it were, the heads of\
        \ what I re member of it.\" No reliance, of course, can be put upon such a\
        \ docu ment on any disputed point. Other old chroniclers, however, notably\
        \ Fabian, Stow, and Gomara, speak of Sebastian Caboto as the navigator \"\
        \ very expert and cunning in knowledge of the circuit of the world, and islands\
        \ of the same as by a sea card,\" who demonstrated to King Henry VII. the\
        \ feasibility of a northwest passage to the Indies, and who was sent to find\
        \ it ; and on these writers Hakluyt l relied for his account of the voyage.\
        \ But Hakluyt substituted the name of John, the father, for that of Sebastian\
        \ the son,2 and subsequent authors have, for the most part, accepted his correction.\
        \ Then the question of late is still further complicated by a MS. of Hakluyt's\
        \ recently brought to light.3 In this the great IIakluvt-s chronicler asserts\
        \ not only that the first expedition was com- thTcabot* manded by Sebastian\
        \ Cabot, but that the voyage itself was v\xB0yase made in 1496. His words\
        \ are : \" A great part of the continent, as well as of the islands, was first\
        \ discovered for the King of England by Sebastian Gabote, an Englishman, born\
        \ in Bristow, son of John Gabote, in 1496.\" And again: \"Nay, more, Gabote\
        \ discovered this large tract of firme land two years before Columbus ever\
        \ saw any part of the continent Columbus first saw the firme lande August\
        \ 1, 1498, but Gabote made his great discovery in 1496.\" 4 There is certainly\
        \ no trustworthy evidence, and little of any sort, of a voyage by either the\
        \ father or the son in that year, and the main difficulty here is to reconcile\
        \ Hakluyt to himself. It is less easy to dispose of a map discovered about\
        \ twenty years ago in Germany7, and which is in conflict with all the statements\
        \ upon this point hitherto relied upon. The map,5 which is now in the im perial\

        \ the bridge in an inexplicable manner. No words can describe the scene.\"\
        \ Forster adds, that Dickens never ab solutely recovered from the nervous\
        \ shock of that calamitous occurrence. \"I am curiously weak,\" he wrote later\
        \ in the month; \"weak as if I were recovering from a long illness I begin\
        \ to feel it more in my head. I sleep well and eat well ; but I write half\
        \ a dozen notes, and turn faint and sick I am getting right, though still\
        \ low in pulse, and very nervous. Driving into Eochester yesterday, I felt\
        \ more shaken than I have been since the accident.\" Indeed, considering all\
        \ the cir cumstances which tended to interrupt his writing, while en gaged\
        \ on \" Our Mutual Friend,\" it is curious that there are so few evidences\

        \ no apparent natural connection between lotteries and literature, but one\
        \ of the earliest Acts of the Governor and Judges provided for four lot teries\
        \ for the purpose of raising $20,000 \" for the promotion of literature and\
        \ the improvement of De troit.\" The only literature, however, that resulted\
        \ therefrom is a copy of the Act itself. The earliest practical endeavor for\
        \ the founding of a public library secured the establishment of the gentleman\
        \ desired I would take any book I pleased, and not think about payment or\
        \ deposit. I remonstrated, and repre sented that I was a stranger at an inn\
        \ \u2014 that my stay was uncertain; and the reply was that from a lady and\
        \ a stranger he could not think of receiving any remuneration, and then gave\
        \ himself some trouble to look out the book I wished for, which I took away\
        \ with me. He did not even ask the name of the hotel at which I was staying\
        \ : and when I returned the books persisted in declin ing all payment from\
        \ \" a lady and a stranger.\" Soon after her visit, this society was merged\
        \ into the City Library of Detroit. Detroit Young Men's Society. The society\
        \ was organized in March, and incor porated on August 26, 18 1 7. It is remarkably\
        \ cred itable to the citizens of that time that, the next day after the organization\
        \ of the society, ninety shares of the stock were sold at five dollars each.\
        \ The library was located in the old University building, and the teachers\
        \ of the University acted as librarians. The history of this organization\
        \ is as follows : Near the close of 1832 a few young men met in the store\
        \ of Messrs. John Clark & Company, on Jeffer son Avenue, between Woodward\
        \ and Griswold, to devise means for greater intellectual improvement. A second\
        \ meeting was held at the office of Charles Larned, on the corner of Woodward\
        \ Avenue and Larned Street. These preliminary meetings resulted in the holding\
        \ of a more formal meeting at the ses sion room of the First Presbyterian\
        \ Church, where, on January 18, 1833, a constitution and by-laws were adopted,\
        \ and the Detroit Young Men's Society organized by the election of the following\
        \ officers : president, Franklin Sawyer ; vice-president, Douglas Houghton\
        \ ; corresponding * secretary, George E. Hand; recording secretary, J. R.\
        \ Scott (soon suc ceeded by Jacob M. Howard) ; treasurer, S. S.Haw kins ;\
        \ auditor, W. A. Wells ; managers, Charles W. Penny, John M. Hunter, Aaron\
        \ B. Rawles, Silas Titus, Silas P. Griswold, H. M. Roby, and Ira Van Nortwich.\
        \ After the organization, meetings for literary exercises and debates were\
        \ held every Fri day evening during the winter months. Either at the session\
        \ room or the council room, Dr. Douglas Houghton delivered their first lecture,\
        \ and from time to time other citizens engaged in debates and literary exercises\
        \ ; in fact, most of our older and leading lawyers and politicians, living\
        \ and dead, made their first speeches before' this society. Anson Burlingame,\
        \ afterwards United States minister to China and Chinese ambassador extraordinary,\
        \ then a law student here, made his maiden speech in the old session room.\
        \ The library was kept at the store of Mr. Hallock, and subsequently, until\
        \ the erection On July 15, 1 83 1, the Detroit Athen\xE6um, a club reading\
        \ room, was organized with the following officers : Lewis Cass, president\
        \ ; John Biddle, vice president ; R. S. Rice, treasurer ; and H. S. Cole,\
        \ secretary. The rooms were on Griswold Street, in the rear of Newberry &\
        \ Kercheval's store, where the First National Bank is now located. The effects\
        \ of the City Library were transferred to this new organization. It is probable\
        \ that Mrs. Jameson refers to the rooms of this society in her \" Winter Tours\
        \ and Summer Rambles,\" where, speaking of Detroit, she says : There is also\
        \ a great number of booksellers' shops, and I read in the papers long lists\
        \ of books, newly arrived and unpacked, which the public are invited to inspect.\
        \ Wishing to borrow some books to while away the long, solitary hours in which\
        \ I am obliged to rest, I asked for a circulating library, and was directed\
        \ to the only one in the place. I had to ascend a steep staircase, so disgustingly\
        \ dirty that it was necessary to draw my drapery carefully around me to escape\
        \ pollution. On entering a large room, unfurnished except with book-shelves,\
        \ I found several men sitting, or rather sprawling, upon chairs and reading\
        \ the newspapers. The collection of books was small, but they were not of\
        \ a common or vulgar description. I found some of the best modern publications\
        \ in French and English. The man \u2014 gentleman I should say, for all are\

        \ the east side of Woodward Avenue, near the Grand Circus. By arrangement\
        \ with the Y. M. C. A., the lectures for the season of 1 879-1 880 were given\
        \ in their hall and under the joint auspices of the two associations. On March\

        \ Sill, on the northeast corner of First and Wayne Streets, for the purpose\
        \ of organizing this society. Professor Sill was called to the chair, and\
        \ F. Woolfenden elected secre tary. Mr. E. C. Skinner stated that the object\
        \ of the meeting was the organization of a scientific associa tion, with the\
        \ purpose of establishing a permanent museum, and cultivating a love for the\
        \ study of natural history and general science. A committee, consisting of\
        \ J. C. Holmes, E. C. Skinner, Dr. G. P. Andrews, and F. Woolfejiden, was\
        \ appointed to draft a constitution and by-laws. On April 16 the association\
        \ was fully organized by the adoption of a constitution and the election of\
        \ the following officers: President, G. P. Andrews; first vice-presi dent,\
        \ E. C. Skinner; second vice-president, J. M. B. Sill; treasurer, C. C. Cad\

        \ librarian, J. C. Holmes; curators, D. F. Henry, F. Steams, and H. Gillman.\
        \ In June, 1880, the Museum was moved to one of the vacant buildings of Harper\
        \ Hospital, and in May, 1883, it was placed in the second story of the Detroit\
        \ Medical College building on Farmer Street. From the beginning, the intention\
        \ has been to have the Museum open and free on Tuesday, Thurs day, and Saturday\
        \ evenings, and Saturday after noons. During the winter months of several\
        \ years free lectures were given on Wednesday evenings, mostly by members\
        \ of the association, and the lec tures, generally upon scientific subjects,\
        \ were at tended by large and appreciative audiences. On May 6, 1874, Room\
        \ 9, on the third floor of the Moffat Building, was leased for the use of\
        \ the asso ciation, and here the Museum began. The room being too small for\
        \ a lecture-room, the weekly meetings for business and lectures were held\
        \ in Pro fessor Sill's school building. In July, 1874, the Museum was moved\
        \ to a larger room on the same floor, and in August of this year the association\
        \ ob tained subscriptions for, and purchased of Henry A. Ward his college\
        \ series of casts of fossils, at a cost of $2,000. A larger and more suitable\
        \ room was now a necessity, and in September, 1 874, the upper story of the\
        \ old Odd Fellows' Hall, on the west side of Woodward Avenue, was obtained.\
        \ The Museum was formally opened in its new quarters by a series of receptions\

        \ the association were notified that the rooms occupied by the Museum must\
        \ be vacated by the first of April, 1877, as the old building was to give\

        \ year, and six lady assistants, with salaries ranging from $400 to $450 each.\
        \ When first opened, no person under eighteen might draw books from the library.\
        \ On September 4, 1 87 1, the rules were amended to permit persons over fifteen\
        \ to use the library. Under these rules any resident of the city, for whom\
        \ some approved person becomes security, may draw books upon an agreement\
        \ being signed by both principal and surety to abide by the rules. Only one\
        \ book may be drawn at a time. Prior to March 20, 1871, a ledger account was\
        \ kept with each person drawing books ; since that date persons wishing to\
        \ draw books fill out a blank slip, furnished by the board, with the name\
        \ of the book wanted, their own name and residence, and from their library\
        \ card the page and line of the Record Book where their name will be found.\
        \ Each person drawing books is furnished with a card with double columns for\
        \ date of draw ing and returning, on which, as a book is drawn or returned,\
        \ the date of the transaction is stamped. Fourteen days is the ordinary limit\

        \ any time prior to the lapse of the fourteen days, it may be retained for\
        \ four weeks. If no notice for renewal is given, a fine of two cents per day\
        \ is col lected for each day that a book is detained without such renewal.\
        \ Under the Act of 1881, providing for a special tax for library purposes,\
        \ there was received the first year the sum of $15,170, and as the tax is\
        \ made obligatory, a successful financial future is well assured. The library\
        \ is primarily under the control of the Board of Education, and was originally\
        \ managed by a committee of the board, and all books were selected subject\
        \ to their approval. By Act of March 31, 1871, the board was authorized to\
        \ appoint a Board of Commissioners, and transfer the library to their care\
        \ ; the board to consist of six persons, the first members to be chosen for\
        \ one, two, three, four, five, and six years ; one member to be elected yearly\
        \ thereafter for the term of six years, the president of the Board of Education\
        \ to be a member ex-officio. No action was taken under this Act, and mean\
        \ time ten years passed away, and the funds received from fines so diminished\
        \ in amount that the man agement of the library became a burden to the board.\
        \ They then became willing to share their responsibility, and with their approval,\
        \ on March 11, 1 88 1, an Act embodying substantially the same pro visions\
        \ as that of 1871 was passed, with the addi tional provision that a city tax\

        and a yearly average of one hundred women and one hundred and twenty-five
        children are cared for. It is supported by membership dues, House of Providence.
        This home for destitute and abandoned children, and lying-in hospital for
        unfortunate and destitute females, is conducted by the Sisters of Charity,
        with Sister Mary Stella in charge. It was organized in 1869, and incorporated
        in 1872. It cares for chil dren until they are six years of age, after which
        time they are given for adoption or transferred to an orphan asylum. It has
        in its care a yearly aver age of one hundred and ten children and seventy
        women. The home, opened in August, 1869, was originally situated on Fourteenth
        Avenue, between Dalzelle and Marantette Streets. On March 24, 1876, it was
        moved to the Old Beaubien homestead, on the northwest corner of St. Antoine
        and Elizabeth Streets. The house is maintained by sums paid for board and
        by voluntary donations. The cost of maintenance, including probable value
        of contribu tions of food, is about $4,000 per year. The prop erty is worth

        practically one of the charities of Detroit. Rev. G. Speckhard was the founder
        and first teacher of the society, which was organized March 10, 1873, One
        of the most unique features of this charity has been its Baby Receptions.
        The first of these was held June 10, 1874, when twenty-six little ones, dressed
        in their best and decorated with ribbons, received their friends. Attached
        to the breast of each child was a card bearing its name and age. It was a
        pretty sight, and one that appealed so strongly to compassionate hearts, that
        at the second recep tion, in the following December, only one of the twenty-six
        remained. The annual meeting is on the first Tuesday in January. The board
        is composed of two ladies from each of the Protestant churches. The prop erty
        is held by eleven trustees. The chief officers have been: Presidents: 1868,
        Mrs. R. Hawley; 1869-1871, Mrs. L. L. Page; 1871-1876, Mrs. R. Hawley; 1876-1878,

    - ['PREFACE. XII obtaining subjects for engravings to represent the present period,
        and the gathering of data for some of the specially important pictures, proved
        both difficult and expensive. In certain representations I was fortunate in
        securing the aid of C. W. Sumner, who successfully carried out my desires.
        Where any picture has been produced without an original from which to copy,
        the utmost care has been taken to have the illustration conform to the facts,
        and the few drawings for such pictures, before being engraved, were submitted
        for criticism to competent persons. In the various parts of one picture there
        are facts obtained from a daguerreotype, from an old photograph of a still
        older lithograph, from an original architect''s plan, from a pencil-sketch
        by a former carpenter who has for many years been an esteemed minister; several
        old deeds were also consulted, and all the facts obtained, as well as the
        results of a dozen interviews with competent critics, are embodied in the
        engraving. In producing the engravings the aim has been historic accuracy
        rather than artistic effect, and what may be lacking in the finish of some
        pictures is intended to be more than made up in the fullness and range of
        illustrations contained in the volume. In making the engravings of buildings
        and scenes of the present day, the photographs, in nearly every case, were
        taken specially for this work ; and in collecting all of the materials, where
        information was to be obtained, no question of time, or toil, or cost has
        been considered. Every person, place, book, or depository promising information
        upon any subject relating to the city has been laid under contribution. Every
        clue has been followed, every suggested receptacle searched, and every individual
        interviewed that there was reason to suppose could aid in the work. In collecting
        and compiling, the following plan was pursued. I first searched everywhere
        for everything of interest on every subject, and carefully copied what was
        found. All the facts were next classified by subjects, and then arranged in
        chronological order. Each subject was afterwards taken up separately, and
        written out as fully as the facts obtained would allow. Points or details
        found to be lacking were noted, the necessary details looked up, and the several
        subjects were then again rewritten. Finally, during the ten years the work
        has been in preparation, careful attention has been paid to all events pertaining
        to the history of the city ; these have been noted and added as they occurred,
        and up to the time of going to press the several subjects are believed to
        be complete. Both in the text and in the illustrations certain information
        is given, which, if not of great present value, will become of service as
        the years progress. In putting into shape the materials I have gathered I
        have sought to be candid and accurate, and hope that no evidences of narrowness
        or bigotry can be shown. The variety of subjects made any methodical and proper
        classification very difficult. The arrangement finally adopted was carefully
        thought over, and is believed to be as convenient and appropriate as possible.
        A small amount of space has been devoted to business interests. Without stores
        and manufactories no city could exist, and the establishments represented
        find legitimate place in a history intended to be complete. In view of the
        magnitude of the work and the minuteness of the information it contains, it
        will be strange indeed if no errors are discovered ; every effort has, however,
        been made to insure accuracy, and the author will greatly appreciate the courtesy
        of any person giving information that will in any way add to the value or
        completeness of future editions. The full and careful index was compiled,
        partly as a labor of love, because of his interest in the work, by Prof. Henry
        Chaney, formerly Librarian of the Public Library. The mention of this fact
        is a guarantee that it has been prepared with scholarly care. In the final
        completion of the volume I have been materially aided by the courteous and
        competent foreman of the Free Press Book Room, Mr. Louis Beckbissinger ; he
        has made numerous practical and valuable suggestions, and has faithfully supervised
        the work. With these statements I confidently submit the volume to all who
        have an appreciation of local history ; and if the public experience in reading,
        a tithe of the pleasure that I have found in gathering and gleaning, I am
        sure of grateful remembrance. S. F. Detroit, August, 1884.', 1]

        \ resolved to erect a block to cover their entire property, and pre paratory\
        \ to building, the library was removed to vacant rooms over Chauncey Hurlbut's\
        \ store on Woodward Avenue. $60,000 were borrowed on the property, and the\
        \ erection of the building was begun. The contractors failed to have it ready\
        \ in time to secure tenants, and being unable to meet their engagements, on\
        \ May 22, 1876, the president and secretary made an assignment to Horace M.\
        \ Dean, J. H. Van Schoick, and James Burns, for the benefit of the creditors.\
        \ The debts were $117,000, and the assets were estimated at $173,000. The\
        \ depreciation in real estate caused the entire prop erty to be sold on November\

        \ released by the creditors, and temporarily stored in the fourth story of\
        \ the Moffat Building. On August 1, 1877, the Detroit Young Men's Chris tian\
        \ Association made a proposition to the trustees to provide a room and librarian\
        \ and proper care for the books, and also to furnish the society with a room\
        \ for their meetings for the term of five years, on condition that the members\
        \ of their society be allowed to use the books. The proposition was accepted,\
        \ the books removed, and the library form ally opened for use in the rooms\
        \ of the Y. M. C. A. on September 19, 1877. In April, 1881, the Y. M. C. A.\

        \ A preliminary meeting in the interest of this so ciety, held on April 21,\
        \ 1871, resulted in the adoption of a constitution and the completion of an\
        \ organiza tion on May 4. It was at first called the Pioneer Society of Detroit,\
        \ but on March 23, 1874, the name was changed as above. The first officers\
        \ were : Levi Bishop, president ; Luther Beecher and Thomas Lewis, vice-presidents;\
        \ S. G. Wight, secretary; W. A. Bacon, treasurer. After Mr. Bacon's death,\
        \ in April, 1873, Seymour Finney was elected treasurer. The object of the\
        \ society is to collect and pre serve historical and biographical data pertaining\
        \ to the county. The annual meeting is held on April 21, and a semi-annual\
        \ meeting on October 21, with other meetings at the call of the Executive\
        \ Com mittee, which is composed of the president, secre tary, and treasurer.\

        \ dues of one dollar thereafter, are required of members. Assess ments of\
        \ not more than five dollars a year may also be made. The society has obtained\
        \ a large number of interesting biographical and historical sketches from\

        \ State, by virtue of its original colonial charter, possessed this portion\
        \ of the West has been frequently discussed. The claim of Virginia seems as\
        \ well founded as that of any of the other States, and her claims were fortified\
        \ by the fact that she was the only colonial State that ever attempted to\
        \ exercise authority or jurisdiction in the Territories north and west of\
        \ the Ohio. In October, 1778, as appears by the Statutes at Large (Vol. IX.,\
        \ page 557), the Assembly of Virginia organized the territory on the west\
        \ of the Ohio, adjacent to the Mississippi, into the county of Illinois, and\
        \ appointed Colonel John Todd military commandant. It is also shown by a letter\
        \ from Winthrop Sargent, addressed to the President on July 31, 1790, and\
        \ quoted in American State Papers, Public Land Series, Vol. I., that Todd\
        \ transferred certain powers to a Mr. Legras, and that a court was held at\
        \ Vincennes and various acts performed under direction of its judges. This\
        \ would seem to be almost conclusive evidence of the rights of Virginia. North\

        \ the interest of the land company he represented, it is presumably the portion\
        \ excluding slavery and providing for schools that is attributable to him.\
        \ Further evidence of his authorship is contained in an elaborate article\

        \ the way for the cession, a law was passed in October, 1780, providing that\
        \ the territory to be ceded should be disposed of for the common benefit of\
        \ the whole Union ; that the States erected therein should be of suitable\
        \ extent, not less than one hundred nor more than one hundred and fifty miles\
        \ square. After the passage of this law, on March 1, 1781, New York released\
        \ her claims; Virginia, on March 1, 1784; Massachusetts, on April 19, 1785;\

        \ LIBRARY. The members of the legal profession are chiefly congregated on\
        \ Griswold Street. Whole blocks in this vicinity are fitted up with offices\
        \ and suites of rooms especially for their accommodation, provided with every\
        \ convenience in the way of elevators, vaults, and steam-heating apparatus.\
        \ Among the buildings devoted chiefly to lawyers' offices are the Moffat,\
        \ Miller, Buhl, Seitz, Burns, Lewis, Butler, Telegraph, and Mechanics' Blocks,\
        \ and the New berry and McMillan and Campau Buildings. The nucleus of a Bar\
        \ Library must have been formed as early as May 19, 1838, as a vote of the\
        \ Common Council, on that date, gave a room in the City Hall, as a consultation\
        \ and library room, to the \" Bar of the City of Detroit.\" The next effort\
        \ was made on December 15, 1851 ; a meeting of lawyers was then held, and\
        \ on motion of G. V. N. Lothrop a committee of five was appointed to consider\
        \ the subject of establishing a law library. The commit tee apparently never\
        \ reported, and finally, on July 6, 1853, a paper, evidently drawn up by Judge\
        \ C. J. O'Flynn, was circulated among the lawyers, asking for subscriptions\
        \ of one hundred dollars each towards a fund for the purchase of books, and\
        \ authorizing Judge O'Flynn to draw up Articles of Association for a Bar Library.\
        \ Geo. E. Hand, C. J. O'Flynn, G. V. N. Lothrop, C. I. Walker, T. W. Lockwood,\
        \ Levi Bishop, and Wm. Gray united in calling a meeting, and the Association\
        \ was organized on July 21, 1853. A constitution was adopted, the provisions\
        \ of which fixed the capital stock at $15,000, to be represented by one hundred\
        \ and fifty shares, at one hundred dollars per share. The fol lowing were\
        \ the first officers : President, Geo . E. Hand ; Treasurer, T. W. Lockwood\
        \ ; Secretary, J. V. Campbell ; Librarian, Sears Stevens. By law of Northwest\
        \ Territory the power to grant the privilege of practicing law was vested\
        \ in the governor. By law of Michigan Territory, of February 23, 1809, attorneys\
        \ were to be licensed only by the judges of the Supreme Court. A law of October\
        \ I, 1820, provided that any two judges of the Supreme Court might admit to\
        \ practice. On August 31, 1821, a legislative Act was passed admitting S.\
        \ B. Beach to practice as an attorney. At the present time, under State law,\
        \ persons of good moral character, resident in the State, and twenty-one years\
        \ of age, are admitted to practice in the several courts, upon passing a satisfactory\
        \ ex amination before the court, or, as is usually the case, before a committee\
        \ appointed for this purpose by the court. A room in the rotunda was rented,\
        \ and the library duly established. The number of books at commencement was\
        \ estimated at about six hundred volumes, valued at $3,000. At a meeting of\
        \ the stockholders on July 13, 1867, it appeared that the cash valuation of\
        \ the library was $8,437.67, subject to a debt of $2,000, due to A. S. Bagg\
        \ for books. At this meeting the stock was equalized among the stockholders,\
        \ according to the amount each had paid in ; and soon afterwards twenty-two\
        \ shares of stock were issued, for the purpose of paying debts and furnishing\
        \ more books. In July, 1868, the library was removed to the Buhl Block, on\
        \ the southwest corner of Griswold and Congress Streets. A large number of\
        \ the lawyers are united in an organization called \" The Association of the\
        \ Bar of the City of Detroit,\" established under an Act of the Legislature,\
        \ on May 10, 1881. The following original officers were still serving in 1883\
        \ : President, Theodore Romeyn ; Secretary, H. M. Cheever ; Treasurer, Robert\
        \ P. Toms. Not a few pungent anecdotes could be told con cerning members of\
        \ the Detroit Bar. Of the many brilliant and witty retorts that have relieved\
        \ the tedium of court cases, the following will serve as a specimen : A case\
        \ was on trial in the Circuit Court, and each side was present with a formidable\
        \ array of attorneys and counsel. The late A. D. Fraser was to make the closing\
        \ argument for the defence. He commenced by saying that he had listened with\
        \ care to all the evidence, had examined all the points of law, and digested\
        \ the facts in the case ; and having done so, he felt fully acquainted with\

        was sold, and the library occupied rooms in the Bible House, at Eighth Street
        and Fourth Avenue. The lot on which the building it now occupies stands, in
        University Place, was purchased, and the edifice erected upon it was completed
        in the spring of 1856. The library first occupied it in May of that year.
        The first catalogue issued after its removal, printed in 1792, showed that
        the library then contained about five thousand volumes. In 1813 the number
        was thirteen thousand, and in 1830 nearly twenty thousand. It has received
        from time to time valuable donations of books and liberal bequests of money.
        The largest gift the library ever received was that of Mrs. Sarah II. Green,
        from the estate of her de ceased husband, John C. Green. The amount was $50,000.
        It was presented in 1880, with a stipulation that the income from the fund
        should be used for the purchase of books, one half for costly illustrated
        works for " the John C. Green alcove," and one half for works for circulation.
        This alcove of books had its origin in a munificent gift of the late John
        C. Green, of the city of New York. A special attendant has charge of that
        alcove, so that its treasures may always be open for inspection. The income
        from ground rent of property owned by the society in Chatham Street is set
        apart as the income of the " John C. Green Fund." The library now contains
        about eighty thousand volumes. Its shares (with annual dues commuted) are
        $150 each, or by payment of $10 a year, $25. There is a reading-room connected
        with the library, open for the use of shareholders, and of strangers for one
        month when intro duced by a member. Non-members are allowed to consult the
        books by the payment of twenty-five cents each time. The society has no debts.*
        One of the oldest associations in the city of New York, yet in pros perous
        and useful operation, is The Geneeal Society of Mechanics and Teadesmen. It
        has certainly been in existence since 1784. The first meetings of the society
        of which any records exist were held at the house of Walter Hyer, in November,
        17S5, in King''s Street, now Pine Street. In 1S02 the society bought a lot
        (size 26.06 by 98.3 feet) at the corner of (present) Park Place and Broadway,
        yet in its possession, for the sum of $6325. The next year they erected a

        \ whereof twenty one should form a quorum ; that the members of this Upper\
        \ House should be nominated by Cromwell in the first place \u2014 the right\
        \ of filling up vacancies being, however, inherent in the chamber itself ;\
        \ that a constant revenue of \xA31,300,000 a year be granted for the maintenance\
        \ of the army and navy, other supplies being granted by Parlia ment, specially\
        \ as need should arise ; that the Protector's council should consist only\
        \ of \"such as are of known piety and of undoubted affection to the rights\
        \ of these nations,\" even in matters of religious faith ; that this council\
        \ be not removed but by consent of Parliament ; that it shall . appoint to\
        \ the military and naval commands on Cromwell's death; that the Chancellor,\
        \ Treasurer, chief justices, &c, be approved by Parliament ; that Parliament\
        \ should issue a public con fession of faith, to which, however, none should\
        \ be compelled to assent, nor be molested for holding other views so long\
        \ as they did not abuse this liberty ; but that neither Papacy nor Prelacy\
        \ bo suffered. When, however, Parliament once more met in Jan., 1658, Cromwell\
        \ found the Lower House, from which his chief supporters had been withdrawn\
        \ to form the new House of Lords, calling in question all that had been done\
        \ in the previous year. Tho Lower House now refused to recognise the Upper.\
        \ Cromwell, in despair, dissolved Parliament early in 1658, and the Humble\
        \ Petition aiid Advice fell to the ground. of Lord Hertford's successor, the\
        \ Duke of Richmond. He then returned to Edinburgh, where he died. Hume's History\
        \ was long the most widely popular of all the general histories of England.\
        \ This popu larity it owes in great part to the lucid elegance of its style,\
        \ and the literary skiU with which it is composed : qualities which still\
        \ entitle it to rank as an English classic. To the historical student its\
        \ value at the present day is comparatively slight. Hume's acquaintance with\
        \ the subject was not very close, and of the earlier periods and the origin\
        \ and growth of the constitution, he had little accurate knowledge ; nor was\
        \ the time taken in the composition of the Historg sufficient to allow of\
        \ very deep research ; while his narrative of events in the seven teenth century\
        \ is vitiated by his strong prejudice against all who asserted popular rights.\
        \ Still the literary- merits of the book, and the acuteness of some of the\
        \ observations of one of the greatest thinkers of the last century, must always\
        \ give it a certain value of its own. Hume, Joseph (4. 1777, d. 1855), was\
        \ born of humble parents at Montrose. After studying medicine at Edinburgh\
        \ he was appointed surgeon to one of the Indian regiments (1797), and did\
        \ not return home till 1808. From this time he devoted his attention to the\
        \ practical side of English politics, and in 1812 entered Parliament as member\
        \ for Weymouth \u2014 a borough which he did not long continue to represent.\
        \ A few years later he was returned for Aberdeen, and after one or two changes\
        \ finally became member for Montrose. The chief object which Hume set to himself\
        \ as a politician was the reduction os' taxation, and to secure this, reduction\
        \ he investigated and, when necessary, challenged every item of public expenditure.\
        \ But it was not to this line of work only that Mr. Hume confined his attention.\
        \ Almost every branch of domestic policy in turn called for his inquiries\
        \ : he proposed reforms in the army, the navy, and the ecclesiastical courts.\
        \ He secured the repeal of the laws forbidding machinery to be exported, and\
        \ workmen from going abroad. He was also a determined enemy of imprisonment\
        \ for debt, of flogging in the army, and the system of impressment for the\
        \ . navy. In such useful work he passed the last years of his life. Rauke,\
        \ Hist, of Eng. ; Whitelocke, Memorials, 655-661. Hume, David (4. 1711, d.\
        \ 1776), was born at Edinburgh and educated for the law, though his own tastes\
        \ ran strongly in the direction of letters. A few years after coming of age\
        \ he went to France, returning to London in 1737, for the publication of his\
        \ Treatise on Human Nature. It was not till fifteen years later that he published\
        \ his Political Discourses (1752), and about the same time being ap pointed\
        \ librarian of the Faculty of Advocates, conceived the idea of writing a history\
        \ of England. The first volume of this work con taining the reigns of James\
        \ I. and Charles I. was published in 1754, and fell almost still born from\
        \ the press. Two years later appeared the continuation of the History to the\
        \ Revo lution of 1688. In 1759 Hume published his history of the House of\
        \ Tudor, and in 1761 the earlier portion of his history. By this time the\
        \ sale of the now history was very considerable, and its author realised such\
        \ sums of money from the booksellers, that In became, in his own words, \"\
        not only inde pendent but opulent.\" In 1763 he was appointed secretary to\
        \ the Earl of Hertford in his embassy to Paris, and in 1765 remained d'affaires\
        \ in that city, till the arrival Hundred, The. Tacitus, describing the Germans,\
        \ says that their chiefs are assisted in matters of justice by a hundred companions,\
        \ and that in war each pagus, or district, fur nishes a hundred warriors and\
        \ the host. These bands, he tells us, are called \" hun dreds,\" but \" what\
        \ was once a number is now a name only.\" Thus the tribe is divided into \"\
        \ hundreds,\" which are already beginning to lose their connection with a\
        \ definite number", 1]

        \ excited much opposi tion in Scotland, and led, in 1160, to a rebeUion headed\
        \ by six Scottish earls. Malcolm, who was with Henry in France, on the Toulouse\
        \ expedition, hurried back to Scotland, and succeeded in quieting the rebels.\
        \ He also subjected Galloway and Moray in the same year. In 1164 Malcolm again\

        \ and \"do yet find an abounding malignity and opposition in those parties\
        \ and factions, who have been the cause of those evils.\" They go on to say\
        \ that \"the root of aU this mischief\" is \"a maUgnant and pernicious design\
        \ of subverting the funda mental laws and principles of government, upon which\
        \ the reUgion and justice of this kingdom are firmly established.\" Strafford\

        \ form of the maUg nants, which was the term the}- imposed upon aU those they\
        \ meant to render odious to the people.\" Malcolm, natural son of Alexander\
        \ I., conceived the idea of making himself king of the country north of the\
        \ Forth and Clyde, in place of David I. In this project he was aided by Angus\
        \ of Moray. He was, how ever, defeated in 1130, and finally reduced to subjection\
        \ (1134). Malcolm, Sir John (5. 1769, d. 1833), was born at Langholm, in Dumfriesshire.\
        \ In 1783 he went to India as a cadet. He was present during the second Mysore\

        \ where he successfully concluded a treaty of aUiance against the French.\
        \ He acted as private secretary to Lord WeUesley in 1801 \u2014 2. He acted\
        \ as political agent in Lord Lake's camp during the Holkar War, and negotiated\
        \ the Treaty of Raipoor Ghaut (1806). In 1806\u20147 he returned to Mysore,\
        \ to act as Resident. In 1808 he was despatched on a second mission to Persia,\
        \ in which he was totally unsuccess ful. In 1810 he was again sent to Persia,\
        \ and was well received. In 1814 his History of Persia was pubUshed. He was\
        \ present as Madras political agent and general during the Mahratta War (1817\u2014\
        18). He fought with great courage at Mahidpore, and nego tiated the treaties\
        \ with Holkar and Bajee Rao. He was prominent in the settlement of Central\

        \ should have had so great and so lasting a share *-\u2014 ~ of Louvois' interest.\
        \ Why was he not, like Lemaire, discharged, and ordered never again to enter\
        \ France ? or, like Rohan, Van Enden, and Des Preaux, beheaded ? or, like\
        \ Gallet, hanged, to save further trouble? He Avas sent to Pignerol, and,\
        \ though his name is never once mentioned, he evidently remained the object\
        \ of such incessant solicitude to the minister and to the jailer that he ran\
        \ no chance of being, like the Comte de Montemayer, forgotten in his dungeon.\
        \ His life was spared for some reason which LoiiA'ois never divulged, but\
        \ which possibly was one of personal rather than of national importance. Who\
        \ was this De Marchiel? and is there anything known about him to identify\
        \ him further with the masked prisoner ? He was a Lorrainer, and probably\
        \ a bastard of some creditable house, for the families of Ollendorf, Kiffenbach,\
        \ La Tour, Armoises, or Harmoises, whose names he alternately assumed, were\
        \ families not only then existing in Lorraine, but all inter-connected by\
        \ marriage.1 He is known to have lived in Paris and 1 Jung expresses a hope\
        \ that in Lorraine further researches about these families may yet throw some\
        \ light on the mystery. The name of Harmoises once oddly enough did figure\
        \ in a mystification in Lorraine, an impostor so called having tried to personify\
        \ Jeanne d'Arc. I have been able through the kindness of M. Favier, librarian\
        \ of Nancy, and of the late cure of Contrexeville, to satisfy myself that\
        \ the family of Armoises is now extinct in the country. As for the name of\
        \ Marechal, I found it as late as 1738 certainly worn by persons of good birth,\
        \ for a certain Ladislas Marechal de Barcheny is mentioned as ' Vecuyer du\

        he received in pledge the original manuscripts of Aschylus, Sophocles, and
        Euripides. These were carefully copied, and the copies returned to the owners,

        it was decreed, by ordinance of Henry II., " that all booksellers should furnish

        \ his future, and resolved to be honest and industrious, and to avoid gambling.\
        \ Upon this moral basis he built the superstructure of his fame and fortune.\
        \ Young Astor left London for America in November, 1783, bringing with him\
        \ some merchandise for traffic. He was then twenty years of age. An elder\
        \ brother, who had been in America several years, had written to him on the\
        \ advantages offered young men of enterprise in this country. Obtaining from\
        \ a countryman in New York engaged in the furrier business all necessary information\
        \ concerning that pursuit, he invested the proceeds of the sale of his merchandise\
        \ in furs, and was successful from the beginning. His enterprise, guided by\
        \ great sagacity, always kept ahead of his capital, and year after year his\
        \ business expanded. He made regular visits to Montreal, where he bought furs\
        \ of the Hudson Bay Company and shipped them to London. So soon as commercial\
        \ treaties permitted, he sent furs to all parts of the United States, and\
        \ for many years he carried on a very lucrative trade with Canton, China.\
        \ After spending many years as a second-hand operator, and having accumulated\
        \ a large fortune, he resolved to do business on his own account. He traded\
        \ directly with the Indians, who were supplying the North-AA'estern Fur Company\
        \ with the choicest furs. He soon became the rival of this company. In 1809\
        \ the Legislature of New York incorporated the American Fur Com pany, with\
        \ a capital of $1,000,000, with the privilege of extending it to \xA72,000,000.\
        \ Mr. Astor was the president and director \u2014 in a word, he was the company\
        \ ; the capital and management were his own. In 1811 he bought out the North-AVestern\
        \ Company. AA7ith some associates he formed the South-Western Fur Company,\
        \ and they controlled the vast fur trade in the middle regions of America.\
        \ Mr. Astor conceived a still greater enter prise. He saw the great possibilities\
        \ of the Pacific coast in connection with the trade of the East Indies, and\
        \ he contemplated the control of that trade. He resolved to control at least\
        \ the fur trade with China. His plan was to have a line of trading-posts across\
        \ the continent to the mouth of the Coli\\_abia River, lately discovered,\
        \ and ship furs from that point to Asia. He established a fortified post at\
        \ the mouth of the Columbia, which was called Astoria. It was the germ of\
        \ the State of Oregon. Then began a series of opera tions on a scale altogether\
        \ greater than any hitherto attempted by individual enterprise. The history\
        \ of it is full of wildest romance ; it has been told by Irving in two volumes.\
        \ The grand scheme soon failed. There. was war with England. A British armed\
        \ schooner captured Astoria, and British fur-traders entered upon the rich\
        \ field. The United States Government declined to assist Mr. Astor in recovering\
        \ his possessions. His associates disappointed him, and his dream of an empire\
        \ beyond the mountains, \"peopled by free and independent Americans, and linked\
        \ to us by ties of blood and interest,\" vanished like the morning dew. It\
        \ has since become a reality. After the failure of this enterprise Mr. Astor\
        \ gradually withdrew from commercial life. He was the owner of much real estate\
        \ on Manhattan Island, for his sagacity foresaw the growth of the city and\
        \ great appreciation in the value of the land. He was also the holder of a\
        \ large amount of public stocks. His later years were chiefly spent in the\
        \ management of his large and rapidly augmenting estate, which, at his death,\
        \ in March, 1848, amounted in value to several million dollars. The Astor\
        \ Library is his enduring monument.", 1]

        of new Avorks of art, and general conversation make up the chief pleasure
        of the evening. Monthly art receptions are held during the Avinter, and there
        is also a "ladies'' day" once a month. Many distinguished persons in literature,
        art, science, and the learned profes sions haA''e been entertained at dinner
        by the Lotus. The home of the Lotus Club is in a brown-stone front edifice
        on the corner of Twenty-first Street and Fifth AA''enue. It is elegantly fitted
        up, its Avails garnished Avith paintings, and the whole furnished Avith every
        appliance requisite for a first-class club-house. Its membership is limited
        to 600 ; in 1883 it had 400 members. The initiation fee is $200, its annual
        dues $50. In 1882-83 Whitelaw Reid, of the Tribune, was president, Thomas
        W. Knox secretary, and Frederick B. Noyes treasurer. The Neav York Press Club
        was instituted in December, 1872. Active membership in the club is limited
        to persons employed on the public press of the city and A''icinity, to city
        correspondents of news papers abroad, and to gentlemen engaged in literary
        pursuits other than that of journalism. It was first formed by James Pooton,
        Jeremiah J. Roche, and HoAA''ard Carroll, and called the Journalistic Fraternity.
        It received its present name in October, is 71. The first home of the club
        was a small room ; now (1883) it occupies a suite of handsome rooms at Nos.
        119 and 121 Nassau Street, with a fine library, rich in files of neAvspapers
        and reference volumes. The Press Club is one of the best and most flourishing
        of the clubs of New York, and numbers OA''er three hundred and fifty actiA''e
        members and several honorary members. The officers of the club in 1883 were
        : Truman A. Merriman, presi dent ; George W. Pearce, first vice-president
        ; James J. Clancy, second vice-president ; J. W. Keller, third vice-president
        ; William II. StiA''er, treasurer ; George Slater, financial secretary ; Albert
        E. Berg, record ing secretary ; Augustine Healy, corresponding secretary,
        and H. < ''lay Lukens, librarian. Sorosis, a club for women, was organized
        in March, 1868, with the long -cherished object in vieAV of promoting pleasant
        and useful relations among women of thought and culture, and render them helpful

        \ \" We are young \u2014 and I can work,\" cried Arch ambault, deriving a\

        \ gloomy street, in tho immediate of the Cathedral of Notre Dame, there is\
        \ an old house which for many years has not beeu tenanted. Its last occupants\
        \ wore an old man and his daughter ; aud to them my tale has reference. It\
        \ was iu the year 1815, that an individual, of about fifty-five years of age,\
        \ went to inhabit the old house I hare just alluded to. An aged female, with\
        \ a young child in her arms, act ompaniod him to his gloomy abode. The infant\
        \ was his daughter ; and upou her he doted with an excess of tenderness which\
        \ few men ever manifest. But to tbe old nurse he never uttered a word, save\
        \ when the necessity of giving some orders rela tive to his domestic arrangements\
        \ compelled him to break his rigid taciturnity. Sevignei was the name by which\
        \ this mysterious being designated bimself. That of his child was Rose. The\
        \ old woman was called Marguerite. No other lodgers occupied the dreary abo\
        \ ra they ; aud although the dwelling was exten - : Sevigne only furnished\
        \ four or fire apartments, still he refused to let a portion of it to other\
        \ tenants. He was not poor, but he was economical \u2014 or rather, frugal,\
        \ save iu reference to his beloved child ; and on her he lavished every luiiiry.\
        \ as she grew up, which a fond parent could provide. And, certainly, if tbe\
        \ most lovely beings ia this world deserve the most costly things, nothing\
        \ that her father gave her was too good for Rose. At the age of seventeen\
        \ she was the most lovely creature my eyes had ever beheld . the faultleas\
        \ \u25A0ness of her features and matured form rirr just proportions of the\
        \ Venus of Medicis itself. But she belonged to a world whose brightest ornaments\
        \ are born to the most sad destinies ; and a Rose in beauty, as well as in\
        \ name, Bhe shared the rose's fate, aud perished after having bloomed but\
        \ a short time ! In disposition she was as amiable as she was lovely in person.\
        \ The sweetness of her temper was only equalled by the generosity of her character.\
        \ Her manners were replete with frankness and candour \u2014 her soul was\
        \ like an \xC6olian harp that vibrates to tbe slightest breeze . it was ever\
        \ awake to the calls of poverty and to the e-igencies of the needy. But as\
        \ she bad been reared in the utmost igno rance of tbe world, and in au almost\
        \ unbroken solitude (as it may be called, for a creature of her age), she\
        \ was as little acquainted with its virtues as she was with its vices. She\
        \ recognised the difference between pleasure and pain, because sensation was\
        \ tho author of her di rimination in that respect: but tue conven tional forms\
        \ of justice and injustice, turpitude, and virtue were scarcely known by her.\
        \ She was like a beautiful savage \u2014 or a wild flower with a lovely name\
        \ \u2014 a creature whose only divinity is the impulse of Nature. But \u2014\
        \ oh ! so lovely, and so innocent was she \u2014 that beauteous rose \u2014\
        \ that, when imprisoned in the gloomy dwelling from whence she seldom issued,\
        \ she seemed liko a choice plant flourishing, solitary and alone, in the rude\
        \ court of a deserted castle. Or like a beautiful butterfly fluttering amongst\
        \ the mazes of a dark and gloomy forest, was Ro3e in the apartments of her\
        \ father. And yet this angelic being \u2014 this creature \u2014 to whom the\
        \ distinctions which sophists hare drawn between the conventional extremes\
        \ of rirtue and vice before mentioned, were unknown \u2014 had a secret but\
        \ partially revealed to her father. And that was her lore \u2014 her sincere,\
        \ her tender lover for Eugene Archambault. Eugene was a youth of extraordinary\
        \ talent and surprising genius. There was scarcely a subject, however scientific,\
        \ however profound, however learned, on which lie could not only converse\
        \ with facility, but also witb judgment. He had read deeply, and retained\

        himself) rendered me every help in his power during my prolonged investigations
        at this building. Mr. Sutton, the Chief Librarian at the Manchester Free Libraries,
        and Mr. J. E. Bailey, F.S.A., have also been of the greatest service in aiding
        my inquiries. My earnest desire is that these pages may contribute in some
        degree to promote an interest in the study of the noble domestic architecture
        of earlier times. It is only from the general diffusion of such a study that
        we can hope for any arrest of the invasion of pretentiousness, flimsiness,
        weak and foolish construction, and crude ornamentation, which is fast ruining
        our ancient towns and villages, and rendering the face of the country repulsive
        to every person of cultivated taste. HENRY TAYLOR. 2, Saint Anne''s Churchyard,

        \ in the month of May, 1883, resolved that it would be desirable \"to print\
        \ the Addresses of the Chamberlains of the City to those on whom its Honorary\
        \ Freedom had been conferred, from the date of the Accession of King George\
        \ III., together with the Replies of the Recipients; and that the Work do\
        \ also include Addresses presented by the Court of Common Council to Foreign\
        \ Sovereigns and other distinguished persons, not receiving the Freedom, together\
        \ with their Replies thereto.\" In compliance with this Resolution, the Library\
        \ Committee of the Corporation \u2014 presided over successively by Mr. James\
        \ L. Shuter, F.R.A.S, the late Chairman, and Mr Henry Hodsoll Heath, J. P.,\
        \ the present Chairman \u2014 requested Mr. Benjamin Scott, the Chamberlain,\
        \ to undertake the collection of the necessary materials, in which work he\
        \ received the co-operation of Sir John Monckton the Town Clerk, and of Mr.\
        \ W. H. Overall the Librarian. The Committee entrusted the editing, printing,\
        \ and publishing of the Work, to Messrs. Cassell and Company. Upon consideration,\
        \ it has been thought desirable to ante-date by about three years the period\
        \ for commencing the returns, taking as a starting-point a very important\
        \ crisis in English History, when, in 1757, the Right Honorable William Pitt,\
        \ afterwards first Earl of Chatham, and the Right Honorable H. B. Legge, third\
        \ son of the Earl of Dartmouth, then lately Chancellor of the Exchequer, were\
        \ complimented by the presentation of the Freedom.1 Had the record been traced\
        \ a few years earlier it would have brought under review the closing effort\
        \ of the Stuart Dynasty to regain the English throne ; for in January, 1 745\
        \ \u2014 6, the Duke of Cumberland was conoratulated \" for his magnanimous\
        \ behaviour during the Rebellion in favour of the Pretender, and for his vigilant\

        \ paid to the philanthropic Earl of Shaftesbury, who, it is hoped, will attend\
        \ to receive his Freedom while these pages are passing through the press.\

        \ formed themselves into \" The General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland,\"\
        \ and chose Thomas Chalmers, D.D., as their moderator; so \" the bush burned,\

        \ meetings of the college, and another was an ante-chamber ; but the principal\
        \ apartment was the library \u2014 a room upwards of fifty feet long by thirty\
        \ broad, lighted by two rows of windows, five in each row, facing Rose Street,\
        \ and having a gilded gallery on three sides. On this edifice \xA34,800 was\
        \ spent. It was a remarkable instance of the emphatic assertion of religious\
        \ principle in an age of material things of which St. Andrew's church was\
        \ the scene on the 18th of May. It was no sacri fice of blood or life or limb\
        \ that was exacted, or rendered, as in the days of \" a broken cove nant ;\
        \ \" but it was one well calculated to excite the keenest emotions of the\
        \ people \u2014 for all these clergymen, with their families, cast their bread\
        \ upon the waters, and those who witnessed the dark pro cession that descended\
        \ the long steep street to wards Tanfield Hall never forgot it. In 1 781,\
        \ the library, which had been stored up in the Royal Infirmary, was removed\
        \ to the hall, when the collection, which now greatly exceeds 6,000 volumes,\
        \ was still comparatively in its infancy. Dr. Archibald Stevenson was the\
        \ first librarian, and was appointed in 1683; in 1696 a law was enacted that\
        \ every entrant should con tribute at least one book to the library, which\
        \ was increased in 1705 \"by the purchase of the books of the deceased Laird\
        \ of Livingstone for about 300 merks Scots;\" and the records show how year\
        \ by year the collection has gone on increasing in extent, and in literary\
        \ and scientific value. Opposite this church there was built the old Physicians'\
        \ Hall \u2014 the successor of the still more ancient one near the Cowgate\
        \ Port. The members of that college feued from the city a large area, extending\
        \ between the south side of George Street and Rose Street, on which they erected\
        \ a very handsome hall, with rooms and offices, from a design by Mr. Craig,\
        \ the architect of the new city itself. The two oldest names on the list of\
        \ Fellows admitted are Peter Kello, date December nth, 1682, and John Abernethy,\
        \ whose diploma is dated June 9th, 1683, granted at Orange, and admitted December\
        \ 4th, 1684, and a wonderful roll follows of names renowned in the annals\
        \ of medicine. The attempt to incorporate the prac titioners of medicine in\
        \ Scotland, for the purpose of raising alike the standard of their character\
        \ and acquirements, originated in 161 7, when James VI. issued an order in\
        \ Parliament for the establishment of a College of Physicians in Edinburgh\
        \ \u2014 an order which recites the evils suffered by the community from the\
        \ intrusion of unqualified practitioners. He further suggested that three\
        \ members of the pro posed college should yearly visit the apothecaries' shops,\
        \ and destroy all bad or insufficient drugs found therein ; but the year 1630\
        \ came, and found only a renewal of the proposal for a college, referred to\
        \ the Privy Council by Charles I. But the civil war followed, and nothing\
        \ more was done till 1656, when Cromwell issued a patent, still ex tant, initiating\
        \ a college of physicians in Scotland, with the powers proposed by James VI.\
        \ The foundation stone was laid by Professor Cullen, long a distinguished\
        \ ornament of the Edinburgh University, on the 27th November, 1775, after\
        \ a long discussion concerning two other sites offered by the city, one in\
        \ George Square, the other where now the Scott monument stands. In the stone\
        \ was placed a parchment containing the names of the then fellows, several\
        \ coins of 1771, and a large silver medal. There was also another silver medal,\

        \ best apparel accompanied by their parents. For many years the history of\
        \ the school is little more than a biographical list of the various masters\
        \ and teachers. A fifth class was established in 1 6 1 4 for the rudiments\
        \ of Greek during the rectorship of John Ray (the friend of Zachary Boyd),\
        \ who after being Professor of Humanity in the university for eight years,\
        \ regarded it promotion to leave it to take full charge of the High School\
        \ ; and when he died, in February, 1630, his office was again con ferred upon\
        \ a Professor of Humanity, Thomas Crawford, who figured prominently amid the\
        \ pageants with which Charles I. was welcomed to the city in 1633, and with\
        \ Hawthornden and others composed and delivered some of the bombastic speeches\
        \ on that occasion. The roll was then called over, and each boy presented\
        \ his offering. AA-Tien the latter was less than the quarterly fee no notice\
        \ was taken of it, but if it amounted to that sum the rector exclaimed with\

        \ against the levy of any \" Bleis-sylver, or Benl sylver,\" but apparently\
        \ in vain. The latter referred to the money for collecting bent, or rushes,\
        \ to lay down on the clay floor to keep the feet warm and dry ; and so lately\
        \ as the commencement of the seventeenth century, during the summer season,\
        \ the pupils had leave to go forth with hooks to cut bent by the margins of\
        \ Duddingston and the Burgh lochs, or elsewhere. \" Happily,\" says Steven,\
        \ of a later date, \" all exactions are now un known ; and at four regular\
        \ periods in the course of each session, the teachers receive from their pupils\
        \ a fixed fee, which is regarded as a fair remuneration for their professional\
        \ labour.'' In his time the number of pupils fluctuated greatly ; he complained\
        \ to the Council that though they had led him to expect \" 400 bairns at the\
        \ least,\" he had only 180 when he began office. But there is no authentic\
        \ record of attendance at that early period ; and it is curious that the abstract\
        \ of the annual enrolment of scholars goes no farther back than the Session\
        \ of 1738-9, while a general matri culation register was not commenced till\
        \ 1827. In December, 1640, Crawford returned to the university, and was succeeded\
        \ by AVilliam Spence, schoolmaster of Prestonpans ; but to give all the successive\
        \ masters of the institution would far exceed our space. The masters and scholars\
        \ had very indifferent accommodation during the invasion of Cromwell after\
        \ Dunbar. His troops made a barrack of the school-house, and while there broke\
        \ and burned all the woodwork, leaving it in such a state of ruin that the\
        \ pupils had to meet in Lady Yester's Church till it was repaired by funds\
        \ drawn from the masters of the Trinity Hospital at the foot of Leith AVynd.\
        \ In those days the pupils attended divine service, accompanied by their masters,\
        \ and were frequently catechised before the congregation. A part of Lady Yester's\
        \ Church, was set apart for their use, and afterwards the eastern gallery\
        \ of the Trinity College church. In 1680, the Privy Council issued a proclamation\
        \ prohibiting all private Latin schools to be opened within the city or suburbs,\
        \ and thus the High School enjoyed an almost undisturbed monopoly ; and sixteen\
        \ years after, in the proceedings of the Town Council, we find the following\
        \ enactment : \u2014 A library for the benefit of the institution was added\
        \ to it in 1658, and it now consists of many thousand volumes. Among the first\
        \ donors of books were John Muir the rector, all the masters, Patrick Scott\
        \ of Thirlstane, and John Lord Swinton of that ilk. Afterwards it was sup\
        \ ported by the appropriation of one half of the matriculation fund to its\
        \ use, and every way it is a valuable classical, historical, geographical,\
        \ and antiquarian collection. The rector and masters, with the assistance\
        \ of the janitor, discharge in rotation the duties of librarian. \"\u25A0\

        \ great bibliopole, David Laing, so many years Librarian of the Signet Library,\
        \ at his own expense. An essential feature in the memorial is a head of Buchanan\
        \ in bronze, from the best likeness of him extant. The design was furnished\
        \ by D. W. Stevenson, A.R.S.A. Near it is the somewhat remarkable tomb of\

        \ The popular story is that the lady was poisoned by her four daughters, whose\
        \ statues were placed over her in eternal remem brance of their wickedness\

        \ favourite emblematical characters in that age when the monument was erected;\
        \ and the object in placing them there was merely ornamental. Taking some\
        \ of the interments at random, here is the grave of George Heriot (father\

        \ library to the University, and the gift is deemed a valuable one, from the\
        \ rare specimens of our early litera ture which enrich the collection. Among\
        \ the chief donors whose gifts are extensive and valuable may be named Principal\
        \ Adamson, Dr. Robert Johnston, the Rev. James Nairne of Wemyss, Dr. John\
        \ Stevenson, who held the chair of Logic and Metaphysics from 1730 till 1774,\
        \ Dr. William Thomson, Professor of Anatomy at Oxford ; and in 1872 the library\
        \ received a very valuable donation from J. O. Halliwell, the eminent Shaks\
        \ perian critic, a collection of works relating to -Shakspere, and formed\
        \ by him at great cost. successors in office, for the purpose of demon strating\
        \ and explaining the structure, physiology, and diseases of the human body.\"\
        \ In 1859 Sir David Monro, M.D., presented a considerable collection of anatomical\
        \ preparations, formed by his talented father, Dr. Alexander Monro tertius.\
        \ Many valuable additions have been made since then ; among them, some by\
        \ the late John Goodsir, Professor of Anatomy, 1846-1867, more especially\
        \ in the comparative department ; and since his death the Senatus purchased\
        \ from his representatives his private museum and added it to the collection,\
        \ which now contains many thou sand specimens illustrative of human anatomy,\
        \ both normal and pathological, and of comparative anatomy. The average collection\
        \ of the university extends to about 150,000 volumes, and 700 volumes of MSS.\
        \ The university possesses above seventy -valuable portraits and busts of\
        \ ancient and modern alumni, most of which are kept in the Senate Hall and\
        \ library. The latter possesses a fine copy of Fordun's Scotichronicon (on\
        \ vellum) in folio, from \u25A0which Goodall's edition of 1775 was printed.\
        \ There are minor museums in connection with the classes of natural philosophy,\
        \ midwifery, ma teria medica and botany, and one was recently con structed\
        \ by Professor Geikie for the use of the geological class. In October, 1881,\
        \ nearly the whole of the great anatomical collection referred to here, including\
        \ the skeletons of the infamous Burke and one of his victims known as \" Daft\
        \ Jamie,\" was removed from the old to the new University buildings at Lauriston.\
        \ The Museum of Natural History was established in 181 2, in connection with\
        \ the university, and contains a most valuable zoological, geological, and\
        \ mineralogical collection, the greater portion of which was formed by the\
        \ exertions of Professor Robert Jamieson, who was fifty years Professor of\
        \ Natural History (from 1804 to 1854) and Regius keeper of the museum. In\
        \ 1854 it was transferred by the Town Council (at that time patrons of the\
        \ university) to Government, under whose control it has since remained. The\
        \ whole of the collections have been now removed to the Natural History department\
        \ of the adjoining museum of Science and Art ; but are available for the educational\
        \ pur poses of the university, and are freely accessible to the students of\
        \ the natural history class. References to the Plan on Page 21. A, Entrance;\

        \ The Humanity Class, as a separate professoi ship, was founded by the Faculty\
        \ of Advocates, who, on being voted a sum of money for the endow ment of a\
        \ chair connected with their own profession, devoted it in the first instance\
        \ to the cultivation of Latin, as the language in which the most valuable\
        \ legal knowledge was to be found ; and John Ray was the first professor,\
        \ in 1597. On the 5th of May, 1703, the magistrates, flushed with triumph,\
        \ ordained that Mr. Scott's class should be publicly graduated, as of old,\
        \ in the public hall of the university, which was accordingly done, without\
        \ consulting that professor or any other member of the Senatus Academicus.\
        \ A memorial, however, signed by the former and the other professors, so far\
        \ succeeded in soothing the irate Provost and bailies, that they ultimately\
        \ granted him that which he had so earnestly wished \u2014 a private graduation\
        \ of his students ; but while doing so, they took the opportunity of loftily\
        \ and sternly prohibiting the other professors, \"upon their peril, to graduate\
        \ any in time coming but such as took out a certificate or diploma with the\
        \ town's seal, and poor scholars to have it gratis; and order that all certificates\
        \ make honourable men tion of the magistrates and Council of Edinburgh as\
        \ Patrons of the Colleges In 1707, on the Treaty of Union with England, there\
        \ was ratified by Parliament and in the Act of Security an Act of 162 1, by\
        \ which the Scottish Parliament defined in ample form the rights, immunities,\
        \ and privileges of the university. It was not until 1708 that a separate\
        \ professor ship of Greek was appointed. For some twenty years before that\
        \ period the proposal to that effect had been made, and a master actually\
        \ named, who was to teach within the college, without the rank or salary of\
        \ professor. But in the year above named, on the 16th of June, the Town Council,\
        \ \"considering that as a knowledge of the Greek tongue is a valuable piece\
        \ of learning, and much esteemed in all parts of the world where letters and\
        \ science do flourish, so they, being willing to con tribute their utmost\
        \ endeavour to advance the knowledge of that language, do judge that nothing\
        \ can more effectually promote the said end than the fixing of a Professor\
        \ of Greek in this burgh.\" Consequently, William Scott, one of the regents,\
        \ was appointed. Some curious matters of detail occurred about this time,\
        \ when the Rev. William Carstares was principal, in connection with the museum\
        \ of \" Rarities belonging to the College,\" on the state of which the Council\
        \ appointed a commission to report how far the said \" rarities \" 'in the\
        \ drawers corresponded to the inventory thereof. Among other things, the commission\
        \ reported that the wire-work in the presses was so wide that students and\
        \ others visiting the museum, \" by putting their fingers into the holes,\
        \ did disorder (the contents), and possibly might embezzle, some of them ;\
        \ particularly there was wanting a coraline substance growing upon a piece\
        \ of silver, much like unto a Spanish cob.\" Following Bower's \" History,\"\
        \ we may give the following condensed view of the course of study which was\
        \ introduced by Principal Rollock in I583* In the beginning of October the\
        \ session com menced, and lasted till about the end of the ensu ing August,\
        \ when an examination of the students took place before the Town Council and\
        \ the senior members of the college. As the younger men were prepared for\
        \ the perusal of the higher order of Latin Classics, the most of their time\
        \ was passed in read ing the most approved Roman authors, particularly Cicero,\
        \ who in those days was in the greatest repute among the learned. To remedy\
        \ these mischances it was proposed that the wires should be more close. Of\
        \ two cabinets they found that one contained the Materia Medica in three drawers\
        \ ; and as to the other, they knew not what was in it, as it had no keys,\
        \ and they had never seen it opened. The commission offered the further suggestion\
        \ that \" the Rarities purchased in the time of Mr. Henderson's father, such\
        \ as the woman's horn set with silver, and the skeleton, &c, be registrated\
        \ and catalogued by themselves.\" Translations from English into Latin, and\
        \ vice versa, were a regular exercise throughout the whole session, and the\
        \ \" common theme,\" as it was called, was prescribed by the principal towards\
        \ its close \u2014 i.e., the subject of a brief essay to be written in pure\
        \ Latin, affording each student an opportunity of displaying his attainments\
        \ in that language, and knowledge of the general principles of composition.\
        \ The keyless cabinet was ordered to be broken open, and found to contain\

        Voyages.) p. 137. Oldys (having given a list of the contents ofthe three volumes
        of Hakluyt) concludes, This summary may sufficiently intimate what a treasury
        of maritime knowledge it is ; wherefore we shall here take our leave of it,
        with referring only to a needful observation or two : And first, As it has
        been so useful to many of our authors, not only in Cosmography, and Navigation,
        but in History, especially that of the glorious reign in which so many brave
        exploits were atchieved : As it has been such a leading Star to the Naval
        Histories since compiled ; and saved from the wreck of oblivion many exemplary
        incidents in the lives of our most renowned navigators ; it has therefore
        been unworthily omitted in the English historical library. And lastly, though
        the first volume of this collection, does frequently appear, by the date,
        in the title page, to be printed in 1599, the reader is not thence to conclude
        the said volume was then reprinted, but only the title page, as upon collating
        the books we have observed ; and further, that in the said last printed title
        page, there is no mention made of the Cadiz Voyage ; to omit which, might
        be one reason of reprinting that page ; for it being one of the most prosperous
        and honourable enterprizes that ever the Earl of Essex was ingaged in, and
        he falling into the Queen''s unpardonable dis pleasure at this time, our author,
        Mr. Hakluyt, might probably receive command or direction, even from one of
        the patrons to whom these Voyages are dedicated, who was of the contrary faction,
        not only to suppress all memorial of that action in the front of this book,
        but even cancel the whole narrative thereof at the end of it, in all the copies
        (far the greatest part of the impression) which remained unpublished. And
        in that castrated manner the volume has descended to posterity ; not but if
        the castration was intended to have been concealed from us, the last leaf
        of the preface would have been reprinted also, with the like omission of what
        is there mentioned concerning the insertion of this Voyage. But at last, about
        the middle of the late King''s reign, an uncastrated copy did arise, and the
        said Voyage was reprinted from it ; whereby many imperfect books have been
        made complete.', 1]

        \ log school-house. In the year 1832, Rev. Jesse Walker was appointed to the\
        \ Chicago mission to suc ceed Mr. Beggs. As soon as practicable he moved to\
        \ Chicago, and entered upon his labors. His first quar terly meeting was held\
        \ in a log building, subsequently known as \" Father Walker's \" log cabin.\
        \ It stood on the West Side, near the bank of the river where the North and\
        \ South- branches meet, near what is now the southwest corner of Kinzie and\
        \ Canal streets. This building was used by Mr. Walker as a parsonage, par\
        \ lor, kitchen and church. At his first quarterly meeting, held in the fall\
        \ of 1833, there were present, besides him self, Rev. John Sinclair, presiding\
        \ elder, Rev. William See, local elder, Henry Whitehead, who was licensed\
        \ to preach at that meeting, Charles Wisencraft, Mrs. R. J. Hamilton, and\
        \ Mrs. Harmon. Mr. Whitehead was the first minister licensed in Chicago to\
        \ preach. Mr. Walker became superannuated in 1834 and died in 1835. Aside\
        \ from the religious services outlined above, and in connection with a debating\
        \ society, a religious meeting was held generally once a week at the house\
        \ of Mark Noble, Sr., who had arrived in Chicago in Au gust, 1831, and moved\
        \ into the old cabin of the Kin zies'. These meetings were held to provide\
        \ for those who had no taste for literary matters and dancing then indulged\
        \ in at Fort Dearborn, and were the first prayer meetings in Chicago. In conducting\
        \ them Mr. Noble was assisted by his wife and two daughters, and Mrs. R. J.\
        \ Hamilton, all of them being members of the Method ist Episcopal Church.\
        \ Mrs. Hamilton contributed very largely to the interest and success of the\
        \ meetings, be ing a lady of great intelligence, comprehensive views and devoted\
        \ piety. She was for many years among the first in all religious and benevolent\
        \ enterprises, and furnished the first pulpit in Chicago with necessary articles.\
        \ Mr. Noble also, was very zealous in his piety, and was the principal speaker\
        \ at these meetings. He was a man of large experience, and of great practical\
        \ common sense. Thus it will be seen that the Method ists, when continued\
        \ effort is considered, were the pioneers in Christian work, though they did\
        \ not have the first completely organized society, nor erect the first church\
        \ edifice. but as there were only thirteen children in the school, each scholar\
        \ and teacher could have a book. John S. Wright acted as secretary and librarian,\
        \ and was ac customed to carry the library to and from the temporary place\
        \ of meeting in his pocket handkerchief. The pov erty of the library in volumes\
        \ was observed by two gentlemen from New York, Charles Butler and Arthur Bronson,\
        \ visiting in Chicago, who upon their return home sent two hundred volumes\
        \ as a donation. Having thus traced the religious movements of Chi cago from\
        \ the time of the noble and self-sacrificing Jacques Marquette, in 1673, down\
        \ to that of the equally zealous and laborious \"Pathfinder,\" Rev. Jesse\
        \ Walker, in 1833, it will now be our province to trace, with such accuracy\
        \ as we may, and with such minuteness as is compatible with the design of\
        \ this work, the particular history of each individual church organization\
        \ that has been or is now within the limits of Chicago. They are given as\
        \ nearly as practicable in the chronological order of their organization.\
        \ CATHOLICISM. In 1833, the first year in which regular church or ganizations\
        \ existed in Chicago, three churches were formed \u2014 a Catholic, a Presbyterian\
        \ and a Baptist, in the order named; the first in May, the second in June,\
        \ and the third in October. St. Mary's Church. \u2014 This was the first Catholic\
        \ society organized in Chicago. Its first priest was Father John Mary Irenaeus\
        \ St. Cyr, who was born at Lyons, F'rance, November 2, 1803, and educatea\
        \ in that coun try. He left France in June, 1831, reached St. Louis August\
        \ 1, of the same year, and was there made a sub deacon. He was ordained at\
        \ St. Mary's the Barrens by Bishop Rosatti in 1832, and on April 6, 1833,\
        \ was by the same Bishop ordained priest. The period be tween these two dates\
        \ was spent by St. Cyr in studying the English language. In the meantime Catholics\
        \ were increasing in numbers in Chicago, and were becoming desirous of receiving\
        \ the ministrations of a resident Catholic priest. To accomplish their desires\
        \ they pre pared and forwarded to St. Louis the following petition: \" To\
        \ the Right Rev. Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Mis souri, of St. Louis,\
        \ etc., etc. \" We, the Catholics of Chicago, Cook Co., 111., lay before you\
        \ the necessity there exists to have a pastor in this new and flourishing\
        \ city. There are here several families of French de scent, born and brought\
        \ up in the Roman Catholic faith, and others quite willing to aid us in supporting\
        \ a pastor, who ought to be sent here before other sects obtain the upper\
        \ hand, which very likely they will try to do. We have heard several persons\
        \ say were there a priest here thev would join our religion in preference\
        \ to any other. We count about one hundred Catholics in this town. We will\
        \ not cease to pray until you have taken our important request in consideration.\"\
        \ In addition to the efforts made to improve the re ligious characters of\
        \ adults, the moral and religious training of the children was not neglected.\
        \ A Sunday school, the first in Chicago, was organized on the 19th of August,\
        \ 1832, by Luther Childs, Mrs. Seth Johnson, Mrs. Charles Taylor, the Misses\
        \ Noble and Philo Car penter. The school first assembled in a small frame\
        \ building then lately erected on the Reservation, near Mr. Noble's house,\
        \ by Mark Beaubien. At this time the building was not completed; it had a\
        \ floor, was sided up, and had on some of the roof-boards, but it was not\
        \ shingled and had neither windows nor doors. The school afterward met in\
        \ the fort, at the house of Rufus Brown, at Rev. Jesse Walker's cabin, and\

    - ['HISTORY OF THE PRESS. 365 Chicago, that Mr. Calhoun decided upon removing
        to this place. On the 21st of September, 1833, he pro ceeded by the most expeditious
        route to Chicago, which then was by steamboat from Buffalo to Detroit, and
        thence by stage. The steamer upon which he took passage encountered a terrific
        gale on Lake Erie, and was, after being twice driven back, at last headed
        for Black River harbor, where she stuck upon 11 bar which had formed ;it its
        mouth. Her floatage being a matter of uncertainty, Mr. Calhoun, in company
        with other passengers, debarked and went on foot to Huron, a distance of about
        twenty miles. Af ter remaining there two days, a schooner was char tered to
        convey the party to Detroit. From that place the journey was continued by
        stage, across Mich igan and Indiana, by the slow conveyances of the period.
        The printing materials were safely bestowed on New berry & Dole''s log dock,
        when Mr. Calhoun arrived ; the freight having come by way of the lakes, on
        a sail ing vessel. Three weeks'' time was consumed in the voyage from Sackett''s
        Harbor, and the same period was required to reach this place by land. Two
        appren tices, whose names are not now remembered, had evi dently accompanied
        the materials from the East ; for Mr. Calhoun, in the autobiography, writes
        of finding them at the "Travellers'' Home," then kept by C. In gersoll, on
        Wolf Point. An office was secured in 21 building on the southwest corner of
        South Water and Clark streets, which was unfinished at the time. Mr. Calhoun
        assisted in the work of lathing the room, and, during the evenings, held a
        light by which Ashbel Steele could see to lay on the rough plaster. Mr. Calhoun
        was an ardent admirer of Andrew Jackson, and a pronounced Democrat of the
        school which claimed that sturdy soldier as their pattern. The proposed paper
        was, therefore, named the Chicago Democrat. On the 26th day of November, 1833,
        the first issue appeared. It was a six-column folio, measur ing twenty by
        fifty inches in size. Its motto was, "Where Liberty dwells, there is my country."
        Mr. Calhoun was not possessed of great wealth, and feelingly writes of his
        financial embarrassments during those days of struggle. He expresses himself
        under obligation to T. J. V. Owen for substantial encourage ment. As an evidence
        of the meager support then ob tainable, the appended list of subscribers to
        the Demo crat, taken from the original book, tells a story which newspaper

        Calhoun demonstrated the platform the paper would occupy under his manage
        ment in a clear manner, announcing his faith in the principles of the Democratic
        party, unbiased by preju dice. The importance of the contemplated canal or
        railroad between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River was appreciated,
        and the paper was pledged to favor the enterprise. As a local index, a list

        \ first opera season in Chicago was inaugurated unuer what were far from flat-\
        \ tering auspices, and its duration was confined to a very small part of a\
        \ single evening's entertainment. On the evening of July 30, 1850, an opera\
        \ company consisting of Mr. Manvers, Mr.Guibelei, Mr. Lippert and Miss Brienti,\
        \ assisted by a home-chorus and orchestra, began the first season of opera\
        \ ever given, or rather ever attempted, in this city. The piece for the opening\
        \ night was \" Son- nambula,\" and the place of presentation Rice's first\
        \ theater, located on Randolph Street. A fair audience was present to witness\
        \ this initial performance and everything had progressed smoothly until the\
        \ rising of the curtain on the second act. At this juncture the alarm of fire\
        \ was given, and in an hour's time, the thea- ter in which the opera was progressing\
        \ lay in ashes, in- volving a loss to its owners of over $4,000.* Thus ab-\
        \ ruptly terminated, before it had even fairly begun, the first opera season\
        \ in Chicago. Undaunted by his ill- fortunes, Mr. Rice soon purchased a lot\
        \ on Dear- born Street, and immediately began the erection of a new theater.\
        \ From this time until in October, 1853, no operas were given. The second\
        \ season of this class of entertainments began in Rice's new theater on the\
        \ 27th of October, 1853, and lasted one week. The company was the Italian\
        \ Opera Troupe from New York. In the Democratic Press preceding the opening\
        \ of the season the following card from the manager of the troupe is found\
        \ : \" The undersigned, acting in the name and in behalf of Ma- dame De Vries\
        \ and Signor L'Arditi, known by the name and style of the Artists' Association,\
        \ has the honor of calling the attention of the musical community and of the\
        \ citizens of Chicago in general, to the fact that he has made arrangements\
        \ with Mr. Rice, the man- ager, to have the Italian Opera Troupe on Thursday\
        \ evening, Octo- ber 27, at the Chicago Theater, to perform the opera, in\
        \ three acts of \"Lucia di Lammermoor.\" The undersigned begs leave to intro-\
        \ duce the following artists : The grand prima donna, Signorina R. De Vries,\
        \ the favorite tenor, Signor Pozzolini, the tenor Signor Arnoldi, the comprimaria,\
        \ Mme. Sidenbourg, late of Madame Al- bani's troupe, the unrivaled baritone,\
        \ Signor Taffenelli, and the eminent basso, Signor Calletti. Also a grand\
        \ and efficient chorus, and grand orchestra. This great company numbers over\
        \ forty members, the whole under the most able direction of the distin- guished\
        \ maestro, Signor L'Arditti. C. POGLIANI. The leading characters in the opera\
        \ were cast as fol- lows : Lucia Signora R. De Vries. Elgardo Signor Pozzolini.\
        \ Lord Asthoro Signor Taffanelli. Lord Aurthur Bouchsland Signor Barattini.\

        \ and were well received by both press and public. Among the musical events\
        \ for the year 1853, none equaled in importance the coming of those justly\
        \ cele- brated characters in the musical world, Adelina Patti and Ole Bull.\
        \ These famous artists made each their first appearance in this city, at Tremont\
        \ Music Hall, April 21, of that year. The season of this company consisted\
        \ of three concerts given April 21, 23, and 26. The appended programme of\
        \ the opening night illus trates the excellent character of the entertainments.\

        \ to these concerts were one and two dollars, and with each one was given\
        \ a certificate, bearing the number corresponding to the ticket. These certificates\
        \ were to remain in the hands of the original holders, and established their\
        \ ownership to their seats. In May following, Ole Bull and his company returned\
        \ and gave a concert in the same hall, for the benefit of the Norwegian Lutheran\
        \ Church ; the affair was a success, netting five hundred dollars to the beneficiary.\
        \ On the 1 8th of June, an excellent home concert was given at WTarner's Hall\

        \ prima donna, assisted by Mrs. Amelia Patti Strakosch, and the wonderful\
        \ boy violinist, Paul Julien, appeared at Tremont Hall two nights, June 29\
        \ and 30. In November was announced the revival of the sub- scription concerts\
        \ of the Philharmonic Society, under the direction of Christoper Plagge. In\
        \ that month the New York Italian Opera Company returned, singing this time\
        \ only in operatic selections. On the last night of their stay they gave a\
        \ \" grand sacred concert.\" Early in March, 1854, the Blakey family appeared\
        \ at Tremont Hall, and on the 21st, 23d and 25th of the month Ole Bull and\
        \ Adelina Patti gave a series of their popular performances at the same place.\
        \ In May the Philhar- monic Society held its yearly meeting for the election\
        \ of officers. Charles N. Holden was re-chosen as presi- dent; the other officers\
        \ were A. D. Tittsworth, vice- president; R. G. Green, treasurer; and I. D.\

        \ C. H. Lawrens, J. Q. Thomp- son, A. D. Tittsworth, J. T. Jewett, C. 0. Thompson\
        \ and W. H. Rice. This organization was at this time in a flourishing condition,\
        \ having in January and February of this year given a series of concerts which,\
        \ aside from being popular and pleasing entertainments, had netted it handsome\

    - ['MECHANICS'' INSTITUTE. 519 throughout the mechanical classes ; to found lectures
        on natural, mechanical, and chemical philosophy and other scientific subjects
        ; to create a library and museum for the benefit of mechanics and others ;
        and to estab lish schools for the benefit of their youth, and to estab lish
        annual fairs." The constitution further provided that the institution might
        consist of an unlimited num ber of members, divided into three classes, regular
        or life members, honorary, and corresponding members. The only requisite for
        membership was good moral character in the applicant, who was to be proposed
        by one or more members of the Institute, and who was required to receive a
        majority of the votes cast relative to admission, and to pay the initiative
        fee demanded under its by-laws. The officers were chosen annually and regular
        meetings were held on the first Tuesday evening of each month. Recognizing
        early the impor tance of obtaining a library, the leading members of the Institute
        set vigorously to work to accomplish this much desired end. Indeed, so enthusiastic
        were they on this subject, that it was unanimously voted to make no attempt
        to hold a mechanical fair until at least the foundation was laid for the establishment
        of such a library as the Institute desired. With the incorporation of the
        Institute, the Prarie Farmer, then the best agri cultural monthly in the West,
        was made its offickil organ, and the mechanical department of the paper was
        edited by John Gage, a prominent and active member, who was as thorough and
        able an editor as he was a skilled and practical mechanic. Especially did
        he bend his energies to the acquirement of the library ; not an issue of the
        Prairie Farmer in which he did not discuss its importance and urge the members
        of the Institute to united and vigorous measures for its speedy accom plishment.
        In accordance with his suggestions, the Institute, on the 2 2d of March, adopted
        a proposition to raise subscriptions for this purpose, to be paid in July
        following. This meeting, though not largely attended, was a very enthusiastic
        one, and $128 were subscribed and paid on the spot. Mr. Gage published this
        in the Prairie Farmer and said that if each of the one hundred and fifty members
        would subscribe five dollars each, the net sum thus obtained would furnish
        money sufficient to purchase books enough to form quite a respectable library.
        Isaac Speer, J. B. Weir, G. F. Foster, C. M. Gray, A. F. Bradley and John
        Gage were appointed a committee to solicit subscriptions. They went to work
        with a will, and with such success that by December, six hundred and twenty
        new volumes were purchased and placed in the library-room, swell ing the number
        of books thus acquired in the first year to nearly one thousand standard works.
        About this time arrangements were made by which lectures were delivered before
        the Institute, by local as well as traveling lecturers. Speaking of this subject,
        the Prairie Farmer says: "Whenever a traveling lecturer comes along, if he
        be an able one and promises an interesting course, an arrangement is made
        by which he is furnished with their room, lights, etc., and the mem bers of
        the Institute admitted free, other citizens pay ing what the lecturer may
        demand." At the close of the year 1843, President Miltimore, on yielding up
        his office to his newly elected successor, delivered an ad dress in which
        he briefly reviewed the history of the Institute, and congratulated the members
        on the unin terrupted prosperity which had attended the first year of its
        corporate existence. At the election of officers for the year 1844, the following
        gentlemen were select ed: G. F. Foster, president; William H. Kennicott, first
        vice-president; Azel Peck, second vice-president; Isaac Speer, corresponding
        secretary; Elijah Smith, treasurer; G. M. Gray, librarian; I. L. Milliken,
        William Blair, H. Barney, S. S. Foster, A. F. Bradley, and J. E. Brown, directors.
        The Institute was now fairly on the way to success and had already established
        its claims on the public as an institution meriting its hearty support. Jn
        the following year (1845) the first annual fair under its auspices was held,
        and was a suc cess beyond the hopes of the most sanguine of its pro jectors.
        No records are at hand to give any details of the exhibits of this fair, more
        than to say in a general way that a large number of mechanical models were
        contributed, man)'' of them being furnished by mechan ics in this city. The
        fair, too, proved a stimulus to the Institute, for during the year it rapidly
        increased in membership; its course of lectures attracted always good audiences
        and proved a source of considerable revenue; the library was enriched with
        the addition of many new and standard works, and the reading-room was enlarged
        and comfortably fitted up for the accom modation of its visitors. In January
        of that year the annual election of officers was held, and resulted as follows:
        S. D. Childs, president; H. L. Fulton, first vice-president; Jason Gurley,
        second vice-president; W. Blair, treasurer; S. S. Foster, recording secretary;
        Zebina Eastman, corresponding secretary; J. G. Brown, librarian. The directors
        for this year were: C. M. Gray, I. Speer, J. Meeker, I. L. Milliken, A. Bent
        and S. Johnson. Two years now elapsed, of the events of which it has been
        found impossible to obtain any record, and no information except that which
        may be gleaned, or rather inferred from later years. In a gen eral way it
        can be said they were prosperous and happy years for the Institute. This much
        is deduced from a statement made by a member who, in writing a brief sketch
        of it, says: "Until the year 1857 the prosperity of the society continually
        increased. In January, 1848, an election of officers was held, and Azel Peck,
        a prom inent member of the society and later its benefactor, was chosen its
        president. The other officers were: S. J. Lowe and S. S. Foster, vice-presidents;
        J. E. Wheeler, corresponding secretary; O. Jagger, librarian; Isaac Speer,
        treasurer; Sanford Johnson, C. M. Gray, Peter Graff, H. H. Husted, A. D. Gibbons,
        and G. R. Sloat, directors. The regular meetings were still held in the Saloon
        Building, on the first Tuesday evening in each month. During 1848 the lecture
        course of the Institute was the best yet given, consisting of lectures on
        the arts and sciences, and delivered by the best informed and most scientific
        men in the city, who pre pared them for the special benefit of the members
        of the Institute, more than for the edification of the gen eral public. Although
        the regular meetings of the so ciety were held but monthly, the library was
        kept con stantly open to its members, each of whom was entitled to draw from
        it one book at a time, to be retained not longer than one week without renewal.
        The officers for 1849 were: Edward Burling, president; Robert Foss and R.
        Shephard, vice-presidents; A. D. Taylor, recording secretary; George Davis,
        corresponding sec retary; and I. Speer, treasurer. The directors were: H.
        H. Husted, I. L. Milliken, P. L. Updike, W. Anderson, P. W. Gates, and Ives
        Scoville; lilbrarian, Oliver Jagger. In November of the following year the
        question of establishing an evening school for the benefit of ap prentices
        and the sons of members, was discussed, and at a meeting of the board of directors
        held on the 19th of the month, it was determined to start such a school. A
        call was issued for competent persons who were will-', 3]
    - ['HISTORY OF CHICAGO. 520 fication of knowing that its last art and mechanical
        fair had been the means of calling out a display of exhibits, the like of
        which had never been equaled by any society in the West. The officers elected
        for 1854 were Peter Graff, president; James F. Jillson and E. Granger, vice-presi
        dents; Louis Dodge and George P. Hansen, secretaries; Isaac Speer, treasurer,
        and Louis Dodge, librarian. Directors : Stephen Derr, Ives Scoville, E. McAuthur,
        S. D. Childs and Noble Martin. In 1855 the Institute had reached that point
        in its history where its importance was recognized in a most flattering and
        sustantial manner, both by the State and Nation. Congress passed an act providing
        that the scientific reports and books of the Smithsonian Institute should
        be printed and distributed to the three most important institutions in the
        country The Chicago Mechanics '' Institute was included among the three, and
        received its due share. At this time the State Executive Committee on Agriculture
        at Spring field authorized the Institute to hold and conduct an agricultural
        and mechanical fair in this city. This it did in the fall of 1855, being the
        first general agricultural and mechanical fair ever held in the State of Illinois.
        The officers then were : C. T. Boggs, president; Will iam Price and Ives Scoville,
        vice-presidents; C. E. Holmes and H. M. Zimmerman, secretaries; Isaac Speer,
        treasurer, and E. C. Holmes, librarian. The directors were E. Granger, L.
        Waterhouse, S. D. Childs, I. L. Milliken, N. Mason and H. W. Zimmerman. In
        1856 the officers of the Institute began making extensive arrangements for
        enlarging its quarters, extending the library, and also providing a suitable
        place in which to hold its annual fairs. In doing this they were simply carrying
        out the privileges granted in their charter, which gave them the right to
        establish a perma nent public library, a thing which the committee had now
        determined to do. They therefore divided the library into two departments,
        one for circulation, the other for reference. In the circulating department
        there were now over two thousand volumes, embracing the best works in all
        departments of miscellaneous liter ature, while in the reference library were
        fifteen hun dred volumes, including permanent and valuable pub lications in
        every branch of knowledge. An official catalogue of the books in both libraries
        was also pre pared. The committee issued an address to the public, from which
        is taken the following extract: ing to teach to send in their names to the
        board at once. It was also decided to devote four evenings of the week to
        the school and one to the lectures. The experiment proved from the start a
        success ; and the night-school was regularly maintained for years. The rate
        of tuition was but trifling, hence the sessions were attended and the school,
        as an educator, became a. recognized power in the community. In this year
        Hon. William Bross delivered before the society a course of interesting and
        instructive lectures on geology. Dr. Blaney also lect ured on various occasions
        on " Chemistry as applied to the'' Arts." It was during this year, too, that
        the Smith sonian Institute at Washington donated copies of its own publications
        to the society. Dr. J. E. McGirr, a then prominent physician of Chicago, also
        delivered a series of lectures on physiology and hygiene for the espe cial
        benefit of the young students at the night-school. The officials for this
        year were William H. Kennicott, president ; I. Speer, vice-president and treasurer
        ; A. D. Taylor, recording secretary and librarian ; Alfred Dutch, corresponding
        secretary. The directors were S. D. Childs, William Bross, O. P. Hathaway,
        J. V. A. Wemple, Edward Burling and G. R. Sloat. At the beginning of 185 1
        the annual election of officers was again held and H. H. Husted chosen president
        ; A Bent and J. Couthbel, vice-presidents ; A. D. Taylor and G. R. Sloat,
        secretaries ; Isaac Speer, treasurer ; A. D. Taylor, librarian. The directors
        were H. L. Fulton, A. C/Wood, Edward Burling, Henry Colson, Elihu Granger
        and S. T. Hinckley. This year little is to be noted except the continued growth
        and prosperity of the society, and that in the winter its lecture course was
        better than ever before in its history, being sup plied with the most celebrated
        lecturers then before the public. The annual fair held in October, 185 1,
        was a marked success. The officers elected in 1852 were G. R. Sloat, president
        ; W. H. Kennicott and George W. Snow, vice-presidents ; A. D. Taylor, recording
        sec retary and librarian ; S. D. Childs, corresponding secretary ; and Isaac
        Speer, treasurer. The directors were H. L. Fulton, J. A. Kennicott, Peter
        Page, James Curtiss, Allen Vane and F. E. Demiry. About this time a change
        was made in the constitution of the society, by which citizens other than
        mechanics were admitted to its privileges. This had the effect to greatly
        increase its prosperity, as well as to extend its influence and widen its
        field of usefulness. Its library numbered over two thousand choice volumes
        and was open to the public, as well as to the members of the Institute, the
        year round. "Our city and country are so rapidly filling up with new cit izens
        that it could not be expected that the public should be fully advised of the
        value of every institution which has been prepared in advance for their good.
        Therefore we invite the mechanics of Chicago, and the public generally, to
        visit our hall, attend our meetings, and avail themselves of the library,
        lectures, and privi leges which this institute may be able to confer." With
        the opening of the year 1853, the Institute doubtless had reached the zenith
        of its prosperous and highly useful career; it had nearly three hundred mem
        bers, a library of over two thousand volumes, and the best winter lecture
        course given before any association or society in the land. This year Hon.
        John Went worth made donation to the society of a great number of books and
        an extensive collection of important public documents. Beginning on the first
        Tuesday in Novem ber was held its sixth annual fair at the city hall. This
        was among the best and most important in its character of any that had been
        conducted. The Institute during 1856 held regular weekly meet ings for the
        exhibition of any new invention, natural curiosity, chemical compounds, or
        rare specimens of art. To these meetings strangers and visitors in the city
        were cordially invited; and in any event they were always well attended. The
        officers for 1856 were George P. Hansen, pres ident; Isaac Speer and I. L.
        Milliken, vice-presidents; LTrich Gregory and Z. Eastman, secretaries; U.
        Gregory, librarian, and Isaac Speer, treasurer. The directors were N. S. Cushing,
        Z. Eastman, S. D. Childs, U. Gregory, Lewis Dodge and R. E. Moss. With the
        beginning of the year 1857, and at which period its his tory in this volume
        must be closed, the Institute had never seen brighter days, nor had it ever
        had rosier prospects for the future. But clouds were gathering, which, although

        \ hundred vol umes, contributed by friends; but in 185 1, this number was\
        \ increased to over twenty-five hundred, and by the spring of 1857 to four\
        \ thousand seven hundred and fifty, embracing works from standard authors\
        \ in liter ature, fiction, travel, art, science, history, and biography, making\
        \ a valuable library, the benefit of which to its patrons can hardly be overestimated.\
        \ In fact, at this stage of its existence, its growing value and importance\
        \ were fully recognized, and it was already regarded as one of the indispensable\
        \ institutions of the city. Here, for the present, it is necessary to close\
        \ the account of its further growth and works, to be again taken up and carried\
        \ along in proper time and order in the second volume of this work. \" The\
        \ old cemetery was in those days located in what is now Lincoln Park. Beyond\
        \ that was only a scattering settlement. Here, to this locality, about the\
        \ year 1840, Mr. Dyer moved, from a former residence in the city. One day,\
        \ in the street, a friend accosted him with the remark, ' Hello, Dyer, I don't\
        \ see you very often ; where do you live now ? ' ' O, I am very comfortably\
        \ situ ated,' replied Mr. Dyer without relaxing a muscle of his features,\
        \ ' I have a home beyond the grave.' His friend saw the point, circulated\
        \ the story, and Dyer was long known as the sojourner on earth who had a '\
        \ home beyond the grave.' \" THE CHICAGO LYCEUM. The Chicago Lyceum, an institution\
        \ in which for many years were centered largely the social, as well as the\
        \ intellectual interests of Chicago's citizens, was insti tuted December 2,\
        \ 1834. From this .time until the 22d of December of the following year, it\
        \ had a mere informal existence, no attempt being made for a perma nent organization\
        \ until the last-named date. At this time, however, a constitution was adopted,\
        \ by-laws framed, and the following persons chosen its first officers: A Cowles,\
        \ George Manierre, William Jones and O. M. Dorman, vice-presidents ; (name\
        \ of president not given ; ) George O. Haddock, recording secretary ; E. I.\
        \ Tinkham, treasurer, and H. K. W. Boardman, librarian. At its weekly meetings\
        \ were discussed ques tions of importance, and there was not a prominent citizen\
        \ of Chicago in those days who was not a member of the Lyceum and who did\
        \ not take a lively interest in its proceedings. Hon. Thomas Hoyne, who was\
        \ an early member of the Lyceum, and in 1840 its secretary, recalled just\
        \ prior to his death, which occurred July, 1883, some of his recollections\
        \ of its early days. He said : As an institution exercising a healthy and\
        \ energiz ing influence in this community, as promoting the social and intellectual\
        \ interests of the society of early Chicago, the Lyceum deserves more than\
        \ the passing notice here given. It is to be regretted that the material is\
        \ not obtainable from which to write a fuller history of its life and growth\
        \ from its organization to the close of its existence as a distinct and separate\
        \ society. On the discontinuance of the Chicago Lyceum, the Young Men's Association\
        \ was organized (see article on same), and the library of the first-named\
        \ society finally drifted into the hands of the latter, where it remained\
        \ until destroyed by fire October, 1871. Young Men's Lyceum. \u2014 This institution\
        \ was exclu sively a young men's affair. No doubt its origin was a direct\
        \ outgrowth of the influences emanating from the Chicago Lyceum, inspiring\
        \ the young to higher intel lectual attainments. It was organized September\
        \ 25, 1843, with the following officers: David D. Griswold, president; Edwin'\
        \ C. Stone, vice-president; William H. Scovill, secretary, and Edward Morey,\
        \ treasurer. For some reasons (whether from lack of proper support, or whether\
        \ merged into the Young Men's Association) which it has been impossible to\
        \ ascertain, the Young Men's Lyceum was only a short-lived institution. After\
        \ much research, nothing could be learned of its history more than has been\
        \ here given. It was little more than a debating-club. \" It was the foremost\
        \ institution in the city, when I came here in 1837. At the time I became\
        \ a member, not a man of note, not a man in the city of any trade or profession,\
        \ who had any taste for intellectual and social enjoyment, who loved books,\
        \ conversation and debate, but who belonged to the Lyceum. Why, to-day I can\
        \ recall the names of old friends, by scores almost, whose eloquence I have\
        \ listened to in its meetings. Some of them have long since paid the debt\
        \ of nature ; others are still living, honored and respected citizens of this\
        \ and other towns throughout the country, and not a few have, since the days\
        \ when they were active members of the Chicago Lyceum, achieved for themselves\
        \ brilliant reputations in their various walks In life. When I came here the\
        \ society had, for those days, an excellent library, consisting of, as I remember,\
        \ over three hundred volumes. Its meetings were generally held in the old\
        \ court-room, corner of Randolph and Clark streets. I say were generally held\
        \ there, for it was not infrequent that the bad weather and the condition\
        \ of the streets made it necessary for us to appoint the meetings in a locality\
        \ most convenient for the majority to attend. Later its meetings were held\
        \ in the hall of the old Saloon Building and in the Presbyterian church. We\
        \ ran along until 1^43 or 1844. The city was then entering upon its career\
        \ of rapid growth and development, which has since astonished the world, and\
        \ which about that time absorbed the interests of the citizens so much that\
        \ the Lyceum meetings began to be poorly attended and finally, as an institution,\
        \ it died from sheer neglect.\" SOCIETIES OTHER THAN SECRET. Of this class\
        \ there were many, some purely social in their character, others combining\
        \ charitable and social features. From 1840 to 1857 there were: New England\
        \ Society, organized in 1846; W. H. Brown, president; George A. Robb, George\

        and now they were in possession of a library that ere long was unsurpassed
        by any other in America save that at Harvard. From this time forward the library
        was a success. Five thou sand pounds were subscribed for a building, and at
        the first meeting of the Redwood Library Company the following officers were
        elected : Abraham Redwood, Rev. James Honyman, Rev. John Callender, Henry
        Collins, Edward Scott, Samuel Wickham, John Tillinghast, and Peter Bours,
        Directors; Joseph Jacob, Treasurer; Edward Scott, Librarian; and Thomas Ward,
        Secre tary. Henry Collins gave the lot of land, then called Bowling Green,
        on which the library edifice stands ; which lot has been increased in size
        within a few years by purchasing what was known as the Peleg Clarke estate.
        When the library company was organized, an architect of more than ordinary
        ability, Peter Harrison, who had been the assistant-architect of Vanbrugh
        in the erection of the Duke of Marlborough''s palace at Woodstock, was employed
        to design and build a suitable structure for the library. How well he performed
        his part, and how cultivated must have been the people for whom he worked,
        let the exquisite Roman-Doric temple that he erected tell. It has been well
        cared for, and, although in more than one instance it has been enlarged by
        additions to meet the increasing size of the library, the features and proportions
        of the original building, now comprising the front of the library, have been
        carefully preserved. From a few hun dred volumes the collection has grown
        until there are now more than twenty-five thousand on the shelves, extending
        over a wide field and embracing many rare and curious editions. It was in
        this library that the Rev. Dr. Stiles, for many years librarian, Dr. Waterhouse,
        and at a later date Channing, Allston, and others found food for thought,
        and here the present generation drink of the perennial spring that rejoiced
        and refreshed their fathers.', 2]
    - ['188 REMINISCENCES OF NEWPORT. The interest that Mr. Johnston took in Newport
        centred in the Redwood Library. At his suggestion the directors, in 1833,
        elected the Duke of Northumberland, Lord Lyndhurst, A. Agar Ellis, T. C. Cooper,
        Baron Hottinger and Dr. Edwards of Paris, and T. Bland, honorary members.
        From these gentle men he expected great benefactions to the Library. The father
        of the Duke, Lord Percy, had protected the Library in the Revolution, when
        the British troops were despoiling it. Ellis was Librarian to the British
        Museum ; Cooper, Secretary to the Commissioners of the Public Records of England
        ; Hot tinger, the Paris banker, had married a descendant of Abraham Redwood,
        and Edwards was a member of the Institute of Paris. From these gentlemen,
        as I have said, he expected substantial benefits to the Library, and he was
        not mistaken. In this way he secured a gift of eighty-four volumes of the
        Public Records of England, and fifty volumes of old and scarce works, the
        whole being valued at not less than fifteen hundred dollars. At this time
        a fresh impetus was given to the Library through the exertion and influence
        of Mr. Johnston, who became not only an active member of the Corporation,
        but also of the Board of Directors. In response to the above appeal, a number
        of other volumes were added to the collection, the gift of differ ent persons.
        Of one of the gifts, a folio copy of the " Bishop''s Bible," a notice appeared
        in the "Mercury" of Oct. 26, 1833, probably written by Mr. Johnston, or his
        friend Mr. Walker, in which it is stated that it was presented by a gentleman
        of Newport, who met with it in New York, in a manner as singu lar as unexpected.
        The donor''s name was withheld, and there is no reference to it in the records
        of the Library, but I think it more than probable the gentleman was Mr. Johnston
        himself. A few days later there appeared in the columns of the "Mercury "
        a copy of an original paper by Judge Scott, a relative of Sir', 1]

        \ Thomas Cohbett, who is said to have written more hooks in his time than\
        \ any man in New England ; William Hubbard, the celebrated historian of the\
        \ Indian wars ; Nathaniel Rogers, who was president of Harvard College ; and,\
        \ later, Joseph Green Cogswell, the teacher and founder of Eound Hill School,\
        \ and afterwards the noted Astor librarian. Then we have Professor Treadwell,\
        \ the great mechanical genius and inventor ; William Oakes, the learned naturalist\
        \ ; and, contemporaneous with them, that generous philanthro pist, Augustine\
        \ Heard, whose interest in his native town is perpetuated in a noble institution\
        \ for educating and benefit ing his townsmen. Besides these, many more might\
        \ be named who have adorned and illustrated our annals, Eke the Wrainwrights,\
        \ the Whipples, the Paines, the Bradstreets, the Cogswells, and the Eppes.\
        \ It is to such men as these that we are indebted for our present form of\
        \ government, our public school system, our in stitutions of learning, and\
        \ our marvellous growth and prosper ity as a nation. Who, therefore, can be\
        \ deemed more worthy of remembrance on this occasion than those who labored\
        \ so untiringly to advance the geneial welfare of the people ? It becomes,\
        \ then, not only our duty, but our pleasure, to recall their names, and recount\
        \ their manly virtues, their sterling character, their political y, their\
        \ faithful de votion to principles, and to thus gather inspiration from their\
        \ example to perform well and with unflinching fidelity the duties which devolve\
        \ upon us, citizens of the government whir-h they assisted in founding. The\
        \ Toast-master. \u2014 On the programme of the morning there was a poem by\

        \ that the exercises may be slightly varied, that poem will now be read by\

        \ so much more attention should be paid by his fellow-citizens to the flimsy\
        \ novelties of the day than to the solid and substantial articles which his\

        \ is by far the most genuine specimen of the true old-fashioned biuiio- pole\
        \ that I ever saw exhibited in the person of a young man. My friend Wastle\
        \ (Lockhart) has a prodigious liking for him. Here Wastle commonly spends\
        \ one or two hours every week he is in Edin- burgh, turning over, in the company\
        \ of his young friend, all the Aldines, Elzevirs, Wynkin de Wordes, and Caxtons,\
        \ in the collection, nor does he often leave the shop without taking some\
        \ little specimen of its treasures home with him. David Laing is still a very\
        \ young man, but Wastle tells me that he possesses a truly remarkable degree\
        \ of skill and knowledge in almost all departments of bibliography. Since\
        \ Lunn's death, he says, he does not think there is any of the booksellers\
        \ in London superior to him in this way. He publishes a catalogue almost every\
        \ year, and thus carries on a very extensive trade with all parts of the island.\
        \ I believe he has no rival in the whole country. This old gentleman and his\
        \ son are distinguished by their classical taste in regard to other things\
        \ besides books. They give an annual dinner to Wastle, and he carried me with\
        \ him the other day to one of these anniversaries. I have seldom seen a more\

        \ long, useful, and studious career, and the mere enumeration of whose contributions\
        \ to Scottish history, antiquities, and literature, would form a long catalogue.\
        \ In No. 49 he was long in partnership with his father (whose shop had formerly\
        \ been at the Canongate-head, near St. Mary's Wynd), under the designation\
        \ of \"William and David Laing,\" in 1826; but long before that period he\
        \ had become known to the frequenters of the shop as a young man possessing\
        \ an immense amount of bibliographic information. John Gibson Lockhart gives\
        \ us a descriptive account of the Laings' establishment, which no doubt was\
        \ a pleasant lounge for him and other literati of the day. In \" Peter's Letters\

        \ few scattered individuals of various classes and professions, among whom,\

        \ which he did with all the ardour of a bibliomaniac. He was made LL.D. of\
        \ his native university in 1864, and is believed to have edited and annotated\
        \ fully 250 rare works on Scottish history and antiquities. Indeed, no man\
        \ had a more sincere attachment to all that concerned the glorious past of\

        \ type have been exhausted in record ing the dates ; and the letter of the\
        \ eighth alphabet, for 1869, is an Egyptian capital M. In 1759 the standard\
        \ mark of a thistle was substituted for the assay-master's initials, and is\
        \ still continued. In 1784 a 'duty-mark' was added, the form being the head\
        \ of the sovereign. The silver mace of the city of Edinburgh is dated 1617;\
        \ the High Church plate, 1643.\" In No. 98 of the Bridge Street are the Assay\
        \ Office and Goldsmith's Hall. The former is open on alternate days, when\
        \ articles of gold and silver that require to be guaranteed by the stamp of\
        \ genuineness, are sent in and assayed. The assay master scrapes a small quantity\
        \ of metal off each article, and submits it to a test in order to ascertain\
        \ the quality. The duty charged here on each ounce of gold plate is 17s. 6d.,\
        \ and on silver plate is. 6d. The making of spoons and forks was at one time\
        \ an extensive branch of the silversmith trade in Edinburgh ; but the profits\
        \ were so small that it has now passed almost entirely into the hands of English\
        \ manufacturers. The erection of this bridge led to the formation of Hunter\
        \ Square and Blair Street much about the same time and in immediate conjunction\
        \ with it. The square and street (where the King's printing office was placed)\
        \ were both named from Sir James Hunter Blair, who was Provost of the city\
        \ when the bridge was commenced, but whose death at Harrogate, in 1789, did\
        \ not permit him to see the final completion of it. One of the earliest incorporated\
        \ trades of Edin burgh was that of the hammermen, under which were included\
        \ the goldsmiths, who, in 1586, were formed into a separate company. By the\
        \ articles of it, apprentices must serve for a term of seven years, and masters\
        \ are obliged to serve a regular apprenticeship of three years or more to\
        \ make them more perfect in their trade. They were, moreover, once bound to\
        \ give the deacon of the craft sufficient proof of their knowledge of metals,\
        \ and of their skill in the working thereof. By a charter of James VI., all\
        \ persons not of the corpo ration are prohibited from exercising the trade\
        \ of a goldsmith within the liberties of Edinburgh. Number 4 in this small\
        \ square, the north side of which is entirely formed by the Tron Church, contains\
        \ the old hall of the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, which was formed in 1681.\
        \ But long previous to that year the merchants of the city formed themselves\
        \ into a corporation, called the guildry, from which, for many ages, the magistrates\
        \ were exclusively chosen ; and, by an Act of Parliament passed in the reign\
        \ of James III., each of the incorporated trades in Edinburgh was empowered\
        \ to choose one of their number to vote in the election of those who were\
        \ to govern the city, and this guildry was the parent of the Merchant Company.\

        \ forth \u2014 that this company came into being. Its nativity was further\
        \ heralded by sundry other things of a troublous kind affecting merchandise\
        \ and its practitioners.\" King James VII. incorporated the company by a charter,\
        \ with additional powers for the regulation of its trade. Those were granted,\
        \ so it runs, \" be cause the art and science of goldsmiths is exercised in\
        \ the city of Edinburgh, to which our subjects frequently resort, because\
        \ it is the seat of our supreme Parliament, and of the other supreme courts,\
        \ and there are few goldsmiths in other cities.\" In virtue of the powers\
        \ conferred upon it, the company, from the date of its formation, tested and\
        \ stamped all the plate and jewellery made in Scotland. The first stamp adopted\
        \ was the triple towered castle, or city arms. \"In 1681,\" says Bremner,\
        \ in his \" Industries of Scotland,\" \" a letter representing the date was\
        \ stamped on as well as the castle. The letter A indicates that the article\

        \ was greatly accelerated, as its records attest, by liberal donations of\
        \ works in almost every class of literature. Among the earliest contributors\
        \ in this generous spirit, besides many of its own members, were Sir James\
        \ Hall, Bart., of Dunglas, so eminent for his attainments in geological and\
        \ chemical science ; his son, Captain Basil Hall, R.N., the well-known author;\

        \ service to an infant institution.\" In the centre of the southern part of\
        \ the street is St. John's Established church, built in 1838, in a mixed style\
        \ of architecture, with a Saxon door way. It is faced on the north side by\
        \ a handsome ten-ace, portions of which rise from an open arcade, and include\
        \ a Primitive Methodist church, or Ebenezer chapel, and an Original Secession\

        have lived in it at one time or another. Sir Arthur Helps died in Lower Berkeley

        \ to see ra-conch.es, and steam-boats, and air-balloons in al use, may perhaps\

        \ we have in the way of speed. \" Would that I could have kept up at the same\

        \ work of it to get to Car marthen by half-past one o'clock on Sunday morn-\
        \ At Carmarthen I resolved to pitch my tent, and roosted, as owls are said\
        \ to do, in the ' Ivy Bush.' Nothing particular occurred there ; and about\
        \ half-past eleven in the day I proceeded to the pretty little town which\
        \ we fancied contained your I beyond price. I reached the 'White Lion,' aegan\
        \ my inquiries amidst the ringing of bells, ii distracted me, but of which\
        \ I subsequently found myself the unconscious cause. Remember, I don't mean\
        \ housebells, for the ' White Lion ' ts no such luxury\u2014 I mean the church-bells,\
        \ which were set going in tbeir merriest peak to do iionour, for which, in\

        \ for a library, which I entered. In a subscription-book lying ou the counter,\
        \ I read over a list of the fashionables who graced the place\u2014 Mr. and\
        \ Mrs. and three Misses Evans, Mr. Hugh Jones. Mr. David J and Miss Jones,\
        \ Mr.. Mrs., and Master and Miss ' Morgan, Captain and Mrs. Rice, Mr. and\

        \ Price Price Morgan Reas of Mmllabyth, and a vast many other similar names\
        \ filled the pages \u2014 but no Haineses. I thought this odd, and there-\
        \ fore ventured to push my iuquiries to the librarian. I He put his finger,\
        \ first on his forehead, then on his ' nose, and then on his lip ; and, turning\
        \ to a very pretty rosy-cheeked girl, said, ' Weren't those people's name\
        \ Haines who had Evan Thomas's house?' 'Indeed to Heaven it was,' saiei the\
        \ ' That's it, sir,' saiel the librarian, ' 'eleed is it ; they have been\
        \ gone away these three weeks, sir \u2014 a lady and daughter.' '\"Exactly\
        \ so,' said I; 'now, can you tell me whither they went r1' \" ' That I can't\
        \ indeed,' said the librarian ; ' but if you will let me send over to Evan\
        \ Thomas, I have no doubt he will know.' \" My permission was soon granted,\
        \ and the in- formation soon gained \u2014 the Haineses had gone to Malvern\
        \ ; where, for all Mr. Evan Thomas knew, they were still sojourning. Of course,\
        \ I made every preparation for pursuing them to that lovely spot m the morning\
        \ ; taking, however, the opportunity of a delightful evening to abstract the\
        \ linch-pins from all the bathing-machines which were ranged under the cliff\
        \ ; for which little mental and bodily i exertion I was amply repaid before\
        \ my departure, by beholding the actual overthrow of three of the ; said machines\
        \ during their progress to the sea, and i the consequent ejectment of three\
        \ fair tenants in a. I state of inconceivable distress ; not to speak of two\
        \ i others of the vehicles, which, when I first opened i my window at the\
        \ 'White Lion,' were lying on their sides on the beach, looking like a brace\
        \ of dead I elephants. . i Refreshed by breakfast and the success of my [\
        \ exploit, I started from Tenby ; but as I met with . no adventure of any\
        \ importance, and more espe i cially as I am quite convinced that you are\
        \ more anxious to hear of my arrival at Malvern than any l thing else, I shall\
        \ say not a word as to my journey s thither \u2014 or rather, hither \u2014\

        \ and perhaps produce my expulsion from the community ; for Mrs. Steer, mine\

        \ ; and although, as the gallant gentleman has not, in all probability, had\
        \ the advantages which we have derived from Doctors' Commons, he may imagine\
        \ that he might console the widow for the loss of her late Mr. Haines, and\
        \ at the same time render himself, as the husband of Mrs. M'Guffin, extremely\
        \ comfortable for the rest of his days \u2014 rely upon it he will be disappointed.\

        \ ladies, and I will stake my existence that be fore a fortnight is over our\
        \ affair will be concluded. \"We have some extraordinary characters here,\
        \ but I know too well the nature of your complaint to fancy that I could interest\
        \ or even divert you for a moment by a description of them. It i3 curious\
        \ to see. for English people, how sociable they get in this Well House. It\
        \ is the constant association, the necessity, as it were, of making society,\

        \ I ought, however, just to tell you that, on the night of my arrival, I discovered\
        \ that the bedroom candles belonging to all the guests are placed upon a table\
        \ behind a screen in one corner of the saloon, so that each person after supper\
        \ \u2014 for as we dine at three, that conciliating meal is considered absolutely\
        \ essential to our existence \u2014 each person can depart at plea- sure,\
        \ and all \u2014 Without hurry, or bustle, or care. \" The moment I made this\

        \ into a basin of water, which I found in their company on the table, and\
        \ which seemed to have been placed there on purpose to tempt me. The result\
        \ was that, on the depa. of the first squad ox tabbies \u2014 for like fruit\
        \ on a tree, in a place like this, the most matured drop off first \u2014\

        \ would have fancied a magnificent display of fireworks had been going on\
        \ \u2014 or rather off \u2014 in the distance, during which ex- periment,\
        \ accompanied by the lamentations of the venerable sisterhood, Major M'Guffin\
        \ kept his great green eyes immovably fixed upon me ; whether he only suspected\
        \ me as the author of the mischief, or, favoured by his unusual height, had\
        \ looked over the screen, and seen me at work, I could not then make out,\
        \ nor have I since discovered ; nevertheless and notwithstanding, I flatter\
        \ myself I am, upon the whole, popular. \" As for Emma, your description did\
        \ not do her half justice \u2014 I think her perfection \u2014 her eyes are\

        classical scholars who saw its absurdity were generaUy on the side of the
        ancients, and were inclined rather to veil than to expose the blunders of
        an ally ; the champions of the moderns were generally as ignorant as Temple
        himself; and the multitude was charmed by his flowing and melodious diction.
        He was doomed, however, to smart, as he well deserved, for his vanity and
        folly. Christchurch at Oxford was then widely and justly celebrated as a place
        where the lighter parts of classical learning were cultivated with success.
        With the deeper mysteries of philology neither the instructors nor the pupils
        had the smallest acquaintance. They fancied themselves Scaligers, as Bent
        ley scornfully said, if they could write a copy of Latin verses with only
        two or three small faults. From this College proceeded a new edition of the
        Let ters of Phalaris, which were rare, and had been in request since the appear
        ance of Temple''s Essay. The nominal editor was Charles Boyle, a young man
        of noble family and promising parts ; but some older members of the society
        lent their assistance. While this work was in preparation, an idle quarrel,
        occasioned, it should seem, by the negligence and misrepresentations of a
        bookseller, arose between Boyle and the King''s Librarian, Richard Bent ley.
        Boyle, in the preface to his edition, inserted a bitter reflection on Bent
        ley. Bentley revenged himself by proving that the Epistles of Phalaris were
        forgeries, and in his remarks on this subject treated Temple, not indecently,
        but with no great reverence. Temple, who was quite unaccustomed to any but
        the most respectful usage, who, even while engaged in politics, had always
        shrunk from all rude colli sion and had generally succeeded in avoiding it,
        and whose sensitiveness had been increased by many years of seclusion and
        flattery, was moved to most violent resentment, complained, very unjustly,
        of Bentley''s foul-mouthed raillery, and declared that he had commenced an
        answer, but had laid it aside, " having no mind to enter the lists with such
        a mean, dull, unman nerly pedant. " Whatever may be thought of the temper
        which Sir William showed on this occasion, we cannot too highly applaud his
        discretion in not finishing and publishing his answer, which would certainly
        have been a most extraordinary performance. He was not, however, without defenders.

        Christchurch was up in arms ; and though that College seems then to have been
        almost destitute of severe and accurate learning, no academical society could
        show a greater array of orators, wits, politicians, bustling adventurers who
        united the superficial accomplishments of the scholar with the manners and
        arts of the man of the world ; and this formidable body resolved to try how
        far smart repartees, well-turned sentences, confidence, puffing, and in trigue
        could, on the question whether a Greek book were or were not genuine, supply
        the place of a little knowledge of Greek. Out came the Reply to Bentley, bearing
        the name of Boyle, but in truth written by Atterbury with the assistance of
        Smahidge and others. A most remarkable book it is, and often reminds us of
        Goldsmith''s observation, that the French would be the best cooks in the world
        if they had any but cher''s meat ; for that they can make ten dishes out of
        a nettle-top. It really deserves the praise, whatever that praise may be worth,
        of being tbe best book ever written by any man on the wrong side of a question
        of which he was profoundly ignorant. The learning of the confederacy is that

        \ ; for he fancied how uneasy tbe squire would be until the true George Emmer\
        \ son was fonnd. Indeed, so great waa Godfrey's popularity in Buttervote that\
        \ the two libraries were compelled to order from London oue copy each of his\
        \ new novel, ao tbat the work was frequently asked for by five or six people\
        \ a day ; aud the librarians swore (upon honour) tbat, although they had ordered\
        \ (Heat en only knows how many copies) yet, such was the demand for tha work,\
        \ it could not be obtained for either love or money. So Gods rey became exceedingly\
        \ popular in Butter vote : uot on account of tho merits of his novel, but\
        \ solely because it could not be obtained, and at last it became quite the\
        \ fashion to ask for it. Those who did procure it invariably kept the three\
        \ volumes a week. Thus, in both the libraries, the work found eight readers\
        \ a month in Buttervote ouly. The Bines actually clubbed together to keep\
        \ the Pinks from reading it ; the Pinks pursued the same course towards tbe\
        \ Biues. It was like starting a new magazine and afforded each party as much\
        \ ex citement as a little election. that is unpardonable ! Pity tbat Godfrey\

        \ \"I will get Godfrey Malvern to draw np an advertisement, and insert it\
        \ in the papers,\" was the conclusion Hopkins came to as he walked home. \"\
        \ Ingledew wil! never rest until the heir is fonnd, and I will do my best\
        \ to make him once more happy.\" Had Ingledew himself overheard thia soliloquy\
        \ he would have laughed outright, so great would his joy have been at the\
        \ thought of having bl man like Hopkins, and that by \" assuming a virtue\
        \ which he had not.\" \" I hope he isn't. And yet there are worse women than\
        \ my wife in the world. Heaven knows the ' babby ' might have been mine! Such\
        \ things have happened before now, aud will again, although it's against the\
        \ law. Yot there are very many good laws, while others are very foolisb. The\

        \ revolution or an eclipse cannot always be depended upon , no more than the\
        \ coming of a comet. There was a wide differenee^etween these two characters.\
        \ Hopkins was generally sincere in all he did ; he seldom bid his hatred beneath\
        \ a cloak ; if he promised forgiveness, lie meant what he said. Within himself\
        \ he was tolerably straightforward ; it was only when another broke faith\
        \ with him tbat he became suspicious, but even then he conld easily be pacified.\
        \ He contained within himself the elements of a good man, yet dangerous as\
        \ gunpowder when his passions were once heated \u2014 a tool tempered to cut\
        \ or bend, aud very useful iu the hands of a man like Ingledew. The squire,\
        \ on the other haud, was sincere in nothing he did, unless it appertained\
        \ to bis own selfish ends. If, in a moment of unguarded kind ness, he made\
        \ any concession whicb he could uot well retreat from, the next hour found\
        \ his brain busily employed iu studying how he might best bend it to suit\
        \ his owu selfish purpose. Thus, when he yielded to the wishe3 of his daugh\
        \ ter, and invited Godfrey Malvern to make the hall of Sutton-cum-Bottesford\
        \ his future home, he had bia own secret motives for so doing ; for Godfrey\
        \ had already distinguished himself in London by his writings, and it fed\
        \ the squire's vanity when he thought that his daughter had married somebody\
        \ now held in much higher estimation than the obscure village schoolmaster\
        \ \u2014 the poor poet who published his first volume by subscription, and\
        \ occasionally contributed to the Buttervote news papers. The librarians rubbed\
        \ their hands with delight. Each obtained ninepeuce a day for weeks for a\
        \ work which but few read, and which so many were anxious to possess. Bells\
        \ were pulled and knockers ham mered at wherever the party was known who held\
        \ the coveted volumes. \" A man cannot constantly depeud upon himself. I have\

        \ \" Women are always backward to tell their ages ; and this ia a pity \u2014\

        \ a deep interest in all that coucerned Maria, and that it mattered not whatever\
        \ the subject might be, he always looked at it in his own peculiar light,\
        \ and came to a different conclusion to what other people did respecting it\
        \ ; and this sprang from his odd notions about originality. He well knew that\
        \ the evil Godfrey and Maria had committed was very great ; but then, he argued\
        \ to himself, that punishment would make the matter no better\u2014 that the\
        \ misery each endured was, of itself, a terrible penalty, and that it would\
        \ be carry ing cruelty too far to add one jot to what tbey already suffered.\
        \ Maria was broken-hearted, and truly penitent for what she had done ; and\
        \ as to Godfrey Malvern, death would, indeed, have been a relief from the\
        \ mental anguish which he day and night endured, for he had more than once\
        \ meditated ending his wretchedness by suicide. \"Of what avail would it be,\"\
        \ argued Gregory to himself, \"to publiBh their sins to the world\u2014 to\
        \ expose them both to the gaze of the public ? Her, ninety men out of the\
        \ hundred would look upon with mingled feelings of pity and admiring pas sion.\
        \ For him, the women would heave a sigh, and be sorry, and think not a bit\
        \ the better of their ' brutes of husbands ' at home. To virtue it would bring\
        \ no good, and vice would aee nothing in it, to shudder at. Had Godfrey failed\
        \ in his literary speculations, he might have died iu some obscure garret\
        \ in Lon don, and been buried at the expense of the parish \u2014 it would\
        \ never for a moment bave disturbed the squire's slumbers \u2014 he would\
        \ have offered comfort to Emma, tried to squeeze out a tear of sympathy for\
        \ her sorrow, while he contemplated another match for her, and hoped for \"\
        better luck next time.\" What use he might have turned Godfrey's \" false\
        \ step \" with Maria into if be had been apprised of it, we will not hazard\
        \ an opinion upon ; the im morality of the matter would have given him no\
        \ concern whatever \u2014 he would have made it sub servient to some selfish\
        \ purpose of his own. But the case was very different. Wherever he went he\
        \ heard the praises of his son-in-law ; for in the borough of Buttervote,\
        \ Godfrey Malvern was now held up as one of the greatest geniuses of the age.\
        \ The two papers took their tone from such of the London papers as were most\
        \ favourably disposed towards Godfrey's new novel, and quoted, and praised,\
        \ and lauded him to the skies, taking care, however, to instil into the minds\
        \ of their readers that they (the editors) were the first to discover his\
        \ great talent. The borough was in a complete fervent about Godfrey ; and\
        \ when tbe sqnire gave it out that his gifted son-in-law might shortly be\
        \ expected to pay thema passing visit, it was resolved upon to give him a\
        \ public dinner in the town ball ; and more than one bad commenced writing\
        \ out the speeches which they intended to deliver (extempore, of course) on\
        \ that memorable occasion. Indeed, five or six of Godfrey's most ardent admirers\
        \ had gone so far as to subscribe sixpence each, intending to present him\
        \ with a silver pencil-case, as a slight token of their \u25A0sincere admiration\
        \ of his genius. Miss Julia Wiggins had also obtained permission of a market-gardener\
        \ to cut as much laurel aa she liked out of the little shrubbery at the front\
        \ -of his cottage, to make a garland for Godfrey when he came, similar to\

        \ being aware of its situation, were it not for the high oceanic peak of Ball's\

        \ its own hills are even higher, Mount. Gower being 2,800 and Mount Lidgbird\
        \ some 100 feet lower. The soil is volcanic, but rich, and covered with a\

        \ that is, if it can be bo. For the passenger's footway lies right through\
        \ the first-floor fronts of the houses \u2014 which are cleared away altogether,\
        \ and above the shop, of ordinary normal position, by the roadside; and thus\
        \ the back drawing-rooms, or whatever else they may be, are turned into more\
        \ shops ; and great is the puzzle of the stranger as to whether the roadway\
        \ is down in the cellar, or he is up-stairs on the landing, or the house has\
        \ turned itself out of window ; afford ing a literal proof of that curious\
        \ state of domestic affairs so often spoken of. And first he fancies the \"\
        \ row \" \u2014 as it is termed \u2014 is like the Quadrant, with the road\
        \ excavated a floor lower, and shops made under the pavement ; and then it\

        \ divide the large convivial room into so many Httxe philandering ones, drav/n\
        \ away, and the windows knocked out. And, finally, he arrives at the conclusion\
        \ that there is nothing else in the world at all like it, nxcept the lithographs\
        \ published by the enterprising librarians who live there. But very convenient\
        \ is this arrangement for old and wonder at, worthy of a place in the museum\
        \ of the Water Tower. One only inconvenience do the rows present ; convivial\
        \ gentlemen, who won't go home till morning, under ordinary sooial circum\
        \ stances, must be apt to descend suddenly into the valleys, which here and\
        \ there break their continuity in the shape of by-streets. But this may be\
        \ amended in time by the good gentlemen, who pay such pen-and-ink attention\
        \ to the sanitary con dition of large towns, and form a grotto for Hygeia\
        \ at the bottom of an inkstand. Even the chronicles of Chester are as quaint\
        \ as the place. Think of King Edward the First, when he was here, in 1277,\
        \ ordering that everybody who could spend twenty pounds a year should be made\
        \ a knight ! Why, you might have stopped at a hostelry then, and ordered a\
        \ \" Sir \" to bring you a Jack of humming ale ; or brought your hood, or\
        \ jerkin, of a real '* Lady \" at the first shop you chose to turn in at.\
        \ Read on, too, how in 1356, the Mayor's feast, comprising all the delicacies\
        \ if the season, cost only eleven shillings and tenpence ! A happy time was\
        \ that for his lordship ! the most unrelenting, be- headland and spire-pointed\

        fact, Mocenigo sent three letters to the Inquisitor-General of Venice, severally
        bearing the dates of the 23rd, 25th, and 29th of May. But as each letter is
        almost a repetition of the other, I have condensed the three into one. But
        in substance, and in a certain degree even in form, the above letter contains
        an accurate description of the charges Mocenigo brought against Bruno.', 1]

        with the quiet dignity that was native to him : "He has never done anything
        to make me believe that he was not a Christian," adding, with a certain significance,
        "had he done so, he would not have been my guest." The words contained an
        implied rebuke which was not without its weight upon the official body. The
        house of Morosini was too illustrious for any member of it to be trifled with.
        Yet Morosini''s answer had been given in perfect good faith. Bruno had never
        spoken directly against Catholicism ; and Morosini had too little comprehension
        of his mystical philosophy to be aware of its indirect implications. On the
        29th of May Giacomo Britanno, librarian, is cited to give his depositions.
        Mocenigo hoped more from his evidence than from the other witnesses, since
        there was a certain friendship between himself and Britanno. , Moreover, Bruno
        had shown such a decided preference for the society of Ciotto, that Mocenigo
        hoped that Britanno would be smarting under a certain personal feeling, and
        would give his evidence accordingly. Yet when the critical question is asked
        this librarian : " Do you know if the prisoner Giordano Bruno is a good Christian
        or no ? " he too answered : " When with me, the said Giordano Bruno has never
        spoken a word to make me believe that he was not a good Christian." The Inquisitor''s

        \ if nothing else, might have full play without interruption and intrusion\
        \ from those deemed outside the particular and shining pale. Accordingly a\
        \ room was rented and furnished in Bohemian fashion, with some cane chairs,\
        \ a deal table, a cocoa nut matting and spittoons. In this the first meeting\
        \ was held, in order to baptise, in characteristic liquid, the club. The meeting\
        \ in question debated, with the assistance of sundry pewters and pipes \u2014\

        character) on the social and political events of the day, supposed to be written
        by one brother, resident in town, to his less sophis ticated brother in the
        country. In the same journal, Clarke wrote a descriptive sketch of the mining
        mania which had seized upon Sandhurst at the time ; and for brilliancy the
        sketch is among the best efforts of his in journalism. At this period, also,
        he once more tried his hand at the drama, and adapted for John Dunn, his father-in-law,
        Molierie''s celebrated comedy, "de Bourgeois Gentilhomme," into English, under
        the title of " Peacock''s Feathers," which was played with great suc cess
        at the Theatre Royal. Mention has been made of the interest Sir Redmond Barry
        evinced in the rising litterateur, whom he took under his parental wing, when
        obtaining for him the secretaryship of the Public Library Trustees. And this
        interest and regard the respected judge retained for his protege, despite
        his oft-repeated thought less acts, to the end of his life, which end arrived,
        strange to say, only some few months before that of the much younger man,
        who, on hearing of Sir Redmond''s death, expressed himself as having lost
        his best and most influential friend ; and without doubt the late President
        of the Trustees of the Public Library did, on more than one occasion, induce
        his colleagues to over look the unhappy neglect of duty on the part of their
        secretary and sub-librarian. But with all the warm regard there existed between
        the venerable judge and the youthful author, there was always a certain characteristic
        hauteur on the one hand, and a reverental humility on the other, in their
        official and social relationships. In proof of this a couple of examples may

        \ Needham-Market in Suffolk ; but as his Arianism soon revealed itself, his\
        \ hearers left the chapel, and Priestley left the place. In 1755 he was accepted\

        \ devoted himself to his schools and his scientific studies. He now pubhshed\

        \ belles-lettres at Warrington, where he married the daughter of a wealthy\
        \ iron-master of Wales. His industry was very great ; he studied almost all\
        \ branches of literature, wrote on a large number, preached, lectured, and\
        \ with unremitting perseverance carried on his experiments in the pur suit\
        \ of science. In 1765 the university of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary\
        \ degree of LL.D. in recognition of the merits of his \" Chart of Biography.\"\

        \ for a short time Commissioner of Works under the new Government. His health\
        \ had been failing when he accepted the Governorship of Madras ; the change\
        \ of climate came too late to save him. He was more, perhaps, sincerely regretted\
        \ in the political world than is often the lot of minor politicians. One young\
        \ and promising career came to an untimely con clusion in this year. Mr. Arthur\
        \ O'Shaughnessy had early taken a prominent place among the constellation\
        \ of young poets who grouped themselves around the central sun of Mr. Swinburne.\
        \ He was an official of the British Museum, which in the early years of the\
        \ decade of 1870 was a perfect hotbed of talented writers. Russian Ralston\
        \ and Assyrian Smith were then among its servants ; so was and is Mr. Richard\
        \ Garnett, most erudite of librarians, most scholarly of critics, most graceful\
        \ of translators. But it was especially rich in youthful poetry. It could\
        \ boast at this time of sheltering under its capacious roof no less than three\
        \ poets, all young, all clever, all ambitious, and all apparently likely to\
        \ see their ambitions gratified. Mr. Theophile Marzials has since become more\
        \ a follower of music than of verse. Mr. E. W. Gosse is apparently deter mined\
        \ to surpass his reputation as a poet by his reputation as a keen and accomplished\
        \ critic. Mr. O'Shaughnessy's career ended too soon to be fairly estimated.\
        \ To say that his work was largely under the influence of Mr. Swinburne's\
        \ genius is only to say that he shared the fate of every writer of verse who\
        \ made his appearance at the time when the three stars in the belt of Orion\
        \ \u2014 Mr. Swinburne, Mr. William Morris, and Mr. Dante Gabriel Rossetti\
        \ \u2014 were in the ascendant. He pos sessed a delicate command of musical\
        \ metres ; his verse was conspicuously melodious in an epoch of melodious\
        \ verse. He might have won his way to a proud place among the poets of his\
        \ time. He died young.", 1]

        \ in the month of May, 1S83, resolved that it would be desirable \"to print\
        \ the Addresses of the Chamberlains of the City to those on whom its Honorary\
        \ Freedom had been conferred, from the date of the Accession of King George\
        \ III., together with the Replies of the Recipients; and that the Work do\
        \ also include Addresses presented by the Court of Common Council to Foreign\
        \ Sovereigns and other distinguished persons, not receiving the Freedom, together\
        \ with their Replies thereto.\" In compliance with this Resolution, the Library\
        \ Committee of the Corporation \u2014 presided over successively by Mr. James\
        \ L. Shuter, F.R.A.S., the late Chairman, and Mr Henry Hodsoll Heath, J. P.,\
        \ the present Chairman \u2014 requested Mr. Benjamin Scott, the Chamberlain,\
        \ to undertake the collection of the necessary materials, in which work he\
        \ received the co-operation of Sir John Monckton the Town Clerk, and of Mr.\
        \ W. H. Overall the Librarian. The Committee entrusted the editing, printing,\
        \ and publishing of the Work, to Messrs. Cassell and Company. Upon consideration,\
        \ it has been thought desirable to ante-date by about three years the period\
        \ for commencing the returns, taking as a starting-point a very important\
        \ crisis in English History, when, in 1757, the Right Honorable William Pitt,\
        \ afterwards first Earl of Chatham, and the Right Honorable H. B. Legge, third\
        \ son of the Earl of Dartmouth, then lately Chancellor of the Exchequer, were\
        \ complimented by the presentation of the Freedom.1 Had the record been traced\
        \ a few years earlier it would have brought under review the closing effort\
        \ of the Stuart Dynasty to regain the English throne; for in January, 1745\
        \ \u2014 6, the Duke of Cumberland was congratulated \" for his magnanimous\
        \ behaviour during the Rebellion in favour of the Pretender, and for his vigilant\
        \ care in protecting the City.\" The following Series, commencing with the\
        \ great Earl of Chatham, appropriately ends with the well-deserved compliment\
        \ paid to the philanthropic Earl of Shaftesbury, who, it is hoped, will attend\
        \ to receive his Freedom while these pages are passing through the press.\
        \ A few words on the custom and practice of the City of London in reference\
        \ to the Freedom may be of interest. There are four methods by which it may\
        \ be acquired : \u2014 (1) By Patrimony ; the sons of a Freeman being entitled,\

        \ a man (who had wounded him) dead, and there were many injured. This decisive\
        \ mode of action pre vented the reassembling of the mob during the night.\
        \ Until ten o'clock on Sunday morning the streets were patrolled by only a\
        \ few detached parties, when the whole troop was marched to Queen square.\
        \ Instead of the 14th there attacking the mob, the mob attacked the military,\
        \ who were obliged to charge in their own defence and to use their pistols,\
        \ or they would have been torn from their horses. Still disinclined to extreme\
        \ measures, Colonel Brereton, to con ciliate the mob, ordered Capt. Gage to\
        \ march the whole squadron out of the city, saying that they would be all\
        \ murdered. The soldiers were then withdrawn to Keynsham, leav ing the town\
        \ and the lives and pro perty of the inhabitants at the mercy of a mass of\
        \ infuriated ruffians. A thundering attack was made upon the Mansion house\
        \ by the mob, who, forcing their way in, took possession of the wine cellar,\
        \ and further in flamed their wild passions by the choice liquors they therein\
        \ found. In no long time the Mansion house and two sides of Queen square were\
        \ in flames, 41 spacious houses being ultimately consumed. With a faint gleam\
        \ of consideration for those they were injuring, which stands out in grim\
        \ relief in the midst of surround ing horrors, they would knock at a house\
        \ door and give the inmates half-an-hour's warning to save what they could,\
        \ at the expiration of which brief notice they would begin their work of destruction.\
        \ Soon after this the mob proceeded to the old Bride well, St. James' back,\
        \ and released the prisoners that were to have been tried by the MRecorder\
        \ ; the whole of this prison was then burnt except two cells. The Gaol on\
        \ the New cut was afterwards attacked, and 175 prisoners freed ; but the buildings,\
        \ except the governor's house, which was destroyed, resisted the flames. At\
        \ Lawford's gate prison the like work of demolition ancl liberation was also\
        \ accomplished. At 8 o'clock on Sunday evening the Bishop's palace, adjacent\
        \ to the Cathedral, was fired and destroyed. The Chap ter library was wasted\
        \ and the Cathe dral archives burnt. One precious document, the Cartulary\
        \ of the Chap ter property, with the margin singed, was lately restored to\
        \ the Cathedral by John Taylor, afterwards chief city librarian, who accidentally\
        \ came into possession of the volume. The Cathedral itself was saved from\
        \ the incendiaries by the spirited conduct of the sacristan and a few other\
        \ persons, who met the first of them with a bar of iron (yet preserved). In\
        \ Queen square the fury of the mob again increased, and the Man sion house\
        \ was set on fire, the Custom house also being shortly after in con flagration.\
        \ Here some of the incen diaries sat down to a meal in an upper apartment,\
        \ when suddenly the flames burst in upon them. Some threw themselves from\
        \ the windows, others from the housetop, and were dashed to pieces, others\
        \ fell back into the flames. One woman who jumped from the window died next\
        \ morning. The Excise office in King street afforded plenty of liquid fuel\
        \ in about 50 puncheons of rum, which became ignited, the fires of ruin now\
        \ kindled being such as might have afforded a picture for a local Milton \u2014\

        \ walls of the bottomless abyss, as told in the mighty language of the origi\

        \ The reflection of fires on the horizon was seen at a distance of 40 miles\
        \ round. One fellow was heard to say (we mention it as an instance of coarse\
        \ humour) : \u2014 \" I'm curs'd if this bean't very funny. Charley com'd\

        \ plays had been given, but it is supposed to have been in Tucker street (now\
        \ Bath street), in a house afterwards used as an Inde pendent chapel, of which\
        \ \u2014 Gough was minister in 1714 ; this building was destroyed when Bath\
        \ street was made, in 17S6. The prohibition of 1704 does not seem to have\
        \ been quite effectual, as two years later, in 1706, another grand jury brought\
        \ the subject before the Quarter Ses sions, when ' ' Mr. Power and his com\
        \ pany\" were prohibited from acting stage plays within the liberties of the\
        \ city. According to the late city librarian (J. F. Nicholls), Power and his\
        \ company had been perform ing in the theatre on St. Augustine's back (afterwards\
        \ Lady Huntingdon's chapel), now Salem chapel, and on this second decision\
        \ against them they took refuge in the theatre at Jacob's wells. This is probably\
        \ a mistake. Power's company most likely removed outside the city to a building\
        \ in Stokes' croft, the site of which was nearly opposite the Bap tist college.\
        \ This was used as a theatre for some years, advertise ments of performances\
        \ there in 1743 and 1745 being still in existence. About 1726 the \" new theatre\
        \ \" at Jacob's wells was built by John Hippisley, the original \"Peachum\
        \ \" of Gay's Beggar's Opera, which was first played in London in 1728, and\
        \ had the unprecedented run of 63 successive nights. \"The Liston of his day,\"\
        \ as Hippisley has been called, managed this little theatre successfully for\
        \ many years, bring ing down for his summer seasons in Bristol many actors\
        \ and actresses from London, where at that time performances were not given\
        \ during the hot weather. In a little book called Memorials of the Bristol\
        \ Stage, written by Richard Jenkins in 1826, some interesting details are\
        \ given of Hippisley and other Bristol actors of this period, and the arrangements\
        \ and incidents connected with the Jacob's wells' theatre are most amus ingly\
        \ described. It was not, appa rently, a very complete or attractive structure,\
        \ for Chatterton lampoons it in a poem called \"The Exhibi tion,\" wherein\
        \ he says : \u2014 Lost to all learning, elegance and sense, Long had this\
        \ famous city told her pence ; Avarice sat brooding in a whitewash'd cell,\
        \ And pleasure had but a Jacob's weU. Two MS. volumes were given by the late\
        \ Richard Smith to the Bristol Museum and Library, whieh contain numerous\
        \ notes on the early history of the stage in Bristol, and copies of advertisements\
        \ and play-bills from the year 1747 (Jacob's wells' theatre) to 1810 (King\
        \ street). The Theatre Royal, in King street, was opened 30th May, 1766, the\
        \ prologue being written by Garrick, and he also pronounced it to be the most\
        \ complete of its dimensions in Europe. There was great opposi tion to its\
        \ erection, especially by the Quakers. The first performance con sisted of\
        \ a concert of music and a specimen of rhetoric ; the latter was a comedy\
        \ entitled The Conscious Lovers. The proceeds of this per formance (\xA363)\
        \ were given to the Infirmary. It was not till 1778 that a special license\
        \ was obtained from the King to settle the theatre on a firm basis by overruling\
        \ the by-laws of the city, under which players in unlicensed houses were liable\
        \ to be punished as rogues and vagabonds. This theatre is now one of the oldest\
        \ in the kingdom, and probably the only one in which during its early days\
        \ such histrionic stars as Shuter, Young, Quick , Siddons, the Kembles, Macready\
        \ and Powell have appeared. In more recent times its boards have been graced\
        \ by Marie Wilton (now Mrs. Bancroft), Madge Robertson (now Mrs. Kendal),\
        \ Henrietta Hod son, Kate and Ellen Terry, Arthur Stirling, Arthur Wood, the\
        \ Rignolds, and many others, whose successes on the London stage after they\

        such as drunkenness, brawling, or blasphemous swearing, the punishment on
        the first occasion was to sit in the stocks one day and a night, with bread
        and water, the second time two days and two nights, the third time three days
        and three nights ; if after that the offence was repeated the sinner was "
        to be expulsed and driven out of the house for ever." The ancient charters
        and records of St. John''s and St. Nicholas'' Hospitals were carefully set
        in order and many of them transcribed by the Rev. Henry Hall, M.A., who was
        appointed Librarian at Lambeth by Archbishop Potter (1744), and subsequently
        became Rector of St. Michael''s, Harbledown. His work was completed by the
        Rev. Dr. Beauvoir, whose MS. "Liber Hospitalium Archiepiscopi" is at Lambeth.
        Duncombe, the historian of the Hospitals, has quoted largely from these records.
        It is pleasant to see the care with which the inmates cultivate their little
        plots of garden ; to observe their happy and cheerful demeanour ; and to know
        that this ancient and interesting institution is now admirably administered
        under the Wardenship of the Bishop of Dover, as Arch deacon of Canterbury.
        On the other side of Northgate Street, immediately opposite the hospital,
        formerly stood the gateway leading to the church of St. Gregory, also a foundation
        of Archbishop Lanfranc, intended for secular priests, whose duty it was to
        administer spiritual comfort to the poor of the hospital, and to officiate
        at the burial of their dead. Leland states that the church was converted into
        a priory for Black or regular canons in the time of Henry I. No vestige of
        the church or priory now remains.', 1]

        it was, the city in which our youth dwell amid the " beauty born of fair works,

        A Story of the Eoman Invasion. By G. A. Hentt. With 12 page Illustrations
        by W. Parkinson. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6s. This story deals
        with the invasion of Britain by the Roman legionaries. Beric, who is a boy-chief
        of a British tribe, takes a prominent part in the insurrection under Boadicea:
        and after the defeat of that heroic queen (in A.D. 62) he continues the struggle
        in the fen-country. Ultimately Beric is defeated and carried captive to Rome,
        where he is trained in the exercise of arms in a school of gladiators. Such
        is the skill which he there acquires that he succeeds in saving a Christian
        maid by slaying a lion in the arena, and is rewarded by being made librarian
        in the palace, and the personal protector of Nero. Finally he escapes from
        this irksome service, organizes a band of outlaws in Calabria, defies the
        power of Rome, and at length returns to Britain, where he becomes a wise ruler

        and a Map. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6s. A large part of this
        story deals with the revolt of the Greeks, in 1821, against Turkish oppression.
        Mr. Beveridge and his son Horace, like most Englishmen at that time, are stirred
        with enthusiasm for the down-trodden nation. So they fit out a privateer,
        load it with military stores, and set sail for Greece to assist the insurgents.
        On their arrival, however, they find that the leaders of the insurrection
        are a cowardly, thieving, blood thirsty crew. So they resolve to hold aloof
        from politics, and give all possible assistance to the victims of war, both
        Greeks and Turks. They rescue the Christians who are beleaguered in the island
        of Cyprus, assist the Turkish garrison in Athens, relieve the captive Greeks
        who are being sent to the slave markets, destroy Turkish shipping, and fight
        the Turkish war vessels. The story is full of stirring adventure, and will
        delight the boy who loves the sea, and the hazards of seafaring. A', 1]

  - - ['149 CHURCH CATECHISM ON PREDESTINATION Turning now to this Catechism, and
        reflecting that for forty years it was given officially to the Protestants
        of the kingdom, almost as a part of the inspired word of God, one need scarcely
        ask whence the Puritans derived their so-called peculiar ideas of predestination
        and the perseverance of the saints. It required nothing but a little amplification
        to develop it into the famous West minister Catechism, so far as these subjects
        are concerned. A few extracts will show its character.* It was entitled "
        Certain Questions and Answers touching the Doctrine of Predestination." "
        Q. Why do men so much vary in matters of religion ? " A. Because all have
        not the like measure of knowledge. Nei- ther do all believe the gospel of
        Christ. "Q. What is the reason thereof? "A. Because they, only, believe the
        gospel and doctrine of Christ which are ordained unto eternal life. " Q. Are
        not all ordained unto eternal life ? "A. Some are vessels of wrath, ordained
        unto destruction; as others are vessels of mercy, prepared to glory. " Q.
        How standeth it with God''s justice that some are appointed unto damnation
        ? "A. Very well: Because all men have in themselves sin, which de serveth
        no less. And therefore the mercy of God is wonderful, in that he vouchsafeth
        to save some of the sinful race, and to bring them to the knowledge of the
        truth. British collection. Taking the two collections together, and they are
        doubtless incomplete, I find thirty-five editions containing the Calvinistic
        Catechism between 1574 and 1615. The examination in the British Museum was
        kindly made for me by Mr. S. R. Van Campen, an American author resident in
        London, while my informa tion regarding the contents of the Lenox Library
        has been derived from its learned librarian, Dr. George II. Moore. * I give
        these extracts, because, so far as I kuow, this Catechism is unnoticed by
        general historians.', 1]

    - ["18 A PEEP INTO THE PAST. were in the town 9 librarians, music sellers, &c,\
        \ 2 printers, and some 3 or 4 toymen. The building trade, considering the\
        \ rapid rate at which the town increased, was, doubtless, a thriving one.\
        \ No less than 21 master builders are down in the list ; 6 plumbers, painters,\
        \ and glaziers ; 9 cabinet makers, upholders, &c. ; 2 ironmongers ; 2 blacksmiths\
        \ ; 2 tinmen ; 3 stonemasons ; and 4 whitesmiths and bell-hangers. In the\
        \ furnishing way are 1 earthenware man ; 1 china and glass man ; 2 cutlers\
        \ ; 2 coopers ; and 1 basket maker. Three auctioneers were ready to do duty\
        \ for the community in the way of disposal of goods, &c. ; but if a more quiet\
        \ way were preferred, 1 broker and appraiser was at their service, who might,\
        \ if occasion arose, be supplemented by 1 porter. The conveyance of visitors,\
        \ &c, to and from the town, was, as might be supposed, an important business.\
        \ There were no less than 12 London coach-proprietors; 2 London stage-waggoners;\
        \ 3 London carriers ; 2 Lewes carriers ; 3 corn chandlers ; 1 horse dealer\
        \ ; .3 livery stable keepers ; 5 farriers ; 4 saddlers and harness-makers\
        \ ; 2 coachmakers ; 1 coach painter ; and 1 wheelwright. The miscellaneous\
        \ trades may be summarised as follows : \u2014 3 coal merchants ; 1 sign painter\
        \ ; 1 wire worker ; 3 boat builders ; 1 sail maker ; and 1 cricket bat maker.\
        \ Altogether, the trading community numbered 422 persons, irrespective of\
        \ lodging-house-keepers, whose calling was not then, as it is now, followed\
        \ as a business. In going through the list of the \" tradesmen \" of the town\
        \ in 1800, we cannot help noticing the extraordinary junction of trades carried\
        \ on by various individuals. For instance, Mr. James Gregory, who was Librarian\
        \ on the Steine, had a medicine and toy-warehouse at 2, North-street, and\
        \ also carried on a coal-merchant's business in Middle-street; Mr. Wilmshurst,\
        \ a watchmaker, at 7, North-street, had also a leather-cutting business at\
        \ 19, Middle-street ; Mr. Thomas Harmer, at 43, North-street, combined the\
        \ businesses of wire-worker, grocer, and auctioneer ; Mr. Cobby, of 2, Prince's-place,\
        \ hosier and undertaker ; Mr. Verrall, 9, Nile-street, upholder and tallow\
        \ chandler ; Mr. Harry Attree, 15, Ship-street, wine-merchant, draper, and\
        \ up holder ; four individuals were both blacksmiths and grocers ; another\
        \ did business as tea dealer and basket maker ; another as pastry-cook and\
        \ victualler, and another as silversmith and toyman.* The practice of individuals\
        \ carrying on two or more trades in con junction would seem to have been a\
        \ primitive one ; for as early as 1758 Thomas Lulham at Brighthelmston, advertised\
        \ for an apprentice to an \"upholder, tallow chandler, and soap boiler.\"\
        \ Surely the Mr. Verrall above-mentioned, who carried on the same trades in\
        \ 1800, did not learn his art and practice under Thomas Lulham ! In 1764,\
        \ Wm. English, of Lewes, and Ship-street, .Brighton, sold gold and silver\
        \ goods, cutlery, and iron and tin ware; Bibles, lestaments, and Common Prayers\

        \ these goods were not disposed of in the ordinary way of purchase, \" But\
        \ were set up to sale, by the rattling of dice.\" Books and baubles, every\
        \ article of convenience, every trinket of luxury, was disposed of by this\
        \ uncertain, quick mode of transfer. There was not a shop without the indispensable\
        \ \"rattle-trap.\" The amount of business done must have been enormous ; for\
        \ it was rattle, rattle, rattle, from \" morn to noon, from noon to dewy eve.\"\
        \ The Libraries \u2014 which after 1774 were kept open \" regularly all the\
        \ year \" \u2014 were subscribed to by all the fashionable visitors, and,\
        \ it might be said, by all the unfashionable visitors, as the fact of a name\
        \ being entered into the subscription-book afforded a convenient passport\
        \ into the hallowed precincts of \"Society.\"*! The Libraries, like the shops,\
        \ had their \" rattle-traps ; \" but though indispensable for carrying on\
        \ business, were regarded only as minor adjuncts to it. A somewhat higher\
        \ and more exciting game was pursued there. This was the great god \" Pam,\"\
        \ j who for many a year was the supreme fashionable deity ; its devotees including\
        \ the young and old of both sexes. \" Pam \" attained early popularity by\
        \ reason of its affording a convenient opportunity for pastime, for small\
        \ wit, and flirtation. But by some visitors it soon began to be voted \" slow\
        \ \" : and a \" fair correspondent,\" in 1777, writing from Brighton, says\
        \ \u2014 \"What are called the polite amusements are making such rapid progress\
        \ that she is under great apprehensions for her old friend and favourite Pam,\
        \ * Smuggling was a prevalent fashion at the period. It was considered a \"\
        fair game\" to cheat the revenue officers. In 1776 a chaise was brought to\
        \ Brighton from Dieppe, and over \xA31,000 worth of lace was found stuffed\
        \ in the cushions ! A Frenchman was also caught on the Steine carrying some\
        \ loaves, and, on his attempting to dispose of them at fancy prices, suspicion\
        \ was excited. When the loaves were opened by the revenue officers, they were\
        \ found to have \" lace\" interiors ! t There was a sort of rivalry between\
        \ Mr. Thomas and Mr. Bowen, the two librarians of the Steine, as to whose\
        \ subscription-book should most justly deserve the title of the \" Book of\
        \ Numbers \" \u2014 \" names,\" rather than character or position in society,\
        \ being regarded as of primary importance. This rivalry induced a constant\
        \ struggle between the Librarians as to which should Vie the most courteous,\
        \ and the effects were those usually consequent upon opposition. Mr. Thomas\
        \ was from the first regarded as the \" fashionable bookseller ; \" but Miss\
        \ Widgett's successor, Mr. Bowen, who bowed a la Norerre or Gallini, soon\
        \ seemed to carry away most of the custom and company from Thomas's. Fanny\
        \ Burney says Mr. Bowen was \" extremely civil, attentive to watch opportunities\
        \ of obliging, and assiduous to make use of them\u2014 skilful in discovering\
        \ the taste or turn of mind of his customers, and adroit in putting in their\
        \ way just such temptations as they are least able to withstand. Mrs. Thrale,\
        \ at the same time that she sees his management and contrivance, so much admires\
        \ his sagacity and dexterity, that, though open-eyed, she is as easily wrought\
        \ upon to part with her money as any of the many dupes in this place, whom\
        \ he persuades to require indispensably whatever he shows them.\" X \" Pam,\"\
        \ or \" Loo,\" was simply a sweepstakes, played for by cards. The subscribers\
        \ were limited to eight, each staking one shilling. The chances were taken\

        \ cut and separately dealt and turned; the numbers and fictitious names of\

    - ["THE STEINE AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS. 137 being Mr. James Gregory, who was assisted\
        \ by his brother, Mr. Richard Lemmon Gregory.* On the last day of November,\
        \ 1798, the Princess Amelia, the amiable and affectionate youngest daughter\
        \ of George III., paid her first visit to Brighton. She was then in her 15th\
        \ year, and is described \" as rather tall and very handsome ; and was dressed\
        \ in a light-coloured riding-habit and a close cap tied under the chin with\
        \ broad lace.\" This estimable young lady had been staying at Worthing for\
        \ some months\u2014 a veritable martyr to that baneful hereditary disease\
        \ of her family which subsequently hurried her to her tomb. The Prince of\
        \ Wales went more than once to see her whilst at Worthing ; and doubtless\
        \ he spoke of the Pavilion and the Steine, which gave rise to her wish to\
        \ see Brighton, though scarcely able to endure the journey. Her Royal Highness\
        \ came in one of His Majesty's coaches, drawn by four horses, and was accompanied\
        \ by Lady A. Cumberland and a gentleman. The Royal carriage, preceded by General\
        \ and Miss Goldsworthy in a curricle, and attended by General Cuyler on horseback,\
        \ was drawn very slowly round the Pavilion and Steine, up North-street and\
        \ down West street, where it halted for a few minutes at the house of General\
        \ Cuyler, whose lady waited on the Princess at the carriage door and politely\
        \ invited Her Royal Highness to alight or to take some re freshment in the\
        \ coach, both which she with great affability declined, and, taking leave\
        \ of Mrs. Cuyler, proceeded with her retinue by the lower road on her return\
        \ to Worthing. In the first few years of the present century the Steine reached\
        \ its highest point as the resort of \" company \" ; and, though frequented\
        \ by far greater numbers, in these years, it in many respects resembled those\
        \ of 1790-93 \u2014 the previous most brilliant epoch in its history. Never\
        \ before had there been within its circumference such a throng of high-born\
        \ and wealthy and more or less distinguished visitors ; and, day after day,\
        \ evening after evening, during the fashionable hours, it was all animation\
        \ \u2014 all gaiety. In the autumn of 1802, though visitors had previously\
        \ been \" legion,\" the cry was, \" still * Mr. Richard Lemmon Gregory, like\
        \ one or two other of the Steine Librarians, was a \"local character,\" and\
        \ known to every visitor. He was subse quently associated with the Libraries\
        \ in North-street ; first at Choat's and then at Loder's. He died in 1851,\
        \ and the following valedictory notice of him appeared in the Brighton Herald\
        \ : \u2014 \" Very many of the old inhabitants of the Town will remember a\
        \ smart, clapper, active, brisk little old man, who dressed in corduroy knee-breeches,\
        \ speckled worsted stockings, tie-low shoes, a dark-figured swans down waistcoat,\
        \ a dark brown single-breasted coat, cut like a Quaker's, and who for many\
        \ years catered to their literary wants in the Libraries. This was the veritable\
        \ 'Dick Gregory,' who has just shuffled off this mortal coil in his 84th year.\
        \ He was remarkably clean in his person ; though any thing certainly but a\
        \ fop. His thin grey hairs he smoothed over his brow, and his face was always\
        \ radiant with smiles. He had a sharp, ready answer for every one, and every\
        \ one used to like a gossip with ' Dick Gregory.' He thought for himself ;\
        \ no man more so. He possessed a sturdy mode of reasoning, with gentle or\
        \ simple\u2014 no matter which\u2014 and which he never disguised ; yet he\
        \ could say sharp and distasteful things to high-flown Tories, but in a style\
        \ that amused and rarely, if ever, offended ; for all the frequenters of the\
        \ Library knew what sort of answers\u2014 if they put questions\u2014 they\
        \ were likely to get from Dick. He was full of anecdotes, and told them with\

        \ is irresistible, and the town was never known to be so full in the middle\
        \ of October \" ; and another states, \" the Steine was lively even in November.\"\
        \ This must surely have been the \" Golden Age \" of lodging-house keeping\
        \ in Brighton ! Over ioo houses had been built in the previous ten years,\
        \ yet \" accommodation \" was insufficient. In the next year or two, the want\
        \ was still felt; in 1804, perhaps more so. So early as in May of this latter\
        \ year it was said, \" the Steine is increasing in gaiety and fashion.\" In\
        \ July, such was the desire to reach Brighton, that, irrespective of visitors\
        \ brought daily by tbe numerous coaches, \"at Cuckfield and Crawley, in one\
        \ day, no less than 50 pairs of horses were in requisition for conveyances\
        \ to that distinguished place of public resort.\" During race-time, by reason\
        \ of the influx of sport ing men, &c, matters in the way of accommodation\
        \ reached a climax. Every available place \u2014 regardless, in many cases,\
        \ of very scant con venience \u2014 was occupied ; and the disappointed, though\
        \ willing to pay any price, had to go elsewhere \u2014 to Hove, Rottingdean,\
        \ or wherever it was thought they could obtain a night or two's accom modation.\
        \ The French \"invasion\" scare was at its height in 1804 ; and Brighton \u2014\
        \ from its being the favourite residence of the Prince of Wales \u2014 was\
        \ regarded as the spot for Napoleon to land his troops ! But this did not\
        \ deter visitors from coming hither. The Lewes Weekly Advertiser, in September\
        \ of that year, says : \u2014 \" Brighton still retains a very considerable\
        \ portion of its company ; and, regard less of Master Boney's threats of invasion,\
        \ the Steine is daily prome naded by crowds of beauty, elegance, and fashion.\"\
        \ P'or several succeeding years, the influx of visitors \"knew no retiring\
        \ ebb\"; but to chronicle details would be needless repetition. One reason,\
        \ probably, for the rapidly-increasing popularity of Brighton at this period\
        \ was the fact that the Prince of Wales was more frequently here than heretofore,\
        \ and his visits were more or less prolonged. He mingled more in society ;\
        \ the entertainments at the Pavilion resumed their former brilliancy; and\
        \ that gaiety and hilarity in which he delighted, \u2014 and which his domestic\
        \ troubles of the last few years had somewhat clouded, \u2014 was again in\
        \ the ascendant. The Prince, in fact, had now wholly \" emancipated \" himself\
        \ from his wife ; listener wide awake. Poor Dick ! We believe that every soul\
        \ that knew him liked him. He possessed some property\u2014 it has been said\
        \ that he had claims to much more ; at any rate, when years induced him to\
        \ retire from a vocation he had long followed \u2014 librarian \u2014 he had\
        \ enough and to spare, and no man of late enjoyed his otium more than Dick.\
        \ It was quite joyous to see the capers he cut when above eighty, to show\
        \ that he was as agile as ever ; that he could play cricket, of which he was\
        \ very fond, as well as any boy ; and he would challenge any man at half his\
        \ age to run a mile. He had formed his reasoning for himself, and all the\
        \ eloquence or logic in the world had no effect whatever on Dick. He knew\
        \ every body that came to Brighton, and most of them, from the 'man in green\
        \ ' to Macnamara, knew him. He could tell numberless tales off-hand about\
        \ the American war, when he was a boy ; about the first Revolution in France,\
        \ and how he had seen the priests who came over in a hurry and landed in shoals\
        \ at Newhaven. His laugh was a sort of crowing\u2014 so sharp, clear, cheering,\
        \ we doubt if he ever knew what the 'blues' are. He was never 'hipped ' an\
        \ hour ; but sunshine and smiles always dwelt on his small but handsome features.\
        \ He died in the 84th year of his age, and will always rank as one of the\
        \ characters of the town. Peace to his manes I \"", 1]

        \ for the better preservation of the turf in the centre a neat fence was put\
        \ up, to prevent traffic over it in the winter, by leaving only the intended\
        \ circular walk and the bricked road across open. The new fence was intended\
        \ to be taken away during the summer season, and replaced on the approach\
        \ of every succeeding winter. The expence of the undertaking was defrayed\
        \ by voluntary subscription. In December, 1805, the original Library, on the\
        \ East side of the Steine, at the corner of St. James's-street, built by Mr.\
        \ Baker in 1760, was pulled down by Mr. Donaldson, the then proprietor; it\
        \ being too dwarfish to admit of suitable improvement by additions. The new\
        \ edifice, of noble elevation and dimensions (as we now see it, though the\
        \ lower portion of it has since been much altered), was opened in June, 1806,\
        \ the Prince of Wales graciously paying Mr. Donaldson the compliment of appointing\
        \ him bookseller and librarian to His Royal Highness. In connection with the\
        \ Libraries, it may be mentioned that raffling was done away with after the\
        \ passing of an Act of Parliament familiarly known as Mr. Vansittart's \"\
        \ Little-go Bill.\" This proved at first a sad drawback to the profits of\
        \ the Librarians, as the dice-box had been the chief means of disposing of\
        \ the multifarious kinds of ware which, in addition to books, &c, they were\
        \ accustomed to keep. To remedy the deficiency, trinket auctions were had\
        \ recourse to ; the \" Auction Lounge \" becoming associated with the Library\
        \ ; and of an evening, when the respective Librarians practised \"knock-down-blows''\
        \ with their \"magnetic hammers,\" there were crowded assemblages of the beau\
        \ monde. One enterprising Librarian, Mr. Wilks (some time associated with\
        \ Mr. Donaldson) had a \" Pic-nic Auction \" on the Steine itself, which,\
        \ we are told, \"exhibited a blaze of rank and beauty.\" The novelty, however,\
        \ of these trinket auctions soon wore off; and the Librarians disposed of\
        \ their wares in the ordinary way. To provide a sub stitute for raffling,\
        \ \" Pam,\" or \" Loo,\" was revived, and, being supplemented by \"lively\
        \ and enchanting music, vocal and instru mental,\" it maintained its attractive\
        \ influence for some years more. The position of \" Loo,\" as a fashionable\
        \ pastime, was, however, rudely assailed in 18 10, by an attempt being made\
        \ to constitute it an illegal game. For that purpose, information was lodged\
        \ against Messrs. Donaldson and Walker, the proprietors of the Steine and\
        \ Marine Libraries, and the case was heard at Lewes before a full Bench of\
        \ Magistrates. It being pointed out that the Magistrates", 5]
    - ["144 A PEEP INTO THE PAST. really had no jurisdiction in the matter, the case\
        \ was dismissed ; and the Librarians returned home rejoicing, and \" Pam \"\
        \ was, for the time, more popular than ever. The general characteristics of\
        \ the Steine at this period (about 1807-8) would seem scarcely recognizable\
        \ to a modern Brightonian, though there were some general points of correspondence.\
        \ The Steine was then unquestionably the prettiest part of Brighton ; and\
        \ very picturesque, with the sea in front ; the Marine-parade (with gaps at\
        \ intervals) stretching eastward, with wooden posts and rails running along\
        \ the broken edge of the cliff, itself often shelving down to the beach ;\
        \ while to the north, beyond the line of handsome houses skirting each side\
        \ ofthe broad green-sward, a glimpse was obtainable of grand old Hollingbury-hill.\
        \ The Steine itself was of greater extent than now, especially to the south\
        \ and east. It was undivided, except by a footpath across its centre, from\
        \ Castle-square to St. James's street. It was, too, for the most part, skirted\
        \ by a foot-path ; and the only pieces of carriage-road in connection with\
        \ it were on the east and west sides, and to the south-east. If, therefore,\
        \ it were desired to drive a vehicle from Castle-square to the \" Blue and\
        \ Buff\" houses (to the north of the Steine) it was necessary to proceed southward,\
        \ along the west side of the Steine, into Pool valley ; round the back of\
        \ Steine-place (now occupied by the York Hotel), and across the south end\
        \ of the Steine (in front of Russell House) ; thence along the east side,\
        \ round the back of Donaldson's Library (now the Railway booking-office, &c),\
        \ and down St. James's street, whence, passing along the east side of the\
        \ north part of the Steine, the destination was reached. A pretty circuit,\
        \ truly, to get from one place to another not fifty yards distant ! This inconvenience\
        \ was endured for nearly twenty years ; down, in fact, to the year 1826. The\
        \ delay, probably, arose from the desire of some of the townspeople to preserve\
        \ the Steine intact as a pro menade. But this was no longer possible in tbe\
        \ face of modern requirements and the changes taking place on every hand.\
        \ The Steine was not now the only fashionable promenade ; for the sea front\
        \ to the west was being opened up, and visitors could and did resort thither.\
        \ On the Steine itself a new order of things was apparent. In 1822-3 't had\
        \ been enclosed with iron fencing ; George IV. giving ,\xA3500 and the Town\
        \ Commissioners towards the improvement.* The York Hotel had supplanted Steine-\
        \ * The local fishermen strongly opposed this improvement. They had, says\
        \ a contemporary journal, \" from time immemorial enjoyed the privilege of\
        \ drying their nets on the Steine, and removing their boats thither in tempestuous\
        \ weather, paying for these privileges to the Lords of the Manor or their\
        \ Reeve, a reeve, consisting of six mackerel for every boat, as often as such\
        \ boats, severally, had landed to the number of one hundred long tale, six\
        \ score and twelve, but not otherwise. The Commissioners contended that this\
        \ rent proved the fishermen to be but tenants at will. It was not proposed\
        \ to shut them out of the privilege of drying their nets on the Steine ; but\
        \ the aborigines demanded a gate in connection with the new fencing of sufficient\
        \ width to admit their boats in case of necessity. They further alleged there\
        \ existed a document, dating from the reign of Elizabeth, in which a grant\
        \ was made of the Steine to the fishers and to their heirs for ever. The existence\
        \ of the document was, however, regarded as apocryphal, especially as rent\
        \ had been regularly paid", 1]

        \ Lending Library could be engrafted on the existing Library, which was subsequently\
        \ confirmed by the Town Council. To facilitate the arrangements, some official\
        \ changes were made ; the Curator (Mr. Lomax) was given the care only of the\
        \ Museum and Picture Gallery ; whilst a new Librarian (Mr. F. W. Madden) was\
        \ appointed, with the sole custody and management of the Library, under the\
        \ control of the Sub-Committee. The Victoria Lending Library was opened on\
        \ the 16th October, 1889, by the Mayor of Brighton (Alderman Sendall), when\
        \ Mr. H. J. Mathews (the indefatigable Chair- man of the Library Sub-Committee),\
        \ in giving a brief sketch of its formation, stated that about ,\xA32,100,\
        \ including the munificent subscription of ,\xA3 1,000 from Mr. Daniel Hack,\
        \ had been publicly subscribed for the Victoria Lending Library during the\
        \ Mayoralty of Alderman Reeves in 1887 (the Jubilee Year). How successful\
        \ the Free Library has been may be learnt from the results published in the\
        \ latest Report (September 30th, 1891). At that date the Reference Library\
        \ contained 1 1,778 volumes ; and since the opening (16th October, 1889) 69,111\
        \ books had been issued to 50,250 readers. The Lending Library also showed\
        \ most gratifying results. The Library contained on September 30th, 1891,\
        \ 23,359 volumes. The number of tickets issued (including 1 800 to residents\
        \ in Hove) since the opening were 9,785 ; and the books lent during the same\
        \ period amounted to 236,364. The Public Museum, since its open- ing in September,\
        \ 1873, has grown apace, under the intelligent and untiring supervision of\
        \ its respective Chairmen of Sub-Committees, the late Dr. Thomas Davidson,\

        \ have contributed largely by gifts and loans of inestimable value to its\
        \ material progress.* The marble portrait medallion, by Mr. T. Brock, R.A.,\
        \ of Dr. Davidson, which hangs over the South door of the room devoted to\
        \ British Geology, was pre- sented to the town in 1888 as a memorial of his\
        \ scientific services. The Museum has been fortunate in having associated\
        \ with it from time to time several other gentlemen who have taken considerable\

        \ the following ladies : \u2014 The late Mrs. M. P. Merrifield, who contributed\
        \ a number of beautiful drawings of invertebrate animals ; Mrs. Branwell ;\
        \ and Miss Agnes Crane, who arranged the Paris Basin collection of Tertiary\
        \ Fossils and the recent Brachiopoda, the Bryozoa or moss- animals, and the\
        \ Tunicata or \"sea squirts.\" Among the most valued trea- sures of the Museum\
        \ may be named \" The Willett Collection of Chalk Fossils ; \" a series of\
        \ minerals from the chalk ; a fine collection of fossils from the Cambridge\

        \ Of the local postal arrangements at the period we learn from A Description\

        \ Thursdays, and Saturdays) ; and returned only on Thursday and Saturday mornings.\
        \ A year or two later, Mr. Bowen (who succeeded Miss Widgett as Librarian)\
        \ officiated as Postmaster ; as did Mr. Bowen's successor, Mr. A. Crawford.\

        \ in summer. But even then postal arrangements both at Lewes and Brighthelm\

        \ 6th, 1785, the following paragraph appears : \u2014 \" A delay in the conveyance\

        \ to the trading part of the inhabitants of both towns, and particularly so\

        \ make breeches.\" In 1827, the old \"Footway to Hove\" (leading from the\
        \ top of North-street) was widened; in 1831 there was an important alteration\
        \ at the bottom of North-street, in the erection by William IV. of the Southern\
        \ Entrance (now removed) to the Pavilion ; and about 1834 there was considerable\
        \ improvement at the top of West-street, at which time Cranbourne-street was\
        \ formed (Mr. Rickard's School, in West-street, being removed for the purpose).\
        \ But the improvement of North-street was about 1845, when \" Durham \" and\

        \ It would be difficult to realize now the state of this locality at the time.\
        \ North-street at this particular spot was little more than 15ft. or 20ft.\

        \ an old inn yard, sunk in squalidity and filth, an old fashioned balcony\
        \ running in front of the upper rooms of some of the houses. \" Petty France\

        \ existing in the street, their erection dating back, it is thought, to the\
        \ time of the Commonwealth. With the view to rebuilding, one of the houses\

        \ her intolerant of such criticism. The topic had already been discussed for\
        \ some time in France when Swift's patron, Sir William Temple, introduced\
        \ it to England in a treatise upholding the superiority of Ancient to Modern\
        \ Learning. The Essay was not a critical one, nor did it aim at a careful\
        \ treatment of the subject. It was rather a collection, half-playful and half-serious,\
        \ of reflections on literary genius, couched in a graceful literary style.\
        \ The illustrations, drawn indiscriminatelyfrom classical legendand literature.\
        \ are not put forward as having any real historical basis : and Macaulay's\
        \ ridicule of their flimsiness is therefore misplaced. A reply to this treatise\
        \ was written by William Wotton, a youthful prodigy of scholarship belonging\
        \ to Catherine Hall at Cambridge, whose classical references are as much more\
        \ accurate than Temple's, as in humour and style he is inferior. One opinion\
        \ which Temple had hazarded, in favour of the genuineness of the so-called\
        \ Epistles of Phalaris, formed a subject of easy attack : and on the other\
        \ hand, the brilliant, but superficial, scholars of Christ Church, Oxford,\
        \ took up the cudgels on his behalf, and published, under the name of Charles\
        \ Boyle, afterwards Earl of Orrery, a new edition of the Epistles. Boyle did\
        \ not, indeed, as Macaulay wrongly represents, maintain the genuineness of\
        \ the Epistles. He expressly refrains from doing so, and indeed points out\
        \ the arguments that tell the other way. But he came into collision with another\
        \ opponent of the Christ Church clique, of stronger calibre than Wotton. For\
        \ the purposes of his edition he had borrowed from the Royal Library at St.\
        \ James's a manuscript of the spurious Letters : and the sudden withdrawal\
        \ of the manuscript, before its collation was complete, by Dr. Bentley, the\
        \ librarian, led Boyle to comment in his preface on Bentley's churlish act,\
        \ as one in keeping with his usual manners \u2014 pro solita humanUate sua.\
        \ Stung by the attack, Bentley added an appendix to a new edition of Wotton\
        \ 's Reflections, in which he ridiculed the flimsy scholarship of the Oxford\
        \ faction, and proved by overwhelming argu ments the absolute spuriousness\
        \ of the Letters. Bentley showed that the opposite contention was so obviously\
        \ absurd, and so entirely inconsistent with the known facts of antiquity,\
        \ that even a passing doubt on the subject convicted any man of ignorance.\
        \ If the Epistles were true, Phalaris had borrowed money from men who lived\
        \ 300 years after his death, had destroyed towns that were not founded. and\
        \ conquered nations that had no names ; had falsified the histories of Herodotus\
        \ and Thucydides, and had written in a dialect which he could not possibly\
        \ have understood.", 1]

        alleviate. I.32. Dr. Bentley. Richard Bentley (1662-1 742), Royal Librarian
        and, in 1699, Master of Trinity, Cambridge. He was the leader of that opposition
        to Sir W. Temple which Swift attacked in the Battle of the Books. The relation
        of Bentley and Wotton to the controversy is more fully dealt with in connexion
        with that book. 86, 1. 6. A friend of your Governor, i. e. Sir William Temple,
        whose complimentary references to Phalaris, in his Treatise of Ancient Learn

        the second edition of Wotton''s Reflections on Ancient and Modern Learning.

        will be immortal. 1. 11. his forementioned friend, i. e. Bentley. I. 17. A
        Satire against Wit was published in 1700 by Sir Richard Blackmore, and it
        is curious to find Swift professing his intention to undertake a business
        already attempted by one whom he made the object of his satire. 1. 26. the
        many volumes of late years written for a help to their studies. Such as the
        Delphine edition of the classics, written for the help of the French Dauphin.
        87, 1. 4. during the intervals of a long peace. This sentence is characteristic
        of Swift, in its looseness of expression, combined with perfect clearness
        of intention. The meaning is, of course, ''the times of leisure given by a
        long peace interposed between times of war.'' Such an expression was, perhaps,
        rather less absurd in 1696, when the book professes to have been written,
        than it would have been as applied to 1704, when it was published, and when
        England was in the midst of a war that showed no promise of an early conclusion.
        But Swift uses it with sarcastic meaning, as war was one of those human follies
        in which lucid intervals were to be assumed, even if they were seldom found.

        device, which Swift more than once attacks as a convenient contrivance of

        A Story of the Roman Invasion. By G. A. Hen-ty. With 12 page Illustrations
        by W. Parkinson. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6s. This story deals
        with the invasion of Britain by the Roman legionaries. Berie, who is a boy-chief
        of a British tribe, takes a prominent part in the insurrection under Boadicea:
        and after the defeat of that heroic queen (in a.d. 62) he continues the struggle
        in the fen-country. Ultimately Beric is defeated and carried captive to Rome,
        where he is trained in the exercise of arms in a school of gladiators. Such
        is the skill which he there acquires that he succeeds in saving a Christian
        maid by slaying a lion in the arena, and is rewarded by being made librarian
        in the palace, and the personal protector of Nero. Finally he escapes from
        this irksome service, organizes a band of outlaws in Calabria, defies the

        and a Map. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6s. A large part of this
        story deals with the revolt of the Greeks, in 1821, against Turkish oppression.
        Mr. Beveridge and his son Horace, like most Englishmen at that time, are stirred
        with enthusiasm for the down-trodden nation. So they fit out a privateer,
        load it with military stores, and set sail for Greece to assist the insurgents.
        On their arrival, however, they find that the leaders of the insurrection
        are a cowardly, thieving, blood thirsty crew. So they resolve to hold aloof
        from politics, and give all possible assistance to the victims of war, both
        Greeks and Turks. They rescue the Christians who are beleaguered in the island
        of Cyprus, assist the Turkish garrison in Athens, relieve the captive Greeks
        who are being sent to the slave markets, destroy Turkish shipping, and fight
        the Turkish war vessels. The story is full of stirring adventure, and will
        delight the boy who loves the sea, and the hazards of seafaring. A', 1]

        building, 150 feet long by 75 feet wide, was begun in 1858, and the corner
        stone laid on the sixteenth of April, 1859. This wing was finished and ready
        for use in the autumn of 1861. In the meantime, Mr. Peabody increased his
        gift to $500,000, and on the occasion of his visit to Baltimore in 1866, he
        raised the endowment to $1,000,000. To this princely sum, in 1869, he added
        Virginia and Tennessee bonds, which brought the fund to a total of $1,240,000.
        This west wing when completed was pro vided with a Lecture Hall, occupying
        the entire lower floor, and above it was placed a library apartment, 100 feet
        long by 40 feet wide, separated by a longitudinal partition from a large reading-room
        and offices for the public business. Before the building was finished, the
        Rev. Dr. John G. Morris resigned his place in the Board of Trustees to take
        the position of Librarian. The functions of this office he exercised with
        undoubted ability, from 1860 to the summer of 1867, and he also assisted the
        committees in securing able lecturers and accomplished concert masters. During
        the first three years, the collections of books grew less rapidly than later,
        because of the high rates of exchange and the necessity of importing books
        from Europe. Only books of scholarly value were to be col lected, and much
        time was spent in preparing printed lists of such as were suitable for a library
        of reference. From 1861 to the month of May, 1866, about 15,000 volumes had
        been collected, and their titles, written on cards, were placed in drawers
        for the free use of all per sons who came to read in the library. As an appro-',

        The Library, which had been placed and arranged on the second floor of the
        west wing, was formally opened to the public on October 25, 1866, in the presence
        of the Founder. On this occasion, Mr. Peabody received the citizens of Baltimore
        at the Institute, and listened to an address written by the Hon. John P. Kennedy,
        but which, in his absence, was delivered by Judge George W. Dob bin. To this
        Mr. Peabody replied in a sympathetic tone, which deeply impressed the large
        audience that crowded the hall. The Governor of the State, Hon. Thomas Swann,
        was also present and spoke in honor of the occasion. The work of the Institute
        was now in full operation, the Library was open to the public from 9 until
        4 o''clock daily except Sunday ; courses of lectures were delivered in the
        autumn and winter ; public concerts of orchestral music were given in the
        large hall ; and premiums of money and gold medals were annually conferred
        upon the most distinguished graduates of the city high schools. In the month
        of June, 1867, the Rev. Dr. Morris withdrew from his position in the Institute,
        and the Assistant Librarian, Mr. P. R. Uhler, remained in charge of the library
        until the autumn, when Mr. Nathaniel H. Morison, the newly elected Provost,
        entered upon his duties as chief executive officer of the Institute. At this
        time the library had secured more than 22,000 bound volumes, and the written

        deals with the invasion of Britain by the Roman legionaries. Beric, who is
        a boy-chief of a British tribe, takes a prominent part in the insurrection
        under Boadicea: and after the defeat of that heroic queen (in A.D. 62) he

        carried captive to Rome, where he is trained in the exercise of arms in a
        school of gladiators. Such is the skill which he there acquires that he succeeds
        in saving a Christian maid by slaying a lion in the arena, and is rewarded
        by being made librarian in the palace, and the personal protector of Nero.
        Finally he escapes from this irksome service, organizes a band of outlaws

        against Turkish oppression. Mr. Beveridge and his son Horace, like most Englishmen
        at that time, are stirred with enthusiasm for the down-trodden nation. So
        they fit out a privateer, load it with military stores, and set sail for Greece
        to assist the insurgents. On their arrival, however, they find that the leaders
        of the insurrection are a cowardly, thieving, blood thirsty crew. So they
        resolve to hold aloof from polities, and give all possible assistance to the
        victims of war, both Greeks and Turks. They rescue the Christians who are
        beleaguered in the island of Cyprus, assist the Turkish garrison in Athens,
        relieve the captive Greeks who are being sent to the slave markets, destroy
        Turkish shipping, and fight the Turkish war vessels. The story is full of

        in the fen-country. Ultimately Beric is defeated and carried captive to Rome,
        where he is trained in the exercise of arms in a school of gladiators. Such
        is the skill which he there acquires that he succeeds in saving a Christian
        maid by slaying a lion in the arena, and is rewarded by being made librarian
        in the palace, and the personal protector of Nero. Finally he escapes from
        this irksome service, organizes a band of outlaws in Calabria, defies the
        power of Rome, and at length returns to Britain, where he becomes a wise ruler
        of his own people. In Greek Waters: A Story of the Grecian War of Inde- pendence
        (1821-1827). By G. A. Henty. With 12 page Illus trations by W. S. Staoey,
        and a Map. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6s. A large part of this
        story deals with the revolt of the Greeks, in 1821, against Turkish oppression.
        Mr. Beveridge and his son Horace, like most Englishmen at that time, are stirred
        with enthusiasm for the down-trodden nation. So they fit out a privateer,
        load it with military stores, and set sail for Greece to assist the insurgents.
        On their arrival, however, they find that the leaders of the insurrection
        are a cowardly, thieving, blood thirsty crew. So they resolve to hold aloof
        from politics, and give all possible assistance to the victims of war, both
        Greeks and Turks. They rescue the Christians who are beleaguered in the island
        of Cyprus, assist the Turkish garrison in Athens, relieve the captive Greeks
        who are being sent to the slave markets, destroy Turkish shipping, and fight
        the Turkish war vessels. The story is full of stirring adventure, and will
        delight the boy who loves the sea, and the hazards of seafaring. A', 1]

        \ of Dick Dowden ? I pity the wretch to whom his name and merits are unknown\

        \ for dentists, than a broken head or a black eye. In Corbet, the kindliest\
        \ of human beings, and sincerest of Corkonians, the buttermilk of human friendliness\
        \ was ever sound in plentiful exuberance ; while the loud laugh and the jocund\
        \ song bespoke the candour of his soul. Never was a professor of odontology\
        \ less pedantic or less given to quackery. His ante-chamber was always full\
        \ of patients, awaiting his presence with pleasurable anticipation, and some\
        \ were known to feign a tooth-ache, in order to have a pleasant interview\
        \ with the dentist. When he made his appearance in his morning gown before\
        \ the crowd of afflicted visitors, a general titter of cheerfulness enlivened\
        \ the visages of the sufferers ; and I can only compare the effect produced\
        \ by his presence to the welcome of Scarron on the banks of the Styx, when\

        may not only prove of interest to both residents and visitors in the district,
        but may also be the means of preserving for the use of some future historian
        many interesting particulars which might otherwise be lost. Shortly after
        the commencement of the present work, the materials so rapidly accumulated
        on our hands, that it became absolutely necessary either to omit altogether
        several of the parishes enumerated in the Prospectus, or to greatly curtail
        the particulars respecting them ; and eventually the latter course was adopted,
        as being likely to cause the least amount of disappointment to our subscribers.
        To Mr. William Richardson, of South Cave, the work to a great extent owes
        its existence. He suggested its collection and publication, and, by the sacrifice
        of much time and labour, has materially assisted in its compilation. To the
        Clergy of the district for their uniform kindness in readily permitting access
        to Parish Registers, &c, we tender our sincere thanks. To T. Sturmy Cave,
        Esq., of Strawberry Hill, London, for much valuable help; to Mr. and Mrs.
        Barnard of Cave Castle, for free access to documents, and for important assistance

        \ the greatest fool whom I found at Mysore. I aUghted at a bungalow appertaining\
        \ to the British Residency. There I found an Englishman who, without any preface,\

        \ in 1836, King WiUiam IV. gave a proof of his good nature and simpUcity of\
        \ manners. The day was uncommonly gloomy, which, added to an imper fection\

        \ the speech with faciUty. Most patiently did he struggle with the task, often\
        \ hesitating, sometimes mistaking, and at others correcting himself. On one\
        \ occasion he stuck altogether, when, after two or three attempts to make\
        \ out the word, he was obliged to give it up, and turning to Lord Melbourne,\
        \ who stood on his right hand, he said, in a tone sufficiently loud to be\
        \ audible in all parts of the house, \" Eh! what is it?\" Lord Melbourne having\
        \ whispered the obstructing word, the King pro ceeded to toU through the speech;\
        \ but by the time he had got to the middle the librarian brought him two wax\
        \ tapers. The King then suddenly paused, and, raising his head, he addressed\
        \ the Lords and Commons on the spur of the moment, in a perfectly distinct\

        at the head of the naval and military forces, and was the principal, it may
        almost be said the only, channel of communication between the Colonial Government
        and the English authorities. The reasons which led the English Government
        to plant a convict settlement in New South Wales are only briefly indicated
        in the scanty papers discovered in the State Departments ; but when the Colony
        had been established its affairs formed the subject of periodical letters
        from the Governors, who wrote fully about the concerns of the settlement,
        receiving in reply despatches for their guidance and instruction. Most of
        this correspond ence has been preserved in the English Departments of State,
        either in the original or in official copies. Its value is inestimable. The
        despatches are full of information. The Governors were required by their instructions
        to keep the Home authorities well informed about matters great and small,
        and in the despatches sent to London almost every transaction that took place
        is minutely described. More than this, copies of all the proclamations and
        orders issued by the Governor and the military commander were forwarded for
        the information of the English authorities. These documents are recorded with
        the other State papers. The early history of New South Wales is founded mainly
        upon the despatches sent by the Governors to the authorities in England, and
        the despatches received by them in reply. The Records are comprised within
        measurable bounds, and as they fire the chief material out of which history
        must be made, it has been decided to print them as they stand. This course
        has been adopted on the recommendation of a Board, consisting of the late
        Hon. Geoffrey Eagar, Under Sec retary for Finance and Trade from 1872 to 1891
        ; Alexander Oliver, M. A., Barrister-at-Law ; Professor G. Arnold Wood, B.A.,
        Challis Professor of History at the Sydney University ; and R. C. Walker,
        Principal Librarian, Public Library. The Board having ascertained the nature
        of the documents at the disposal of the Government, came to the conclusion
        that the design with which the publication of the Official History was commenced
        could not be fully carried out unless the State papers and other', 1]

        by its circulation. No important effort is made by these successful business
        men to advance the prosperity of the town of their adoption, which con tains
        every scope for enlarging and retaining its name in capital letters on the
        map of England. Lethargy pervades the higher social powers to an extent unparal
        leled in no other equally populous district. Would it not conduce to their
        own aggrandisement if they could assert, with conscious pride, that Birkenhead
        is their dwelling-place ? The dormant condition of trade is considered by
        outsiders to be a grave reflection upon the upper ranks, who should hold it
        a conscientious duty to advance local interest in preference to that of an
        alien. If an infusion of sympathy and kind feeling could be induced to circulate,
        what a different tale may not the next historian tell ! No half measures achieve
        great ends. Goodwill and energy can revive the fallen fortunes of Birkenhead,
        and recall the brightness and brotherhood that existed in the days of long
        ago. In concluding this prefatory matter, I desire to return thanks to the
        Birkenhead Library Committee, who have courteously allowed the reproduction
        of a drawing in their possession, "The site of Birkenhead Park before it was
        a Park." They retain the right of reproduction of this drawing beyond this
        book. To the Librarians also I beg to express my obligation for literary assistance

        \ been erected in George town, to which the instruments are at the present\
        \ time (1892) being removed. The Congressional Library was established in\
        \ 1800, with a number of books obtained from London by Albert Gal latin, Dr.\
        \ Mitchell, and others. The following is the list thus obtained: \"212 folios,\
        \ 164 (piartos, 581 octavos, 7 duodecimos, and 9 magazines,\" \u2014 973 volumes\
        \ in all. It was then the only library of reference possessed by the Government,\
        \ In 1804 the number of volumes had increased to nearly 1,500, of different\
        \ languages. During the session of Congress of 1805-06, an appropriation was\
        \ made for the purchase of books, and placed in the hands of a joint committee\
        \ of the two Houses, consisting of Messrs. Mitchell and Baldwin of the Senate,\
        \ and J. Clay, T. M. Rudolph, and Dana of the House. Mr. Beckley was at this\
        \ time librarian. The library was then beginning to attract the attention\
        \ of the country, aud the suggestion was frequently made to authors that they\
        \ leave a copy of each of their works to it, \"as it would be a better advertisement\
        \ than could be secured otherwise.\" December 6, 1811, an act was passed by\
        \ Congress appropriating $1,000 per year for five years, which was to be added\
        \ to what remained on baud from former appropriations, for the piurchase of\
        \ books. Pre vious to the War of 1812-15 the number of books had increased\
        \ to three thousand, but during the invasion of the city by the British in\
        \ August, 1814, they were all destroyed. Thereupon, Mr. Jefferson offered\
        \ his valuable collection to Congress, consisting of about seven thousand\
        \ volumes, considered then the finest in the country, and this, purchased\
        \ for $23,950, became the nucleus for the new library. To its purchase, however,\
        \ objections were made, on account of the great number of Bibles it contained,\
        \ as well as the infidel character of some of the other volumes. George Watterstou\
        \ was appointed libra rian by President Madison in 1815, and superintended\
        \ the removal of the library three times. His successor was appointed by President\
        \ Jackson in 1829. The room for the library was finished in 1824. It is entered\
        \ from the gallery of the principal stairway west of the rotunda. As first\
        \ occu pied, it was ninety-two feet long, thirty-four feet wide, and thirty-five\
        \ feet hio-h. This was the main room, and in addition there was a room adjoining,\
        \ making the whole in the form of an L, the wing portion being of the same\
        \ width aud height as the main room. This main room was divided into twelve\
        \ arched alcoves, ornamented with pilas ters copied from the pillars of the\

        upper cases; thus making three stories, receding as they ascend, and the galleries
        are continued across the ends of the room. The galleries are all floored with
        cast-iron plates, and are protected by pedestals and railings. They are approached
        by two semicircular staircases of cast iron, recessed in the end of the walls
        of the room. At the time of the tire of December 24, 1851, there were in the
        library fifty-five thousand volumes, of which thirty-five thousand were destroyed,
        besides a number of valuable paintings, including Gilbert Stuart''s portraits
        of the first five Presidents. Since then, as the value of such an institution
        has been more and more appreciated, the library has constantly grown. In 1866,
        through the efforts of Rutherford B. Hayes, then a member of Congress from
        the second Ohio district, who was chairman of the committee on the library,
        the invaluable collections belonging to Peter Force of Washington were purchased
        for $100,000, and deposited in the library. These collections of books, pamphlets,
        etc., pertaining to early American history, are of inestimable value. In 1866
        the Smithsonian Library was added to the Library of Congress. In 1882 this
        library was enriched by the addition of the Toner Library, mentioned in the
        sketch of Dr. J. M. Toner in the "Medical" chapter of this volume. According
        to the latest published report of the librarian, that for the year ending
        December 31, 1890, the aggregate number of volumes in the library was then
        six hundred and forty-eight thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight, and of
        pamphlets about two hundred and seven thousand. Two copies of all copyright
        publications are required to lie deposited iu this library. John S. Meehan
        was appointed librarian May 28, 1839; John G. Stephenson, May 24, 1861; and

        twenty-eight acres of land on the right bank of the Eastern Branch. All the
        vessels that were afloat at the beginning of the War of 1812-15 had been thoroughly
        repaired at this yard. Before the war, there had been built here the following
        vessels: Ships, the Wasp and the Argus; the brig Viper, the frigate Essex,
        and twelve gunboats. After the war, and previous .to 1830, there were built
        the Columbus, of 74 guns; the frigates Potomac and Brandy trine, each of 44
        guns; the schooners Shark and Grampus, each of 12 guns; the sloop of war St.

    - ['PREFACE. IV either of the writers, is that it was found impracticable, on
        account of the peculiar exigencies of the enterprise, to consult with him
        as fully with reference to several of the chapters as it was earnestly desired
        to do; and it is also proper to say that wherever such omission was unavoidable,
        the work has suffered to that extent. The other gentle man whom it is also
        not only a duty, but at the same time a pleasure, to recognize iu this way,
        is Mr. David Hutcheson, assistant librarian in the Congressional Library.
        Mr. Hutcheson was, during the whole time of the writer''s labors in that library,
        always courteous and obliging, going beyond the requirements of his position
        in making valu able suggestions and referring to newspapers and books containing
        necessary informa tion; his extensive knowledge of the contents of the library
        peculiarly qualifying him for the performance of these acceptable services.
        That the work is without mistakes is not to be expected. Even Mr. Bancroft''s
        great "History of the United States" is sometimes referred to as "merely an
        exhibition of the idiosyncrasies of its author"; and if such a criticism can
        be passed upon the greatest of American historians, how can the least hope
        to escape, even when writing under the most favorable auspices, which was
        far from being the case in the preparation of this work? But it is not designed
        or desired to dwell upon this particular, further than to say that a great
        deal of matter of greater or less value was prepared which was necessarily
        excluded from the work in order to avoid the production of an exceedingly
        unwieldly volume. But even as it is, it is believed to possess some merit
        ; how much, must be left to the kind and considerate judgment of the reader.
        While upon this subject of value, it may not be inappropriate to call attention
        to a few of the errors in standard works corrected in this work ; for it is
        well known to all intelligent readers of history that even standard histories
        contain numerous errors, and that one of the objects of a careful writer is
        to correct the errors of his predecessors. In Barnes''s "School History of
        the United States" it is stated that the first public messages sent over the
        telegraph wires between Washington and Baltimore in 1844 were in reference
        to the nomination of James K. Polk for the Presidency. On page 466 of this
        work this is shown to be an error, the first public messages passing on the
        25th of May, 1844, while the announcement of the nomination of Mr. Polk for
        the Presidency was not made until the 29th of that month. In "The Story of
        Washing ton," by Charles Burr Todd, it is stated on page 38 that "This account
        is taken from the Washington letters in the State Department, and settles
        the much controverted point as to the authorship of the plan of the Capitol."
        By this, Mr. Todd means that in the text of his work he has established the
        fact that Mr. Hallett''s plan of the Capitol was selected instead of Dr. Thornton''s.
        In this supposition Mr. Todd is in error, and his assumption proves that he
        did not read all the correspondence on file in the State Department between
        President Washington and the commissioners, for that correspondence shows
        that while at one stage thereof it was thought best to adopt Mr. Hallett''s
        plan, yet, after further consideration, Dr. Thornton''s plan was in the',

        he was appointed by the President of the United States a member of the only
        board of health of the District of Columbia created by Congress. On April
        15, 1873, Governor Cooke appointed him sanitary commissioner to visit the
        principal European cities with the view of perfecting a sanitary system for
        the city of Washington. Dr. Verdi still continues in practice in this city.
        Dr. Simon I. Groot was born in Glenville, New York, March 16, 1820, graduated
        from the Berkshire Medical College, Pittsfield, Mas sachusetts, in 1846, and
        commenced practice in Virginia, remaining there until 1861, when he came to
        Washington, and has been engaged here in the practice of medicine according
        to homeopathic principles most of the time since then; though in May, 1888,
        he sold his practice to Dr. James A. Freer, who thus became his regular successor.
        Dr. Groot is probably the only homeopathic physician licensed by the Medical
        Society of the District of Columbia, but this was mainly, if not wholly, on
        the ground of his having graduated from a regular school of medicine. Dr.
        Charles Waldemar Sonnenschmidt, a native of Suhl, Prussia, was born January
        2, 1832. Both his father and grandfather were Lutheran ministers. He was educated
        by his father aud in various institutions until old enough to be subject to
        military service in his own country, and then he emigrated to the United States.
        He gradu ated at Georgetown College, District of Columbia, and commenced the
        practice of medicine in Washington in 1867. He has ever enjoyed a quiet and
        comfortable practice. Dr. Sonnenschmidt is a member of the American Institute
        of Homeopathy, and served for some years as secretary of the Homeopathic Medical
        Society of Washington. The Medical Society of the District of Columbia was
        organized September 26, 1817, and was subsequently chartered by Congress,
        by an act approved by the President of the United States February 16, 1819.
        By this charter the society was authorized to license duly qualified pihysicians
        to practice medicine within the District of Col umbia. The first officers
        were: Dr. Charles Worthington, president; Drs. Arnold Elzey and James H. Blake,
        vice-presidents; Dr. Henry Hunts, corresponding secretary; Dr. Thomas Henderson,
        recording sec retary; Dr. W. Jones, treasurer, and Dr. R, Weightman, librarian.
        A new hall for this society was commenced in 1867, and it was completed and
        dedicated in 1869, the ceremony occurring January 27. This hall is located
        on the south side of F Street, west of Tenth Street. It is three stories high,

        The institution is in need of a suitable building for general pur poses. The

        near New York Avenue. It was erected in 1890. The Catholic University of America,
        one of the prominent edu cational institutions of the National Capital and
        of the country, is pleasantly and advantageously located at the corner of
        Lincoln Avenue and Fourth Street East Extension. It was incorporated on the
        21st of April, 1887, and is, therefore, but a young institution. In addition
        to its original commodious buildings, it is securing such means as will enable
        it greatly to increase its facilities for accommodating all departments of
        work. At a meeting of the board of directors on the 8th of April, 1891, it
        was determined to erect, at once, a new building for the Hall of Philosophy.
        The means therefor were obtained from a bequest by Rev. James McMahon, rector
        of St. Andrew''s Church, City Hall Place, New York City, amounting to some
        $400,000. Dr. McMahon''s generosity is a fine supplement to the bequest made
        by Miss Caldwell, which furnished the magnificent building now occupied for

        him to take a pipe with him ever since we came back." " There''s consistency
        ! " said Freda. " Of course a wretched subaltern must follow the general,
        what ever his private opinion may be," said Arnold. " There''s one comfort,
        a pipe is no good in a hot wind." " Would a bath be more useful?" said Freda.
        "Alerton is just talking of having one." " Delicious," cried Arnold, jumping
        up. "ShaU I hunt up Merton?" "Yes, do," said Freda. The Koorianda swimming
        bath was a great attraction in hot weather. Water for it was pumped up by
        means of a windmiU. Harold talked of building a similar one at Charlcombe
        every summer, and changed his mind every winter. While the gentlemen bathed,
        the young ladies settled the question of pledge-signing. Beatrice promised
        to go with Freda on the following Tuesday, and if she found herseU of use,
        to become librarian to the Arethusa. " I shaU like to tell Howell I have signed,
        at any rate," she said. The Blackthorns took Arnold back as far as the Coomatta
        creek, a mile beyond their own gate. Beatrice was a good deal touched by two
        such proofs of devotion as a three-mUe walk in a hot wind with every prospect
        of walking back again, and renunciation of a weU-beloved pipe. She thought
        Freda might have given him some better reward than a scolding, a glass of
        milk, and a bath, and took pains to be very kind to him herself, and find
        something to talk about more interesting than groans at the heat. Freda herself
        was really pleased and touched by both marks of affection ; but her Scotch
        pride forbade her appropriating either, the latter especially, as a personal
        compliment. Lochaber''s tail never recovered the catastophe, and all experi
        ments made with a view of finding out whether a false one could be induced
        to stay on, proved total failures. Time, however, aided by judicious cutting
        and grooming, gradually diminished the peculiarity of his appearance. Freda
        carried her point, and was allowed to ride him again, look how he might. Arnold
        persisted in calling him Air. Chickely, after the gentleman in " Aliddlemarch
        " who had " a few hairs carefully arranged ; " and certainly no valet to an
        ancient fop ever laboured more scrupulously to shew off every hair his master
        had left to the best advantage, than cUd Dick to make the most of all that
        remained to Lochaber. To Freda''s great satisfaction, the perpetrators of
        the deed were never discovered. Her children faithfully obeyed her, and pushed
        no inquiries. If the act was intended as an injury to her cause, malice certainly
        " o''erleaped itself, and fell on t''other side," for the general sympathy
        excited was a powerful agent toward lessening any opposition to her attempts.
        The hot month of January passed away, and still there were two more hot months
        to follow ; but Australian heat is not distressing when the wind is south

        A Story of the Roman Invasion. By G. A. Hentt. With 12 page Illustrations
        by W. Parkinson. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6s. This story deals
        with the invasion ot Britain by the Roman legionaries. Beric, who is a boy-chief
        of a British tribe, takes a prominent part in the insurrection under Boadicea:
        and after the defeat of that heroic queen (in A.D. 62) he continues the struggle
        in the fen-country. Ultimately Beric is defeated and carried captive to Rome,
        where he is trained in the exercise of arms in a school of gladiators. Such
        is the skill which he there acquires that he succeeds in saving a Christian
        maid by slaying a lion in the arena, and is rewarded by being made librarian
        in the palace, and the personal protector of Nero. Finally he escapes from
        this irksome service, organizes a band of outlaws in Calabria, defies the
        power of Rome, and at length returns to Britain, where he becomes a wise ruler

        and a Map. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6s. A large part of this
        story deals with the revolt of the Greeks, in 1821, against Turkish oppression.
        Mr. Beveridge and his son Horace, like most Englishmen at that time, are stirred
        with enthusiasm for the down-trodden nation. So they fit out a privateer,
        load it with military stores, and set sail for Greece to assist the insurgents.
        On their arrival, however, they find that the leaders of the insurrection
        are a cowardly, thieving, blood thirsty crew. So they resolve to hold aloof
        from politics, and give all possible assistance to the victims of war, both
        Greeks and Turks. They rescue the Christians who are beleaguered in the island
        of Cyprus, assist the Turkish garrison in Athens, relieve the captive Greeks
        who are being sent to the slave markets, destroy Turkish shipping, and fight
        the Turkish war vessels. The story is full of stirring adventure, and will
        delight the boy who loves the sea, and the hazards of seafaring. A', 1]

        and James Van Horn, Cashier. There are three public halls. The Loller Lodge
        of Odd Fellows owns a good stone building three stories high, which makes
        a good appearance on York Road. This Order has also an excellent stone hall
        at Huntingdon Valley, a few miles distant. The Hatboro Lodge Building was
        erected in 1851. " The W. K. Bray Lodge of Masons met in Jones'' Hall. The
        Patriotic Sons of America also possess an organization. " It is said that
        the place owes its name to " one of the first stone houses built here, which
        was about 1705, and in which, shortly after, John Dawson followed for many
        years his occupation of making hats. The English hatter left a mark in his
        name lasting longer than the name placed in hats denoting the maker. This
        building likewise became a tavern, and had for its sign a crooked billet,
        suggested by a popular inn then kept in Water Street, Philadelphia. It stood
        near the center of the present town, on the Old York Road, where is now the
        dwelling house of Oliver AVatson, and into which, on being modernized, a portion
        was incorporated. " John Dawson lived here in 1734, and a Daniel Dawson was
        also a resident of the place. " Lewis Evans''s map of Pennsylvania and the
        adjoining provinces, published in 1749 " calls the place " Hatboro. " " Franklin''s
        Pennsylvania Gazette of October 12, 1752, " styles it " Crooked Billet. "
        The records of the library in 1755 use " Hatbor ough, " though the meetings
        are named as held at the house of " David Reese, at ye Crooked Billet. " This
        was an English name for inns, probably imported to this country. Nicholas
        Scull''s map of Pennsylvania, in 1759 calls the place "Billet," as does William
        Scull''s map 1770. Washington, writing to Congress in 1777 names the " Billet
        tavern. " General Lacy, 1778 gives the place the name " Crooked Billet, "
        as do Majors Simcoe and Stedman, who were British officers in the skirmish
        here. Reading Howell, in his town ship map of 1792 calls it '' Hatborough,
        '' and also Joseph Scott, in his Gazetteer of 1795. " Mr. Buck concludes that
        Hatboro was the name of the village, and Billet, or Crooked Billet of the
        tavern. In 1720 a road from Byberry to Horsham was laid out through the center
        of Hatboro. The part east of York Avenue is Byberry Avenue, and that west
        is Moreland Avenue. "The County Line Road, leading from the present toll-gate
        to Graeme Park, was laid out in 1722. " There must have been some settlement
        to require a road additional to the York Road. David Reese kept the tavern
        in 1759. His daughter Rebecca married "John Hart, of AVarminster. " In 1761

        and he was librarian for some time. He had a farm. In 1786 AVilliam Todd bought
        " Tomkins'' share in the library. " In 1784 Abraham Duffield had a public
        house " in the lower part of the village. " The library was here for some
        time, John J. Marple owned and kept this inn " at least from 1814 to 1825.

        only a short time. Rev. Air. Boyer and AVm. P. Taylor (lay-reader), became
        the main supplies of the Mission, and the services were very acceptable to
        the neighborhood. The Third Sunday in Advent, December 16th, 1888, Air. Alason
        began regular services in this Alission of the Germantown Convocation, under
        the Deanship of Dr. James De Wolfe Perry. The worship was conducted in Alelrose
        Hall through the kindness of Mr. T. Henry Asbury. Perseverance and loving
        devotion have developed the work in a com munity offering grand opportunities
        for the future. A Ladies'' Guild gave aid to the parish, and made up a Lenten

        Dr. Edward Appleton, Rector of St. Paul''s Church, Cheltenham. Airs. Clara

        Mr. Earle was Secretary of the Sunday School, and Air. Latourette and Mr.

        one year, " which " offer was thankfully accepted. " John Fitch was a member
        of the library in 1778. In 1780 the library was in Wm. Wilson''s house, and
        under his care. Mrs. Fergusson, of Graeme Park, gave fifty volumes to the
        library. In 1787 an act of incorporation was passed. Nathan Holt, of Horsham,
        died in 1848, and gave " most of his property for the benefit of the library
        company. " He had received much benefit in using the books of the society.
        Thirty-eight hundred dollars of the $5,800 bequeathed by Mr. Holt was used
        in the erection of the neat stone building which was finished in 1849, and
        which in its quiet and classic beauty now adorns the Old York Road. Its appearance
        invites one to quiet study and reflection, and here is spread a mental banquet
        richer than a bodily feast. John Sloan, of Philadelphia, was the architect
        of the building, and Joseph B. Yerkes was appointed to superintend its construction.
        It stands on an acre lot bought of Robert Radcliff in 1848 for $400. The books
        were placed in the new building in 1850, and the former building " was directed
        to be sold. " In 1855, Chas. H. Hill, Wm. J. Buck and David Newport were appointed
        a com mittee concerning a commemoration of the centennial of the library though
        the plan was not carried out by reason of certain conditions imposed on the
        committee. There are over 10,000 volumes in the library. The directors at
        the time of Mr. Buck''s account were A. L. Philips, Edward Reading, John B.
        Carrell, and Mrs. Jane E. Carr was librarian. She held the post for ten years.
        There are rare works on the shelves of this library printed between " 1593
        and 1730, and one hundred and thirteen volumes relating to the history of
        America printed before 1800. " There is also a cabinet of curiosities. This
        is the oldest library in the County. Mr. Buck thus closes : " An institution
        of this nature flourishing so long through voluntary efforts speaks well for
        the intelligence of the neighborhood. " I will add that the pamphlet printed
        in 1889 states that Wm. J. Buck, John Christopher and Samuel Horner have donated
        Indian relics. The fine yard, with its neat iron fence and the Grecian pillared
        front of the building and its nicely kept interior are a credit to the toAvn.

        time immemo rial by the residents of Bustleton going and returning from church.
        On a vacant lot on the road leading from the Turnpike to the St. Luke''s school
        were the remains of an old distillery. It was or had been a three-story stone
        building, and was then a ruin ; nothing but the walls were left, a fire having
        consumed everything combustible. The present building now used as the St.
        Luke''s school has been enlarged; but when I went to school to Mr. Neville,
        over fifty years ago, there was a tradition of the neighborhood that, at that
        building, for years there had been a very large and prosperous Acad emy, and
        its suspension no doubt induced Air. Neville to remove from Somer ville, N.
        J., and locate in Bustleton. Bustleton, one hundred years ago, was distinguished
        for the number of famous men in science, art, religion, statesmanship and
        manufacture. Pennypack Church is distinguished as being the second oldest
        Baptist Church in America, built in the seventeenth century, and until about
        1835 was the only church building within four or five miles. Byberry Aleeting,
        All Saints and Oxford Church were the nearest. A large circulating library
        was in existence for many years, with about two thousand volumes of the best
        standard works on all subjects. Air. Enoch C. Edwards, the son of a distinguished
        physician of the village, was the librarian. The second story of his store,
        where the post-office is now located, was the library, and the neighbors valued
        its advantages and liberally patron ized it. The village was also distinguished
        for having one of the oldest, if not the best calico-printing establishment
        in this State at least. It was located on the Pennypack Creek, adjoining the
        village, and was built and conducted by AVendell Perkins & Co. They employed
        one hundred or two hundred men, and had four or five four-horse teams to transport
        their goods to and from the city. They were successful for many years, but
        other locations nearer the market and improved machinery drove them out of
        the market. In addition to the Academies and schools located in Bustleton,
        Dr. Samuel Jones, pastor of Pennypack Church, a graduate of the Pennsylvania
        Univer sity, had a school or college for preparing young men for the ministry.
        He lived about one mile from the village, adjoining the church. He was a man
        of high character and was much respected. AVhilst he was the pastor of the
        Pennypack Church, he was active in starting the Union College of Rhode Island,
        and was offered the first Presidency of that institution (now Brown University).
        John Comly was partly educated under his instructions, in the classics at
        least. John AVatts, a resident of that neighborhood, was also dis tinguished
        as one of Pennsylvania''s surveyors, and aided in running the Mason and Dixon
        Line, and for two or three generations persons of the same name had been surveyors
        and schoolmasters of that neighborhood. Air. Samuel Swift, who lived on the
        Turnpike near Bell''s Corners, was a great student and extensive farmer.',

        \ given to the convent by those great prelates, William de St Carileph, Hugh\
        \ Pudsey, and Cardinal Langley. Many of these MSS. were written at Durham.\
        \ One of the most learned men who ever held the office of librarian here,\
        \ Thomas Rud, to whom we are indebted for an invaluable catalogue of the MSS.,\
        \ held that every volume which bears the inscription, \" Liber Sancti Cuthberti,\"\
        \ proceeded from the pen of some Durham scribe. The words referred to occur\
        \ in a large propor tion ofthe MSS. Dr. Waagen, who visited Durham in order\
        \ to study the miniatures in the MSS. preserved here, says, \"This study con\
        \ vinced me that a school of miniature painting existed at Durham for several\
        \ centuries of the Middle Ages, which devoted itself more to the practice\
        \ of beautiful decorations than to the representation of scenes with figures.\
        \ By this means, however, a rare degree of taste and an admirable technical\
        \ manner were developed.\" Several ancient catalogues of the monastic library\
        \ still exist. By their means we are enabled to estimate the losses which\
        \ have been sustained since the time of their compilation, chiefly, no doubt,\
        \ at the Reformation, and we have also the means of forming some idea of the\
        \ character of monkish study and learning in such a convent as that of Durham.\
        \ The oldest of these catalogues was prepared in the early part of the twelfth\
        \ century. The later ones were compiled near the end of the fourteenth century.\
        \ From these we learn that the books were then kept in various places. The\
        \ bulk of them were preserved in the two compartments into which the old Treasury\
        \ was then as now divided. Others were deposited in cases in various parts\
        \ of the Cloister; some in the north alley for the ordinary use of the monks,\
        \ some near the Treasury door for the use of the novices, and some again near\
        \ the door leading into the Common room, for the use of the monk who read\
        \ to his brethren whilst they dined. About the year 1416 the books previously\
        \ kept in the Treasury were removed into the then newly-erected Library over\
        \ the Parlour. There they remained until the completion of Dean Sudbury's\
        \ Library, about 1685. Many of them still bear traces of the neglect, to use\
        \ no stronger term, with which they have been treated, and there is a well\
        \ known but probably fabulous tradition which credits the nurse em ployed\

        \ an inscription which says, that whoever should alienate it would incur the\

        \ the secrets of the house are written.\" The books lent to Bek, eight in\
        \ number, were valued at \xA3200. Two of them he brought into court, asserting\
        \ that the rest were in London, and promising to return them. It is curious\
        \ to find the Archbishop of York writing in 1436 to the Prior of Durham, asking\
        \ for the loan of the book known as The Pastils of Hugh of Vienna, and the\
        \ prior replying that there was a better written copy of the book in question\
        \ \" in our college at Oxford than in our monastery at Durham,\" and that\
        \ this would be lent to the archbishop on his application to its custodian.\
        \ In 1454 the prior writes to the Bishop of Durham in answer to an application\
        \ for the loan of Pliny and Isidore De Naturis Rerum, saying he had caused\
        \ the catalogues of the library to be strictly searched, and had found that\
        \ the convent did not possess the books asked for. Mr. Edward Edwards, than\

        \ in the Vulgate, there are several entire copies, and a multitude of portions\

        \ and Beda \u2014 (several copies of each are entered) \u2014 and even a larger\

        \ site of the great abbey which he reared by the mouth of the Wear. His youth\
        \ was trained, and his long, tranquil life was wholly spent, at Jarrow, in\
        \ an offshoot of Bene dict's house, which was founded by his friend Ceolfrid.\

        \ scholar of his ; and how the two stoutly kept up the sendee, and, dropping\
        \ only the antiphons, struggled through the psalms amidst much sobbing and\
        \ weeping, till the rest of the brethren were suffi ciently instructed in\
        \ the church chant to suffer the whole service to be restored. B\xE6da never\

        or even the most ornamental parts of the valley of the Thames above London.

        number of the slaves increased until the cultivation of the soil, formerly
        considered the most honor able of labor and fit only for Roman citizens, was
        done by slaves. When Carthage was captured, nearly all of her people were

        the enslaved people were sold at auction. Slave-traders were very numerous
        and amassed immense wealth. We have no difficulty in understanding this when
        we remember that these traders bought in the camps at sixty-two cents and
        then spld in Rome at prices seldom less than one hun dred dollars for a slave.5

        C. Walker, Principal Librarian, Public Library. The Board having ascertained
        the nature of the documents at the disposal of the Government, came to the
        conclusion that the design with which the publication of the Official History
        was commenced could not be fully carried out unless the State Papers and other
        official documents upon which the work was based were made as accessible to
        the public as the History itself. They therefore recommended, in the month
        of March, 1891, that the publication of the Records was not only desirable
        but necessary. The proposal received the approval of the then Colonial Treasurer,
        the Hon. William McMillan, who gave the necessary authority to carry out the
        work, on the lines recommended by the Board. Arrange ments were made, accordingly,
        for printing and publishing the despatches, reports, letters and other papers
        which had been collected. While the best use has been made of the material
        at command, the Records of the early days of the Colony cannot be presented
        in an absolutely complete form. Every paper of consequence that has been discovered,
        or may be discovered hereafter, will be published * but unfortunately manuscripts
        of great interest and importance, which are known to have existed, cannot
        now be found. The most valuable of the early Records are the despatches sent
        to England by the Governors, and the despatches received by the Governors
        from the authorities in London. At Govern ment House, Sydney, there are a
        number of letter-books contain ing copies of the despatches sent to England,
        and the original despatches received from the Home authorities; but these
        Records, instead of going back to 1788, the year in which New South Wales
        was founded, begin with 1800. Of the despatches received and sent before that
        date, during the Governorships of Phillip and Hunter, and the Lieutenant-Governorships
        of Grose and Paterson, there is no trace. What has become of them it is impossible
        to say. A hundred years ago State Papers were not so carefully guarded as
        they are now ; the English system was loose, and it would have been surprising
        if greater care had been taken in Sydney than in London. Some of the early

        entry refer ring to the victims of warfare is one of July 12, 1601. It concerns
        the wives and children of the men of the three Zealand companies at Ostend.
        These left as soon as the enemy opened fire (July 5), some going back later.
        They were gefouriert or billeted by lot amongst the towns of Zealand, those
        of Joost de Chantraine''s, dit Bruxsaulx, at Middelburg, Charles Rassaert''s
        at Flushing, and Zegelin de Rolle''s at Veere. The same day is entered a request
        from '' Doctor Medicus,'' Cor. van Nieuwenhoven at Ostend, for medicines and
        an apothecary''s assistant. He is referred to M. Alleman, one of those deputed
        to Middelburg by the States-General. On July 27 the surgeons at Ostend write
        for old linen. On the 30th the authorities of the hospital at Middelburg represent
        to the States the many wounded coming daily from Ostend, to the number already
        of 200, and that it is not possible for them to attend to them for want of
        accommodation and funds, &c. Further, that the hospital at Flushing is also
        full (with 80 wounded). The States thereupon decide to hire some warehouses,
        where the badly wounded shall be taken care of at the general cost (i.e. at
        1 The distance from Ostend to Flushing is just under thirty nautical miles,
        so, under the most favourable circumstances, the sea voyage could not be done
        under five or six hours. Sir W. Browne, in his letter July 22, says he distinctly
        heard the firing. 2 In 1809 Flushing was bombarded by the British fleet, and

        AND SONGS. There are several in the special catalogues of Dr. W. P. C. Knuttel,
        one of the officials of the Royal Library at The Hague, and of M. Louis D.
        Petit, the Librarian of the University of Leyden. The latter kindly called
        my attention to the large collection of plans of Ostend left by the late M.
        Bodel. There is no lack of pasquinades in the contemporary records, but I
        have failed to discover anything about Ostend, either in Shakespeare, who
        left the stage in 1604, or in the Dutch poet, Jacob Cats, who resided at Middelburg
        till 1606. Neither can, however, have been indifferent to such an all-engrossing
        topic ; but New Troy is still awaiting its Homer. The following is a song
        of the period (1604), which exists in print in the library at The Hague. It

        \ to their wants, and the number of their families, in sums varying from 3s.\
        \ to 14s. in amount. From the appointment of the first Charity Trustees, in\
        \ 1835, the same mode of distribution was continued. Mr. James Dunnington,\

        \ their Annual Meeting at Ripon. By kind permission of the Dean and Chapter\
        \ of Ripon Cathedral, sections of the ringers rang a number of peals on the\
        \ Cathedral bells, the Birstal and Guiseley ringers being the first. The remaining\

        \ Rev. H. D. Cust Nunn, Vicar and Rural Dean. The peals during the day were\

        \ ballad, J. H. Wiffen, was a member of the Society of Friends. In 1812, in\
        \ conjunction with two friends \u2014 Dr. Brown, of the Inner Temple, and\
        \ Dr. Raffles, of Liverpool\u2014 he published some of his efforts in a volume\
        \ entitled \"Poems by Three Friends.\" Seven years after wards this volume\
        \ was succeeded by another, of greater merit. Appointed by the Duke of Bedford\
        \ librarian at Woburn Abbey, he resided there until his death in 1836, at\
        \ the age of forty-four. His principal prose work was entitled \" Historical\
        \ Memoirs of the House of Russell.\" The following ballad was first published\
        \ in \"The Literary Souvenir.\" It is founded upon a popular superstition,\
        \ and a family tradition connected with the Musgraves, of Eden Hall, Cumberland.\
        \ The Musgraves, who have been settled in Cumberland since the time of the\
        \ Conqueror, for ages preserved an old drinking-glass, enamelled in colours,\
        \ called the Luck of Eden Hall. If this had been broken, the house and family\
        \ would have been brought to ruin. According to tradition, the glass was seized\
        \ by a company of fairies, when, after vigorous efforts for its recovery,\
        \ it vanished into thin air. Uhland wrote a ballad upon the same subject,\
        \ which has been translated by Longfellow ; but the German poet records the\
        \ breaking of the glass, and the consequent destruction of the mansion. N\
        \ Eden's wild romantic bowers The summer moonbeams sweetly fall, And tint\
        \ with yellow light the towers \u2014 The stately towers of Eden Hall. There,\
        \ lonely in the deepening night, A lady at her lattice sits, And trims her\
        \ taper's wavering light, And tunes her idle lute by fits. But little can\
        \ her idle lute Beguile the weary moments now ; And little seems the lay to\
        \ suit Her wistful eye and anxious brow. For, as the chord her finger sweeps,\
        \ Ofttimes she checks her simple song, To chide the forward chance that keeps\
        \ Lord Musgrave from her arms so long ; And listens, as the wind sweeps by,\
        \ His steed's familiar step to hear. Peace ! beating heart \u2014 'twas but\
        \ the cry And footfall of the distant deer. In, lady, to thy bower ; fast\
        \ weep The chill dews on thy cheek so pale ; Thy cherished hero lies asleep\
        \ \u2014 Asleep in distant Rossendale !", 1]

        A Story of the Roman Invasion. By Gr. A. Henty. With 12 page Illustrations
        by W. Parkinson. Crown Svo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6s. This story deals
        with the invasion of Britain by the Roman legionaries. Beric, who is a boy-chief
        of a British tribe, takes a prominent part in the insurrection under Boadicea:
        and after the defeat of that heroic queen (in A.D. 62) he continues the struggle
        in the fen-country. Ultimately Beric is defeated and carried captive to Rome,
        where he is trained in the exercise of arms in a school of gladiators. Such
        is the skill which he there acquires that he succeeds in saving a Christian
        maid by slaying a lion in the arena, and is rewarded by being made librarian
        in the palace, and the personal protector of Nero. Finally he escapes from
        this irksome service, organizes a band of outlaws in Calabria, defies the
        power of Rome, and at length returns to Britain, where he becomes a wise ruler
        of his own people. In Greek Waters: A Story of the Grecian War of Inde- pendence
        (1821-1827). By G. A. Henty. With 12 page Illus trations by W. S. Stacey,
        and a Map. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 6s. A large part of this
        story deals with the revolt of the Greeks, in 1821, against Turkish oppression.
        Mr. Beveridge and his son Horace, like most Englishmen at that time, are stirred
        with enthusiasm for the down-trodden nation. So they fit out a privateer,
        load it with military stores, and set sail for Greece to assist the insurgents.
        On their arrival, however, they find that the leaders of the insurrection
        are a cowardly, thieving, blood thirsty crew. So they resolve to hold aloof
        from politics, and give all possible assistance to the victims of war, both
        Greeks and Turks. They rescue the Christians who are beleaguered in the island
        of Cyprus, assist the Turkish garrison in Athens, relieve the captive Greeks
        who are being sent to the slave markets, destroy Turkish shipping, and fight
        the Turkish war vessels. The story is full of stirring adventure, and will
        delight the boy who loves the sea, and the hazards of seafaring. A', 1]

        moon suffers a real loss by not receiving the sun''s light, through which
        it is enabled to dispel our darkness." '' " After the writing of this epistle,"
        says Dr. Healy,2 " we lose sight of Dungal for several years. Charlemagne
        died in 814, and was succeeded by his son, Louis the Pious, and on the 31st
        July, 8 1 7, Louis associated with himself his son Lothair in the imperial
        government. Lothair, young and energetic, was crowned King of Lombardy in
        821, and in the next year pro ceeded to put his kingdom in order. The warlike
        Lombards, though conquered by Charlemagne, and kept in restraint by his strong
        arm, were a restless and turbulent people. Lothair, trusting in the power
        of education and religion, induced Dungal and Claudius of Turin, as well as
        several other scholars of the imperial court or the famous Palace school,
        to accompany him to Italy. Claudius, a Spaniard by birth, was made Bishop
        of Turin, and Dungal the Irishman was placed at the head of the school at
        Pavia." At the close of the eighth century the war with the Icono clasts had
        spread from Constantinople to Italy ; this was some years before Dungal was
        established at Pavia, but as in the year 825 he took an active part in the
        contest, we must retrace our steps, and say a few words here on the history
        of this movement. About the year 790, Pope Hadrian is said to have sent to
        Charlemagne a Latin translation of the Acts of the Synod at Nice, held in
        ySj, written originally in Greek, of which Charle magne''s copy was an inaccurate
        translation.3 At this synod the Council accepted the teaching propounded by
        Hadrian I. in 1 " Ireland''s Ancient Schools," J. Healy, D.D., p. 384. 2 Op.
        cit., p. 384. 3 The Latin translation of the Acts of the Synod at Nice appears
        to have been imperfect. Anastasius, the Roman librarian, declares that the
        trans lator knew very little of the genius either of the Greek or of the Latin
        language. The learned men summoned by Charlemagne, at whose head was Alcuin,
        found in this translation many things to censure in which they were right,
        and many other things they censured in which they were clearly wrong. The
        result of their labours in the matter is contained in the famous Caroline
        Books. They were published under the name of Charles himself, but Alcuin is
        generally regarded as the real author.', 1]

        those which have been the curse of Egypt are ancient enough to satisfy the
        most ardent admirer of whatever has antiquity on its side. A poem can be read
        on the walls of the great temple of Luxor which was composed in laudation
        of Rameses the Great. The author was Pentatour, who flourished three thousand
        years ago. A letter written by him to Ameneman, the monarch''s chief librarian,
        has also been preserved, and runs thus : " Have you ever represented to yourself
        in imagination the state of the rustic who tills the ground ? Before he has
        put the sickle to the crop the locusts have blighted part thereof; then come
        the rats and the birds. If he is slack in housing his crop the thieves are
        on him. His horse dies of weariness as it drags the wain. The tax-collector
        arrives ; his agents are armed with clubs ; he has negroes with him who carry
        whips of palm branches. They all cry, '' Give us your grain,'' and he has
        no way of avoiding their extortionate demands. Next, the wretch is caught,
        bound and sent off to work, without wage, at the canals ; his wives are taken
        and chained ; his children are stripped and plundered." This gloomy picture
        of life in Egypt during the reign of Rameses the Great might have been painted
        when Ismail was its ruler. The methods had not changed after the lapse of
        three thousand years, the rest of the world having been transformed during
        the interval. If Ismail had been allowed to continue on the throne, the iniquitous

        directed that scolds were to be presented by the Mayor on a " cuck-stool "

        in his History of Leicester, that there was at that time a Cucking-stool kept
        somewhere about the Town Hall premises, and adds that '' to the credit of

        \ ponders on the destinies of a people whose very existence seems now to have\
        \ been almost as fanciful as the magical creations in one of their own fairy-tales.\
        \ Notwithstanding the history of the Arabs is so intimately connected with\
        \ that of the Spaniards that it may be justly said to form the reverse side\
        \ of it, and notwithstanding the amplitude of authentic documents in the Arabic\

        \ the most eminent, until the latter half of the last cen- tury, with an inseniibility\
        \ which can be im- puted to nothing but a spirit of religious bigotry, have\
        \ been content to derive their narratives exclusively from national autho-\
        \ rities. A fire which occurred in the Escurial in mil having consumed more\
        \ than three- quarters of the magnificent collection of Eastern manuscripts\
        \ which it contained, the Spanish government, taking some shame to itself,\
        \ as it would appear, for its past supine- ness, caused a copious catalogue\
        \ of the sur- viving volumes, to the number of 1850, to be compiled by the\
        \ learned Casiri ; and the re- sult was his celebrated work, \"Bibliotheca\
        \ Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis,\" which ap- peared in the years 1760-70,\
        \ and which would reflect credit from the splendour of its typo- graphical\
        \ execution on any press of the pre- sent day. This work, although censured\
        \ by some later Orientalists as hasty and super- ficial, must ever be highly\
        \ valued as affording the only complete index to the rich repertory of Arabic\
        \ manuscripts in the Escurial, and for the ample evidence which it exhibits\
        \ of the science and mental culture of the Spanish Arabs. Several other native\
        \ scholars, among whom Andres and Masdeu may be particu larly noticed, have\
        \ made extensive researches into the literary history of this people. Still\
        \ their political history, so essential to a correct knowledge of the Spanish,\
        \ was comparatively neglected, until Sefior Conde, the late learned librarian\
        \ of the Academy, who had given ample evidence of his Oriental learning in\
        \ his Tersion and illustrations of the Nubian Geo grapher, and a Dissertation\
        \ on Arabic Coins published in the fifth volume of the Memoirs ofthe Royal\
        \ Academy of History, compiled his work entitled \" Hi&toria de la Dominacion\
        \ de los Arabes en Espana.\" The first volume appeared in 1820. But unhappily\
        \ the death of its author, occurring in the autumn of the same year, prevented\
        \ the completion of his design. The two remaining volumes, how ever, were\
        \ printed in the course of that and the following year from his own manuscripts\
        \ ; and, although their comparative meagreness and confused chronology betray\
        \ the want of the same paternal hand, they contain much interesting information.\
        \ The relation of the conquest of Granada, especially, with which the work\
        \ concludes, exhibits some important particulars in a totally different point\
        \ of view from that in which they had been presented by the principal Spanish\
        \ historians. The first volume, which may be conBidered1 as having received\
        \ the last touches ,of its author, embraces a circumstantial narrative of\
        \ the great Saracen invasion, of the sub- sequent condition of Spain under\
        \ the Viceroys, and of the empire of the Omeyades; un- doubtedly the most\
        \ splendid portion of the Arabian annals, but the one, unluckily, which has\
        \ been most copiously illustrated in the popular work compiled by Cardonne\
        \ from the Oriental manuscripts in the Royal Library at Paris. But, as this\
        \ author has followed the Spanish and the Oriental authorities indis- criminately,\
        \ no part of his book can be cited as a genuine Arabic version, except indeed\
        \ the last sixty pages, comprising the conquest of Granada, which Cardonne\
        \ professes in his Preface to have drawn exclusively from an Arabic manuscript.\
        \ Conde, on the other hand, professes to have adhered to his ori- ginals with\
        \ such scrupulous fidelity that the \" European reader may feel that he is\
        \ perus- ing an Arabian author ; \" and certainly very strong internal evidence\
        \ is afforded of the truth of this assertion, in the peculiar na- tional and\
        \ religious spirit which pervades the work, and in a certain florid gasconade\
        \ of style, common with the Oriental writers. It is this fidelity that constitutes\
        \ the peculiar value of Conde's narrative. It is the first time that the Arabians,\
        \ at least those of Spain, \u2014 the part of the nation which reached the\
        \ highest degree of refinement, \u2014 have been allowed to speak for themselves.\
        \ The his tory, or rather tissue of histories, embodied in the translation,\

        \ reader on subjects of policy and government. The nar rative is, moreover,\
        \ encumbered with fri volous details and a barren muster-roll of names and\
        \ titles, which would better become a genealogical table than a history. But,\

        \ Filelfo began his course of lessons again, but it was a sort of swan's song.\
        \ It was easy to foresee his approach ing death,1 and Lorenzo did not lose\
        \ much in offering him a golden bridge. It was not this aged man of learning\
        \ who reflected glory upon the feeble Studio of Florence, but Landino, Chalcondyle,\
        \ Bartolommeo Fonte, already celebrated, though to-day obscure,2 and above\
        \ all, Angelo Ambrogini of Montepulciano, who, according to the fashion of\
        \ the day, called himself Poliziano, after his native town (1454\u201494).\
        \ An erudite philologist and philosopher of Ficino's school, he was more of\
        \ a poet than any of his contemporaries, and made his name by poetry. He secured\
        \ it by a harmonious poem in the vulgar tongue, in which he celebrated Giuliano's\
        \ victory in a tournament in 1475, and which he dedicated to the survivor\
        \ of the two brothers.3 Before the poem was finished the author became Lorenzo's\
        \ secretary and librarian, the tutor of his children, and was lodged in the\
        \ palace free of all cost. The end achieved, he renounced the idea of finishing\
        \ the work.4 His 1 Filelfo was reinstalled in his chair July 15, 1481. He\

        \ concerns a joust that took place at Florence in 1475, and which must not\
        \ be confused with that of 1469, in which Lorenzo was conqueror, and was described\

        \ the morning out of their recollections. Shocked at his situation, Stephen\
        \ Dumpling took the white-legged chestnut to Duncan Nevin, but though that\
        \ worthy admitted that he was varry like the field, neither his long tail,\
        \ nor his flowing mane, would induce him to offer more than twenty-five pounds\
        \ for him. \" I really have more horses than I can do with,\" repeated Mr.\

        \ thousand dollars from the late George B. Dorr, of Boston, and in 1878, three\
        \ thousand dollars from the executor of the late George J. Foster. In 1880,\
        \ twelve thousand dollars were received from the estate of Mrs. Mary M. Keese.\
        \ The largest and most munificent gift the library has ever received was that\
        \ of Mrs. Sarah H. Green, of fifty thousand dollars from the estate of her\
        \ late husband, John C. Green, of which the income alone is to be used for\
        \ the purchase of books (one half for illustrated works on art for the \"\
        John C. Green Alcove,\" and one half for books for circulation). Since the\
        \ Revolution the librarians have been Isaac L. Kipp, 1793-4; John Forbes,\
        \ 1794-1824 ; Burtis Skidm ore, 1824-1828 ; and Philip J. Forbes (son of John\

        \ members of the New-York Society Library have been, from its foundation,\
        \ among the most prominent, wealthy, and respectable citizens of New-York.\
        \ Many of the origi nal shares of 1754-58 have been handed down in the same\

        \ schools, collected in 1820 a library which was made accessible to the public\
        \ the following year in its build ing in Chambers street. In 1832 the society\
        \ removed to 472 Broad way, where it remained until its present quarters at\

        \ John Pintard, to whom, more than to any other one man, perhaps, is the seminary\
        \ library indebted. Additions were made with considerable regularity, the\
        \ number of volumes reported each year showing a gratifying in crease; the\
        \ total in 1836 being 5000, half of which were folios and quartos. About this\
        \ time an effort was made to establish a perma nent fund, and the special\
        \ committee on the increase of the library secured ten thousand dollars, four\
        \ thousand dollars being for im mediate use, and the balance for an endowment.\
        \ The subscriptions to the fund were quite general, the largest being that\
        \ of the corporation of Trinity Church, which also contributed a number of\
        \ books. In 1851, with a total of 10,512 volumes in the collection, the librarian\
        \ reported : \" The library has been open daily for the consultation of books,\
        \ and semi-weekly for the delivery of them.\" At this time the alumni of the\
        \ seminary who resided within ten miles of the city were granted the same\
        \ privileges as the students ; this regulation was abolished in 1874, when\
        \ the removal of the library disclosed the fact that nearly a thousand books\
        \ were missing. When the seminary was removed from New Haven to New-York,\
        \ the books were taken to the belfry chamber of St. John's Chapel, and kept\
        \ there until the new free school should be completed. The East Building (the\
        \ first erected by the General Seminary, and de molished in 1892) was occupied\
        \ in 1827, and here the library re mained until 1874. The steadily increasing\
        \ number of books made the accommodation more and more overcrowded, and the\
        \ value of the collection was so great that in 1852-53 the trustees were strongly\
        \ urged to provide a fire-proof room for them. The appointment by the trustees\
        \ of a committee to secure funds to erect a library building of proper size\
        \ and construction followed, but subscriptions were hard to obtain, and in\
        \ 1854 the committee was discharged, having accom plished nothing. In 1874,\
        \ when the number of volumes was reported as 15,132, the confusion resulting\
        \ from overcrowding was so great that some change was imperatively demanded,\
        \ and the books were carried over to the West Building, from which they were\
        \ taken, in 1885, to Hobart Hall. Here, with some alterations which can easily\
        \ be made in Jarvis Hall adjoining, shelving for 100,000 volumes can be placed,\
        \ so that the library seems at last to have found a permanent home. That it\
        \ is a valuable and useful collection is well known to many besides those\
        \ associated with the seminary; mention can only be made, however, of a few\
        \ of the more important works. The four great Polyglots may be found here\
        \ \u2014 the Complutensian, Le Jay's (the Paris), the Antwerp, and Walton's.\
        \ The first two were given by Mr. Pintard. There are also many valuable Bibles\

        \ of New-York, and will prove to be a per manent benefit and source of profit\
        \ to art students. The corridor of the picture-gallery contains a number of\
        \ statues and busts by Crawford, Gibson, Powers, Pampeloni, Rauch, Pozzi,\
        \ Spence, and Sir John Steel (who is represented by two noble busts of Chalmers\
        \ and Sir Walter Scott). Crawford's \"Children in the Wood\" and Spence's\
        \ \"Highland Mary,\" both executed to order for Mr. Lenox in Rome, are interesting\
        \ and attractive examples of those artists. The pictures are well hung in\
        \ the finest apartment as yet dedicated to art in this city. Among the foreign\
        \ artists represented are Constable, Calcott, Delaroche, Gainsborough, Escosura,\
        \ Landseer, Morland, Mulready, Nasmyth, Newton, Ruysdael, Reynolds, Turner,\
        \ Vernet, Webster, and Sir David Wilkie. American art is also well represented\
        \ by Bierstadt, Church, Copley, Durand, Inman, Leslie, Huntington, Jarvis,\
        \ Peale, Stuart, Vanderlyn, and others. The most important of the one hundred\
        \ and forty-three pictures painted by the above-mentioned masters are the\
        \ three Reynoldses. The full length of Mrs. Billington as Saint Cecilia is\
        \ a noble example of Sir Joshua. The same may be said of the portrait of Miss\
        \ Kitty Fisher, but unfortunately it is somewhat faded. Of equal importance\
        \ are the two Turners. No. 86, representing a scene on the French coast, with\
        \ an English man-of-war stranded, is a superb picture, while Fingal's Cave\
        \ is still finer ; it is fully described and highly praised in the memoirs\
        \ of the artist Leslie, who purchased it for Mr. Lenox from Turner. The examples\

        \ of Napoleon by Delaroche, in the collection of the late Marshall O. Roberts\
        \ of New-York. Both the Copleys are good, particularly the portrait of Lady\
        \ Wentworth ; and there are several valuable Stuarts, including one of his\

        \ of Charles M. da Costa, a trustee of the college. The estate of Dr. Frederick\

        \ library, founded in 1890 by Samuel P. Avery of this city, in memory of his\
        \ son, Henry Ogden Avery. This collection, entirely the gift of Mr. Avery,\

        the other opposing, the Astor Place Opera House (which had been the scene
        in 1849 of the conflict between the friends of the rival actors Edwin Forrest
        and William Charles Macready) was purchased. The cost of this build ing was
        $140,000. About $115,000 more was expended in adapting it for the purpose
        of the library. The association took possession and moved the books into the
        building in April, 1854. At this time the library possessed 43,000 volumes,
        and the capacity of the building was estimated at 120,000 volumes. After an
        occupancy of thirty-six years, and when the allotted room for books had for
        many years been crowded and every available spot utilized, and the development
        of the library greatly retarded for want of room, this building was vacated
        in April, 1890, in order that it might be demolished, and the new building
        which now occupies the site erected. For one year the library occupied temporary
        quarters at 67 Fifth Avenue, and returned to its new home in April, 1891.
        The first load of books was taken into the new building on the morn ing of
        April 16, 1891. This building is a fire-proof structure of buff brick and
        red sandstone, seven stories high. It has a frontage on three streets as follows,
        159 feet on Eighth street, 149 feet on Astor Place, and 52 feet on Lafayette
        Place. The width of the building on the end overlooking Broadway is 98 feet.
        The library quarters are on the seventh floor, and are reached by two steam
        elevators. The circulating department for home use is on the seventh floor.
        On this floor are also the catalogue department, work-rooms, the directors''
        room, and the librarian''s office. The apartment for the storage of books
        is considered one of the finest, if not the best, for its pur pose in the
        country. In addition to having light on all sides, it has a skylight occupying
        two thirds of the roof space. The height from the floor to the sky light is
        25 feet. The full storage capacity is 475,000 volumes. At present it has a
        book-stack two tiers high, each tier being seven feet in height and so arranged
        that a third tier of seven can be added when required. This book-stack is
        fitted with adjustable shelves, the supports being the latest and most improved
        pattern. The bookcases are double, and the width from face to face is 18 inches.
        The distance between the cases is three feet. No book is beyond the reach
        of the attendant standing on the floor or on the gallery. The stairs and flooring
        of the stack are made of iron. In this room is also the prin cipal card catalogue,

        \ The New-York Academy of Medicine at No. 17 West Forty-third street possesses\
        \ a medical library of 40,000 books and 15,000 pamphlets, to which about 1500\
        \ volumes are added yearly. Its files of medical journals are the most complete\
        \ in the country, with the exception of those of the surgeon-general's office\
        \ in Washington. The academy has published a catalogue, in two parts, of American\
        \ and foreign medical periodicals, transactions, and reports. Not so large,\
        \ but of a similar nature, is the library of the New-York Hospital at No.\
        \ 6 West Sixteenth street, where 20,000 volumes on medicine, surgery, and\
        \ collateral branches are open free to students. There is also a large collection\
        \ of medical works in Mott Memorial Hall in Madison Avenue, \u2014 a son's\
        \ tribute to Valentine Mott, the most eminent surgeon this country has yet\
        \ pro duced. The Genealogical and Biographical Society in the Berkeley Lyceum\
        \ has several thousand volumes relating to biography and genealogy, also local\
        \ town and county histories, many of which are out of print and exceedingly\
        \ rare. Several of the social clubs of the city have good collections of books.\
        \ Perhaps the largest and most valuable of these is the library of the Century\
        \ Club. The City Library, comprising about seven thousand volumes, is situated\
        \ on the first floor of the City Hall, and consists chiefly of city, State,\
        \ and government pub lications, and includes a collection of French governmental\
        \ and muni cipal volumes. It originated in the attempt of Alexander Vattemare,\
        \ in 1842, to establish a foreign literary bureau or exchange which should\
        \ be controlled by the Common Council, and should be the head quarters for\
        \ literary men of all nations in visiting the city. The plan proved a failure\
        \ and was abandoned after two years' trial, \u2014 Vattemare's books, now\
        \ valued at about $40,000, remaining in the possession of the Board of Aldermen.\
        \ The library has been shamefully neglected, and is discreditable to the city.\
        \ Richard Henry Stoddard was at one time librarian, but soon resigned. The\
        \ Catholic Club at No. 120 West Fifty-ninth street has the best Catholic library\
        \ in the country. It contains 20,000 volumes, of which a large share is devoted\
        \ to theology; it is especially rich in books on Ireland and in the Irish\
        \ language, as well as in works of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,\
        \ with fine and rare engravings on copper. It has also a number of illustrated\
        \ works on the fine and ornamental arts, and a collection of books on the\
        \ numismatics of the crusaders. The nucleus of what will some day form one\
        \ of our largest libraries is to be found in the spacious residence of the\
        \ late Samuel J. Tilden. A sum aggregating between two and two and a half\
        \ millions of dollars has been placed at the disposition of the trustees of\
        \ the Tilden Library, after much vexatious litigation. Although Mr. Tilden's\

        is under the direc tion of the board of trustees, the several departments
        of its routine service being assigned to the superintendent and four librarians
        with their numerous assistants. COLUMBIA COLLEGE LIBRARY The library of Columbia
        College occupies the greater part of the principal building on the present
        site of the college, at the corner of Forty-ninth street and Madison Avenue.
        This building was erected in 1883, and contains, besides the library, lecture-rooms
        for the law school, and in the tower accommodations for the astronomical depart
        ment and the observatory. The chief architectural excellence of the building,
        aside from its handsome exterior and its general effect, is found in the great
        reading-room, which is 113 feet long by 75 feet wide and 58 feet high. Filled
        with an abundance of light from windows on all sides, its walls are surrounded
        with books to the height of twenty feet, and it is by many considered the
        handsomest reading-room in the country. The library is maintained primarily
        for the officers and students of the institution and its regular academic
        work, but it is practically open to all investigators who have occasion to
        consult a library for scholars. It is accessible throughout the entire year
        from half -past eight o''clock in the morning until ten at night. The collections
        of books belonging to Columbia College date back to the foundation of the
        institution in 1754; but for the first century of the college history the
        library did not attain great size or impor tance. Its contents previous to
        the Revolution seem to have been chiefly the result of gifts. Among the early
        donors are mentioned the Earl of Bute and the University of Oxford. The Society
        for Prop agating the Gospel in Foreign Parts, in the prosecution of its work
        in America, aided some of the struggling educational institutions, and gave
        to the library of King''s College a body of books, some of which are still
        in the library. During the Revolution and the British occu pation of New-York,
        the greater part of the library was dispersed, and much of it finally lost.
        After the close of the war, when King''s College was reorganized as Columbia
        College, the resources of the institution were too limited to foster rapid
        growth of the library. In 1792 an addition, coming from a grant of the State
        legislature, was made. In 1812 the college purchased for the library the books
        of the recently deceased Prof. John Kemp, who for many years occupied the
        chair of Mathematics and Philosophy. In 1825 the collection of', 1]

        \ \u2014 the city of Mr. Astor's adoption \u2014 when he founded the library\
        \ that bears his name. John Jacob Astor was born at Waldorf, near Heidelberg,\
        \ Germany, in the year 1763. When only sixteen, he left his father's farm,\
        \ setting out, on foot, for the Rhine ; and when resting under a tree, he\
        \ is said to have made these three resolves \u2014 \"to be honest, industrious,\
        \ and never gamble\"; and it is added that he adhered to them throughout his\
        \ long life. He went to his elder brother, at London, and engaged with him\
        \ in business some three years, after which he came to New- York. This was\
        \ in 1783; subsequently, he embarked in the fur trade, which he prosecuted\
        \ with such energy and success that in ten years his establishment at the\
        \ mouth of the Columbia River, known as Astoria, had its agencies in England,\
        \ Germany, France, and indeed in all parts of the civilized world. At the\
        \ beginning of the present century, he shrewdly invested in the real estate\
        \ of the then young city of New-York to such an extent that his property continued\
        \ to augment so largely as to constitute him the most opulent merchant in\
        \ the United States, if not in America. Although the Astor Library may not\
        \ claim precedence over other public libraries of New-York city in the order\
        \ of time, yet in respect of its distinctive character as a cosmopolitan library\
        \ of reference for scholars, its claim to priority will not be disputed As\

        made appropriate replies. He was invited to give a course of lectures on experimental
        philosophy, for which a hundred subscriptions at ten dollars were raised;
        but he refused, and proceeded soon after to Philadelphia. From Priestley we
        naturally turn to Dr. Mitchill, of whom it has been said : " He was equally
        at home in studying the geology of Niagara or the anatomy of an egg ; in offering
        suggestions as to the angle of a windmill or the shape of a gridiron; in deciphering
        a Babylonian brick or in advising how to apply steam to navigation; or in
        disputing about the Bible with his neighbor, the Jewish Rabbi." This remarkable
        man studied medicine with Dr. Samuel Bard, and in 1792 was elected to Columbia,
        as indi cated previously. There he introduced the nomenclature of Lavoisier,
        although with some modifications. Two years later he published an essay on
        the "Nomenclature of the New Chemistry," which led to a controversy with Priestley,
        which was conducted with such courtesy that it ended in the warm personal
        friendship of the two chemists. His interest in science manifested itself
        in many ways, and he was associated with Robert R. Livingston and Simeon De
        Witt in the founding of the Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, Manufac
        tures, and Useful Arts, in 1793-4. Under its auspices, in 1796, he made "a
        mineralogical exploration of the banks of the Hudson River," which was the
        earliest attempt in America in this line of research. Subsequently, in 1804,
        he published in the " New-York Medical Reporter" "A Sketch of the Mineralogical
        History of the State of New-York," and in 1809 he published a " Discourse
        on Min eralogy " in " Tilloch''s Magazine." In his presidential address before
        the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in 1882, Professor
        George J. Brush, in speaking of mineralogy, says : "As the first distinct
        beginning of the science, I may mention an association formed in 1798, in
        the city of New-York, which assumed, as they expressed it, ''the name and
        style of The American Mineralogical Society.''" According to " The New-York
        Medical Repository," a quar terly magazine founded in 1797, and of which Dr.
        Mitchill was chief editor, the object of this society was " the investigation
        of the mineral and fossd bodies which compose the fabric of the globe, and
        more especiady for the natural and chemical history of the minerals and fossils
        of the United States." Professor Brush says : " The dis . tinguished Dr. Samuel
        Latham Mitchill, who seems to have been a man of universal genius, was at
        once its first president, its librarian, and its cabinet-keeper." Meanwhile,
        in 1793, Dr. Mitchill was called to the chair of Botany in the medical department
        of Columbia College, but in 1795 resigned this charge and was succeeded by

        library is gradually accu mulating a valuable and interesting gallery of portraits,
        which already includes some of the older professors, English aud American
        bishops, benefactors of the seminary, and a Duns Scotus by Spagnoletto (Ribera),
        copies of which may be seen in the refectory of Merton College, Oxford (of
        which he was a fellow), Hampton Court, and a few other collections. In the
        reading-room are many photographs -and prints of eminent American and English
        churchmen. Rooms in the building (which is fire-proof) have been accepted
        by the General and New-York Diocesan Conventions as depositories for their
        archives. THE MERCANTILE LIBRARY On the morning of November 3, 1820, William
        Wood posted on the bulletin-board of the "Commercial Advertiser" the following
        Notice to Merchants''1 Clerks and Apprentices. Those young gentlemen who are
        disposed to form a Mercantile Library and evening reading-room, are desired
        to attend a meeting for that purpose, at the Tontine Coffee House, on Thursday
        evening next at seven o''clock, when a plan of a Library and Association will
        be presented for their consideration. The young men of South Street, Front,
        Water, Pearl, Maiden Lane, and Broadway are particularly desired to attend.1
        This meeting was held on Thursday, November 9, 1820, and thus was started
        the Mercantile Library Association. On November 27 a constitution was adopted,
        and Lucius Bull was elected the first president. By the constitution the control
        of the library was placed in the hands of merchants'' clerks ; they alone
        were permitted to vote and hold office. This provision has been continued
        up to the present time. While all persons of good character may become members
        of the library, merchants'' clerks only have a voice in the management. The
        library was opened on February 12, 1821, at 49 Fulton street, with 150 members.
        The library quarters consisted of one room, and the opening found the association
        in the possession of about 700 volumes, most of which had been presented.
        At the end of the first year the books had increased to 1000 volumes, and
        the membership to 175. In 1826 the library had 6000 volumes, and was removed
        to more spacious quarters in the building of Harper & Bros., in Cliff street.
        In the year 1827 the association gave a course of ten lectures on Com- 1 The
        original of this was preserved. It was framed, and hangs on the wall in the

        \ an effort is being made to make the collection more complete in this department.\
        \ The section containing patristic literature is quite full, and includes\
        \ the Benedictine editions and the Abbe Migne's \" Patrologia \" (both Greek\
        \ and Latin), 382 volumes. This latter set was the gift of the Society for\
        \ Promoting Religion and Learning in the State of New-York \u2014 a cor poration\
        \ which has been very generous in its grants to the library, makiug possible\
        \ the acquisition of several valuable works. This will be the more appreciated\
        \ when it is stated that the original endowment of six thousand dollars in\
        \ 1836 has not been increased at all ! Is it too much to hope that, in these\
        \ days of increasing library benefac tions, some friend of the General Seminary\
        \ of our church will pro vide, by gift or will, for the support and growth\
        \ of its library? All the standard works on the councils of the church are\
        \ to be found here, the last to be secured being a tall paper copy in vellum\
        \ of Mansi, formerly belonging to Bishop Jebb. There is a good col lection\
        \ of works on Methodism and the Methodists, including some bound volumes of\
        \ valuable and scarce pamphlets, with a bibliography of the subject, both\
        \ manuscript and printed. In this connection may be mentioned a copy of John\
        \ Wesley's prayer-book in good preservation. The shelves devoted to the periodical\
        \ literature of the church in this country are well filled, and contain complete\
        \ sets, in bound volumes, of nearly all the early magazines and papers. Current\
        \ publications, when removed from the reading-room, are reserved for binding,\
        \ and the files kept complete to date whenever possible. Journals of general\
        \ and diocesan conventions are preserved in convenient form, and this library\
        \ can safely claim the most complete collection of such pamphlets in existence.\
        \ The librarian reported to the trustees, April 30, 1892, a total of 2L,754\
        \ volumes, 13,235, or about 61 per cent., of which were in the de partment\
        \ of theology, the next largest section being history, including biography.\
        \ The library is the fortunate possessor of the monumen tal work descriptive\
        \ of Egypt which was published by the French government, and also of a set\
        \ of the \"Antiquities\" of Gr\xE6vius, Grono vius, Polanus, Sallengre, and\
        \ Pitiscus, in seventy-nine folio volumes. Little that is definite can now\
        \ be said of the pamphlet collection, except that it is large and includes\
        \ much of value. The more im portant of its contents are being classified\
        \ for binding, and as soon as put in book form will be fully catalogued by\
        \ author and subject. In 1885, when the books were moved to the new building,\
        \ the Dewey system of classification and the card catalogue were adopted.\
        \ The shelves are easily accessible to all who use the library; and while\

        \ and consultation, the library is free to all who do not abuse", 1]

        assistant librarian of Chetham''s Library for five years. At Saddle worth,
        his life was one of steady usefulness. He taught the village school in the
        chancel of the church. While teaching the young, he en deavoured to dissuade

        fervent tones, implored the Divine blessing on his head, praying that the
        enterprise on which he was engaged might prove successful. As the chaplain
        was in full canonicals, the incident caused a great sensation, and was particularly
        gratifying to the Prince." Clayton was Chaplain, and afterwards Fellow, of
        the Collegiate Church, and died in 1773. Robert Thyer, Chetham''s Librarian,
        was educated at the Grammar School. He was a man of great learning, and edited

        he stands on Scottish soil, that in his Ivanhoe " there is a mistake in every
        line." With regard, however, to historical fiction, including poems, as well
        as novels and tales, the student will find in Mr. Justin Winsor''s very learned
        and elaborate monograph (forming a distinct section of the catalogue of the
        Boston Public Library), the most full information up to the date of its publication.
        Most of the historical maps, to illustrate the text of the present work, have
        been engraved from drawings after Spruner, Putzger, Freeman, etc. Of the ancient
        maps, several have been adopted (in a revised form) from a General Atlas.
        That the maps contain more places than are referred to in the text, is not
        a disadvantage. I wish to express my obligation to a number of friends who
        have kindly lent me aid in the revisal of particular portions of the proof
        sheets of this volume. My special thanks are due, on account of this service,
        to Professor Francis Brown of the Union Theological School; to Professors
        W. D. Whitney, Tracy Peck, T. D. Seymour, W. H. Brewer, and T. R. Lounsbury,
        of Yale College ; to Mr. A. Van Name, librarian of Yale College ; and to Mr.
        W.'' L. Kingsley, to whose his torical knowledge and unfailing kindness I
        have, on previous occa sions, been indebted for like assistance. To other
        friends besides those just named, I am indebted for information on points
        made familiar to them by their special studies. G. P. F. New Haven, Sept.
